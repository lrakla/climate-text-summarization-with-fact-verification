0,Global warming is driving polar bears toward extinction,"Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.Rising global temperatures, caused by the greenhouse effect, contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the polar bear."
0,"The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists","The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground.The Little Ice Age caused crop failures and famines in Europe.The persistently cold, wet weather caused great hardship, was primarily responsible for the Great Famine of 1315–1317, and strongly contributed to the weakened immunity and malnutrition leading up to the Black Death (1348–1350)."
1,The polar bear population has been growing.,"In two areas where harvest levels have been increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations, and a third area is considered data-deficient.Of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations, one is in decline, two are increasing, seven are stable, and nine have insufficient data, as of 2017."
1,Ironic' study finds more CO2 has slightly cooled the planet,This increase of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere has produced the current episode of global warming.
1,Human additions of CO2 are in the margin of error of current measurements and the gradual increase in CO2 is mainly from oceans degassing as the planet slowly emerges from the last ice age.,"More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification."
0,They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide.,"Most carbon dioxide from human activities is released from burning coal and other fossil fuels.Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.The main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are: burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air.At present, the primary source of CO 2 emissions is the burning of coal, natural gas, and petroleum for electricity and heat."
0,The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing the most widespread bleaching ever recorded,"These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef.A March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than previously thought, seriously affecting the northern parts of the reef as a result of warming ocean temperatures.Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish.Mass coral bleaching events due to elevated ocean temperatures occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002 and 2006, and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence."

1,"If CO2 was so terrible for the planet, then installing a CO2 generator in a greenhouse would kill the plants.","At very high concentrations (100 times atmospheric concentration, or greater), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse."
1,"Sea level rise has been slow and a constant, pre-dating industrialization","Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the sea level has risen by more than 125 metres (410 ft), with rates varying from less than a mm/year to 40+ mm/year, as a result of melting ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia.Data collected by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia show the current global mean sea level trend to be 3.2 mm (0.13 in) per year, a doubling of the rate during the 20th century."
0,"Volcanoes Melting West Antarctic Glaciers, Not Global Warming","The postulated period coincides with a global clustering of volcano collapse events; perhaps global warming occurring during this time when the last glacial maximum approached its end predisposed volcanoes to collapse.Global warming associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth."
0,Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory,"Intrusions of hot magma into carbon-rich sediments may have triggered the degassing of isotopically light methane in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and the observed isotope anomaly.The eruptions would also have emitted carbon dioxide, causing global warming.The basalt lava erupted or intruded into carbonate rocks and into sediments that were in the process of forming large coal beds, both of which would have emitted large amounts of carbon dioxide, leading to stronger global warming after the dust and aerosols settled."
1,Harvard study finds that wind turbines create MORE global warming than the fossil fuels they eliminate,"Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.Over 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide per year can be eliminated by using a one-megawatt turbine instead of one megawatt of energy from a fossil fuel."

1,"CO2 increase is natural, not human-caused.","While CO 2 absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO 2 levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human (anthropogenic) activity.Human activities have caused CO 2 to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years.Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs, and nitrous oxide.[clarification needed] This increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels, deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions.It is likely that anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) warming, such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels, has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems."

1,Greenland has only lost a tiny fraction of its ice mass.,"If iceberg calving has happened as an average, Greenland lost 294 Gt of its mass during 2007 (one km3 of ice weighs about 0.9 Gt).Findings show that Greenland has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, enough to raise sea levels by almost 11mm (1.06cm).The rate of ice loss has increased from an average of 33 billion tonnes a year in the 1990s, to 254 billion tonnes a year in the last decade.Between 2000 and 2016, 29 % of the glacierized area was lost, the remaining area estimated at around 1,300 km2 (500 sq mi).Between then and 2010, the mountain lost 80 percent of its ice — two-thirds of which since another scientific expedition in the 1970s."

0,"Most glaciers are retreating, posing a serious problem for millions who rely on glaciers for water.","Following the Little Ice Age's end around 1850, glaciers around the Earth have retreated substantially.A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950 and 1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous.In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff.Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds."
0,Extreme weather events are being made more frequent and worse by global warming.,"Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, heavy rainfall with floods, and heavy snowfall; ocean acidification; and massive extinctions of species due to shifting temperature regimes.Impacts include the direct effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and loss of life; and indirect effects, such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures.The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.Global warming boosts the probability of extreme weather events, like heat waves, far more than it boosts more moderate events.Climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, extreme temperatures, flooding, high winds, and severe storms."
0,A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.,"Between 1993 and 2017, the global mean sea level rose on average by 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with an acceleration detected as well.Since at least the start of the 20th century, the average global sea level has been rising.Between 1900 and 2016, the sea level rose by 16–21 cm (6.3–8.3 in).More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements reveal an accelerating rise of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017, which is a trend of roughly 30 cm (12 in) per century.Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the sea level has risen by more than 125 metres (410 ft), with rates varying from less than a mm/year to 40+ mm/year, as a result of melting ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia."
0,The most recent ocean measurements show consistent warming.,"The global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature, show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C, in the period 1880 to 2012, based on multiple independently produced datasets.From 1961 to 2003, the global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10 °C from the surface to a depth of 700 m. There is variability both year-to-year and over longer time scales, with global ocean heat content observations showing high rates of warming for 1991 to 2003, but some cooling from 2003 to 2007.""Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level.""The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report stated that: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, the widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level."
0,The natural cycle adds and removes CO2 to keep a balance; humans add extra CO2 without removing any.,"Since the industrial revolution, human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components' functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere.Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of calcination of limestone for clinker production, which releases CO 2.The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation)."
0,"Rising CO2 increases atmospheric water vapor, which makes global warming much worse.","Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.Not only do increasing carbon dioxide concentrations lead to increases in global surface temperature, but increasing global temperatures also cause increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide.Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to an increase in dissolved CO2, which causes ocean acidification.Indirectly, human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations, a process known as water vapor feedback."
0,Polar bears are in danger of extinction as well as many other species.,"Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.""Global habitat loss and extinction risk of terrestrial vertebrates under future land-use-change scenarios"".There is widespread consensus among scientists that human activity is accelerating the extinction of many animal species through the destruction of habitats, the consumption of animals as resources, and the elimination of species that humans view as threats or competitors.The key danger posed by climate change is malnutrition or starvation due to habitat loss."

0,The effects of enhanced CO2 on terrestrial plants are variable and complex and dependent on numerous factors.,"Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide certainly affects plant morphology and is acidifying oceans, and temperature affects species ranges, phenology, and weather, but, mercifully, the major impacts that have been predicted are still potential futures.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can also be altered in plants exposed to high concentrations of CO 2.Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide affects plants in a variety of ways."
0,Thick arctic sea ice is in rapid retreat.,"The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation.In 2002 the 12 km (7.5 mi) long floating terminus of the glacier entered a phase of rapid retreat, with the ice front breaking up and the floating terminus disintegrating and accelerating to a retreat rate of over 30 m (98 ft) per day.A composite record of Arctic ice demonstrates that the floes' retreat began around 1900, experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50 years."
0,There is long-term correlation between CO2 and global temperature; other effects are short-term.,"Gore's use of long ice core records of CO2 and temperature (from oxygen isotope measurements) in Antarctic ice cores to illustrate the correlation between the two drew some scrutiny; Schmidt, Steig and Michael E. Mann back up Gore's data.During the glacial cycles, there was a high correlation between CO 2 concentrations and temperatures.El Niño events cause short-term (approximately 1 year in length) spikes in global average surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling.This trend could be extrapolated to continue into the future, possibly leading to a full ice age, but the twentieth-century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden reversal of this trend, with a rise in global temperatures attributed to greenhouse gas emissions.There is also a close correlation between CO2 and temperature, where CO2 has a strong control over global temperatures in Earth history."

0,"Melting ice leads to more sunlight being absorbed by water, thus heating the Arctic.","The Arctic gradually loses snow and ice, bare rock and water absorb more and more of the sun's energy, making the Arctic even warmer.Arctic Sea ice melts in the summer, and more of the sun is being absorbed by the ocean.The fast rate of the sea ice melting is resulting in the oceans absorbing and heating up the Arctic.The primary cause of this phenomenon is ice-albedo feedback, where by melting ice uncovers darker land or ocean beneath, which then absorbs more sunlight, causing more heating."
0,Multiple lines of evidence make it very clear that the rise in atmospheric CO2 is due to human emissions.,"CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 were equivalent to 49 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (using the most recent global warming potentials over 100 years from the AR5 report).The sharp acceleration in CO 2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2 ppm per year) from 1.1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations.The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity.While ‘climate change’ can be due to natural forces or human activity, there is now substantial evidence to indicate that human activity – and specifically increased greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions – is a key factor in the pace and extent of global temperature increases."
0,That humans are causing the rise in atmospheric CO2 is confirmed by multiple isotopic analyses.,"While CO 2 absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO 2 levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human (anthropogenic) activity.Analysis of carbon isotopes in atmospheric CO 2 shows that the recent observed CO 2 increase cannot have come from the oceans, volcanoes, or the biosphere, and thus is not a response to rising temperatures as would be required if the same processes creating past lags were active now.Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 were equivalent to 49 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (using the most recent global warming potentials over 100 years from the AR5 report)."
0,"CO2 levels are rising so fast that unless we decrease emissions, global warming will accelerate this century.","Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.Between 1993 and 2017, the global mean sea level rose on average by 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with an acceleration detected as well.CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.To keep warming below 2 °C, more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030."
0,Preventing global warming is relatively cheap; business-as-usual will cause accelerating climate damage costs that economists struggle to even estimate.,Many economists estimate the cost of climate change mitigation at between 1% and 2% of GDP.Researchers have warned that current economic modeling may seriously underestimate the impact of potentially catastrophic climate change and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages.Global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related events since the 1970s.The total economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate.

0,Greenland's ice loss is accelerating & will add metres of sea level rise in upcoming centuries.,"If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely, the world's sea level would rise by more than 7 m (23 ft).The glaciers of Greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level faster than was previously believed.Findings show that Greenland has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, enough to raise sea levels by almost 11mm (1.06cm).The contribution of the Greenland ice sheet on sea level over the next couple of centuries can be very high due to a self-reinforcing cycle (a so-called positive feedback)."
0,"Natural cycles superimposed on a linear warming trend can be mistaken for step changes, but the underlying warming is caused by the external radiative forcing.","Positive radiative forcing leads to warming by increasing the net incoming energy, whereas negative radiative forcing leads to cooling.AR4 describes warming and cooling effects on the planet in terms of radiative forcing — the rate of change of energy in the system, measured as power per unit area (in SI units, W/m²).Positive radiative forcing results in warming."
0,"A few degrees of global warming has a huge impact on ice sheets, sea levels and other aspects of climate.","The rate of ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets in the Antarctic is a key area of uncertainty since this source could account for 90% of the potential sea level rise: increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, potentially resulting in more rapid sea level rise.The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.Under the influence of global warming, melt at the base of the ice sheet increases."
1,Satellite transmissions are extremely small and irrelevant.,"Each satellite provides three transmission beams that can support 50 channels each, carrying news, music, entertainment, and education, and including a computer multimedia service.Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent Ku band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the solar panels and energy efficiency of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the digital modulation methods now used require less signal strength at the receiver than analog modulation methods."

0,"The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet.","The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere.Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric carbon dioxide traps energy near the surface, warming the surface and the lower atmosphere.Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this results in further warming and so is a ""positive feedback"" that amplifies the original warming."

0,Climate sensitivity can be calculated empirically by comparing past temperature change to natural forcings at the time.,"Climate sensitivity is the globally averaged temperature change in response to changes in radiative forcing, which can occur, for instance, due to increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2).One way is to use estimates of global radiative forcing and temperature directly.Climate sensitivity can be estimated using observed temperature rise, observed ocean heat uptake, and modeled or observed radiative forcing.Climate sensitivity is typically estimated in three ways; by using observations taken during the industrial age, by using temperature and other data from the Earth's past and by modelling the climate system in computers."
1,"Some global warming 'skeptics' argue that the Earth's climate sensitivity is so low that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will result in a surface temperature change on the order of 1°C or less, and that therefore global warming is nothing to worry about.","In his first paper on the matter, he estimated that global temperature would rise by around 5 to 6 °C (9.0 to 10.8 °F) if the quantity of CO 2 was doubled.The 1990 IPCC First Assessment Report estimated that equilibrium climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO 2 lay between 1.5 and 4.5 °C (2.7 and 8.1 °F), with a ""best guess in the light of current knowledge"" of 2.5 °C (4.5 °F)."

0,"The current debate on the connection between CO2 emissions and climate change has largely overlooked an independent and equally serious problem, the increasing acidity of our oceans.","As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, the increased uptake of carbon dioxide into the oceans is causing a measurable decrease in the pH of the oceans, which is referred to as ocean acidification.Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in their Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report: ""The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units.This will cause an elevation of ocean alkalinity, leading to the enhancement of the ocean as a reservoir for CO 2 with implications for climate change as more CO 2 leaves the atmosphere for the ocean."
0,"Last December, the respected  journal “Oceanography” published projections (see graphic below) for this rising acidity, measured by falling pH","Limiting global warming to below 2 °C would imply a reduction in surface ocean pH of 0.16 from pre-industrial levels.It is expected to drop by a further 0.3 to 0.5 pH units (an additional doubling to tripling of today's post-industrial acid concentrations) by 2100 as the oceans absorb more anthropogenic CO 2, the impacts being most severe for coral reefs and the Southern Ocean."

0,Short term cooling over the last few years is largely due to a strong La Nina phase in the Pacific Ocean and a prolonged solar minimum.,"An especially strong Walker circulation causes La Niña, resulting in cooler ocean temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean due to increased upwelling.During a period of La Niña, the sea surface temperature across the equatorial Eastern Central Pacific Ocean will be lower than normal by 3 to 5°C (5.4 to 9°F).La Niña is the positive and cold phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean."
0,The IPCC blames human emissions of carbon dioxide for the last  warming.,"Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.Cumulative anthropogenic (i.e., human-emitted) emissions of CO 2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming, and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change.Human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8 °C (1.5 °F) over the past 140 years.The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases."
0,Greenhouse gases have been the main contributor of warming since 1970.,"In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be warmer by about 33 °C (59 °F) than it would be in their absence.Human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8 °C (1.5 °F) over the past 140 years."

0,"There are a number of forcings which affect climate (eg - stratospheric aerosols, solar variations).","These include processes such as variations in solar radiation, variations in the Earth's orbit, variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans, mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.Volcanic eruptions, solar variations and anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere and land use change are external forcings.These external forcings can be natural, such as variations in solar intensity and volcanic eruptions, or caused by humans.Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, Milankovitch cycles (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the stratosphere."
0,The main reason behind this mid-century cooling was global dimming due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions.,"Although the temperature drops foreseen by this mechanism have now been discarded in light of better theory and the observed warming, aerosols are thought to have contributed a cooling tendency (outweighed by increases in greenhouse gases) and also have contributed to ""Global Dimming.""While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled.From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning."

0,"Volcanoes have been relatively frequent and if anything, have exerted a cooling effect.","Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere (or troposphere); however, they also absorb heat radiated from the Earth, thereby warming the upper atmosphere (or stratosphere).This magma tends to be extremely viscous because of its high silica content, so it often does not attain the surface but cools and solidifies at depth.Such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of sulfur and ash released into the atmosphere."

Stevens wrote: ""The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant cause of the observed warming of the last 50 years."

0,Warming causes more moisture in the air which leads to more extreme precipitation events.,"Over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropical regions, extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and frequent.As air gets warmer, it can hold more moisture.Further examples include sea level rise, widespread melting of snow and land ice, increased heat content of the oceans, increased humidity, and the earlier timing of spring events, such as the flowering of plants."
0,"Far from contradicting global warming, record snowfall is predicted by climate models and consistent with our expectation of more extreme precipitation events.","The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, documented by many independent scientific groups; for example, in most continental regions the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation has increased.Simultaneously, the capacity of the atmosphere to carry precipitation increases with temperature so that precipitation, in the form of snowfall, increases in global and regional models.Climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, extreme temperatures, flooding, high winds, and severe storms."

0,"Volcanoes, solar variations, clouds, methane, aerosols - these all change the way energy enters and/or leaves our climate.","These include processes such as variations in solar radiation, variations in the Earth's orbit, variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans, mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.These external forcings can be natural, such as variations in solar intensity and volcanic eruptions, or caused by humans.Solid and liquid particles known as aerosols – from volcanoes, plankton, and human-made pollutants – reflect incoming sunlight, cooling the climate."
0,"While there are many drivers of climate, CO2 is the most dominant radiative forcing and is increasing faster than any other forcing.","The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO2 and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO2 absorbs outgoing long-wave energy.Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs, and nitrous oxide."

0,"""The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, 2007, carries in three places a graph in which the Hadley Center’s global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset from 1850-2005 is displayed with four arbitrarily-chosen trend-lines overlaid upon it.","The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) published in 2007 featured a graph showing 12 proxy based temperature reconstructions, including the three highlighted in the 2001 Third Assessment Report (TAR); Mann, Bradley & Hughes 1999 as before, Jones et al."
1,"""Disasters Cost More Than Ever — But Not Because of Climate Change"" (Roger Pielke Jr.)","By addressing climate change, we can avoid the costs associated with the effects of climate change."
0,"the satellite sensors show less warming in the lower troposphere (approximately 10,000 feet above the earth’s surface) than is reported by surface temperature readings.","According to basic physical principles, the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), but cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere)."
1,CO2 constitutes 80% of the non-condensing greenhouse gas forcing.,"The trucking and haulage industry plays a part in production of CO 2, contributing around 20% of the UK's total carbon emissions a year, with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%.Overall, developed countries accounted for 83.8% of industrial CO 2 emissions over this time period, and 67.8% of total CO 2 emissions."
0,"""Cloud cover in models is poorly treated and inaccurately predicted.","Leading global models produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases."
0,"Given that a doubling of carbon dioxide would change the surface heat flux by only two watts per square meter, it is evident that a small change in cloud cover can strongly affect the response to carbon dioxide.""","The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and probably the net effect of clouds.While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore considered feedbacks."
1,the Great Barrier Reef is in fine fettle,"The percentage of baby corals being born on the Great Barrier Reef dropped drastically in 2018 and scientists are describing it as the early stage of a ""huge natural selection event unfolding""."
0,"""There are other possible causes for climate change which could be associated with solar activity or related to variations in the temperature of the liquid core of the Earth, which is about 5,400 degrees Celsius.","Henrik Svensmark has suggested that the magnetic activity of the sun deflects cosmic rays, and that this may influence the generation of cloud condensation nuclei, and thereby have an effect on the climate.Some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are: increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, for a warming effect global changes to land surface, such as deforestation, for a warming effect increasing atmospheric concentrations of aerosols, mainly for a cooling effect In addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause climate change, including for example, climate oscillations, changes in solar activity, and volcanic activity."
0,"Over the last decade, heatwaves are five times more likely than if there had been no global warming.","Australia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts.The effects of climate change have been projected to make heat waves in places such as Europe up to five times more likely to occur."
