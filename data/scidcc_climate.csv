At the same time, the study's authors indirectly found that stocks of fish and other aquatic foods also rise with temperatures, leading to slightly larger catches each time peopled fished. Without careful analysis, it would appear that overall fish catches appear unchanged annually, when in fact, more nuanced dynamics are at play.The study highlights why it's necessary when studying changing environmental conditions to include human behavior along with ecosystem responses; both are key variables when considering how climate change affects rural livelihoods, food production and food access.The paper, ""Fishers' Response to Temperature Change Reveals the Importance of Integrating Human Behavior in Climate Change Analysis,"" published April 30 in the journal ""This study underscores the importance of pulling human behavior into climate change modeling,"" said Kathryn Fiorella, an assistant professor in the Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences and Master of Public Health Program in the College of Veterinary Medicine. ""To accurately predict the impacts of climate change, we need to know about the effects on ecological systems, and also the effects on people who use them.""In the study, Fiorella and colleagues used data provided by partner organization WorldFish, which collected survey data every two months over three years for households in Cambodia, which has the world's highest per-capita consumption of inland fish. WorldFish collected information on how often people fished, how much time they spent when they fished, and what method they used.The researchers used remotely sensed temperature data over the same three-year period, which revealed a range of 24 to 31 degrees Celsius (75 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit). The researchers also controlled for rainfall and flooding.""The temperatures in the range of the study compare to regional climate projections in the area, which suggest around a 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius [2.7 to 4.5 F] temperature rise above the average of 28 degrees Celsius [82.4 F],"" Fiorella said. ""What we observed is in range for what we might expect under climate change scenarios.""The researchers found time spent fishing per outing and the gear choices were not affected by temperature, but fewer people fished as temperatures rose.They also analyzed fish catch. It turns out that, with effort holding constant, fish catch per outing went up as temperatures rose, which meant the ecosystem became a little more productive when it was warmer. The same pattern was true for other aquatic animals, like frogs or snakes, and aquatic plants. However, without factoring in effects of temperature on human behavior, it might have looked like temperature had no effect.The researchers suspect that fishing frequency declined as temperatures rose due to competing interests. ""These households have a suite of different activities they are engaged in at the same time,"" Fiorella said, noting many of them are rice farmers or run small businesses. At the same time, heat may also be a factor, she added.Fiorella added that large swaths of the population migrate to cities or nearby countries for work, and these dynamics could be pulling them away from fishing.""Ultimately,"" she said, ""understanding both ecosystem responses and people's responses to temperature is going to be fundamental to understanding how climate change affects people who are directly reliant on the natural resources for their food and income.""The study was funded by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and the WorldFish's Rice Field Fisheries Enhancement project, which is supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development.",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study conducted in Cambodia reveals the complex relationship between rising temperatures, human behavior, and fish catches.

Photosynthesis is the major source of building blocks for organisms on Earth. However, too much sunlight reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis because it damages the 'solar panels', i.e. the photosynthetic machineries of cyanobacteria, algae and plants. A team of researchers led by LMU biologist Dario Leister has now used ""artificial laboratory evolution"" to identify mutations that enable unicellular cyanobacteria to tolerate high levels of light. The long-term aim of the project is to find ways of endowing crop plants with the ability to cope with the effects of climate change.The cyanobacteria used in the study were derived from a strain of cells that were used to grow at low levels of light. ""To enable them to emerge from the shadows, so to speak, we exposed these cells to successively higher light intensities,"" says Leister. In an evolutionary process based on mutation and selection, the cells adapted to the progressive alteration in lighting conditions -- and because each cell divides every few hours, the adaptation process proceeded at a far higher rate than would have been possible with green plants. To help the process along, the researchers increased the natural mutation rate by treating cells with mutagenic chemicals and irradiating them with UV light. By the end of the experiment, the surviving blue-green algae were capable of tolerating light intensities that were higher than the maximal levels that can occur on Earth under natural conditions.To the team's surprise, most of the over 100 mutations that could be linked to increased tolerance to bright light resulted in localized changes in the structures of single proteins. ""In other words, the mutations involved primarily affect the properties of specific proteins rather than altering the regulatory mechanisms that determine how much of any given protein is produced,"" Leister explains. As a control, the team then introduced the genes for two of the altered proteins, which affect photosynthesis in different ways, into non-adapted strains. -- And in each case, they found that the change indeed enabled the altered cells to tolerate higher light intensities than the progenitor strain.Enhancing the tolerance of crop plants to higher or fluctuating light intensities potentially provides a means of increasing productivity, and is of particular interest against the background of ongoing global climate change. ""Application of genetic engineering techniques to plant breeding has so far concentrated on quantitative change -- on making more or less of a specific protein,"" says Leister. ""Our strategy makes qualitative change possible, allowing us to identify new protein variants with novel functions. Insofar as these variants retain their function in multicellular organisms, it should be possible to introduce them into plants.""",Climate,2021.0,"A team of researchers led by biologist Dario Leister has used ""artificial laboratory evolution"" to identify mutations in cyanobacteria that enable them to tolerate high levels of light.

The material has a variety of applications in the energy, medical, and fashion sectors. The research is published in the journal ""Three-dimensional printing is a powerful technology for fabrication of living functional materials that have a huge potential in a wide range of environmental and human-based applications."" says Srikkanth Balasubramanian, a postdoctoral research associate at Delft and the first author of the paper. ""We provide the first example of an engineered photosynthetic material that is physically robust enough to be deployed in real-life applications.""To create the photosynthetic materials, the researchers began with a non-living bacterial cellulose -- an organic compound that is produced and excreted by bacteria. Bacterial cellulose has many unique mechanical properties, including its flexibility, toughness, strength, and ability to retain its shape, even when twisted, crushed, or otherwise physically distorted.The bacterial cellulose is like the paper in a printer, while living microalgae acts as the ink. The researchers used a 3D printer to deposit living algae onto the bacterial cellulose.The combination of living (microalgae) and nonliving (bacterial cellulose) components resulted in a unique material that has the photosynthetic quality of the algae and the robustness of the bacterial cellulose; the material is tough and resilient while also eco-friendly, biodegradable, and simple and scalable to produce. The plant-like nature of the material means it can use photosynthesis to ""feed"" itself over periods of many weeks, and it is also able to be regenerated -- a small sample of the material can be grown on-site to make more materials.The unique characteristics of the material make it an ideal candidate for a variety of applications, including new products such as artificial leaves, photosynthetic skins, or photosynthetic bio-garments.Artificial leaves are materials that mimic actual leaves in that they use sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide -- a major driver of climate change -- into oxygen and energy, much like leaves during photosynthesis. The leaves store energy in chemical form as sugars, which can then be converted into fuels. Artificial leaves therefore offer a way to produce sustainable energy in places where plants don't grow well, including outer space colonies. The artificial leaves produced by the researchers at Delft and Rochester are additionally made from eco-friendly materials, in contrast to most artificial leaf technologies currently in production, which are produced using toxic chemical methods.""For artificial leaves, our materials are like taking the 'best parts' of plants -- the leaves -- which can create sustainable energy, without needing to use resources to produce parts of plants -- the stems and the roots -- that need resources but don't produce energy,"" says Anne S. Meyer, an associate professor of biology at Rochester. ""We are making a material that is only focused on the sustainable production of energy.""Another application of the material would be photosynthetic skins, which could be used for skin grafts, Meyer says. ""The oxygen generated would help to kick-start healing of the damaged area, or it might be able to carry out light-activated wound healing.""Besides offering sustainable energy and medical treatments, the materials could also change the fashion sector. Bio-garments made from algae would address some of the negative environmental effects of the current textile industry in that they would be high-quality fabrics that would be sustainability produced and completely biodegradable. They would also work to purify the air by removing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and would not need to be washed as often as conventional garments, reducing water usage.""Our living materials are promising because they can survive for several days with no water or nutrients access, and the material itself can be used as a seed to grow new living materials,"" says Marie-Eve Aubin-Tam, an associate professor of bionanoscience at Delft.

3,3-May-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210503104810.htm,Less precipitation means less plant diversity,"Water is a scarce resource in many of the Earth's ecosystems. This scarcity is likely to increase in the course of climate change. This, in turn, might lead to a considerable decline in plant diversity. Using experimental data from all over the world, scientists from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ), the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), and the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) have demonstrated for the first time that plant biodiversity in drylands is particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation. In an article published in ","How will climate change affect the Earth's ecosystems? How will biodiversity in different regions change? Such important questions about the future are difficult to answer. In order to do so, it is important to know how the individual species and their communities will react to changing precipitation conditions, for example. But despite numerous scientific experiments worldwide, we do not have synthetic, global answers to these questions. For example, experiments differ greatly in their methodology, such as whether they add small or large amounts of water. ""These studies use different methods and are located in different regions of the world,"" says first author Dr. Lotte Korell, a biologist at the UFZ. ""And these studies yield contradictory results in many cases."" Together with her colleagues, she has therefore set out to derive a general understanding from the data collected worldwide. The focus was on how an increase or decrease in precipitation affects the plant diversity of terrestrial ecosystems.In their search, she and her team found 23 usable publications, which presented results from 72 field experiments. With this data, they calculated various statistical variables that provided information about the biodiversity at the individual sites and related them to the increasing or decreasing amounts of rainfall.""However, in such experiments, biodiversity depends on many factors,"" says Prof. Dr. Tiffany Knight, last author of the study and ecologist at the UFZ, iDiv, and MLU. For example, the size of the experiment plays an important role. If you focus on only a single experimental plot, then you might see dramatic effects of treatments on biodiversity, as plots with less water have fewer plant individuals growing there, and thus fewer species. However, at least one individual of every species might be found in at the larger scale, and thus a lower effect of the treatment on biodiversity. Indeed, the researchers found that increasing dryness has a greater effect when it is considered at small compared to larger spatial scales. ""Thus, in order to draw the right conclusions from the data, you have to take into account both the local climate conditions and the spatial scale of the experiments,"" says Knight.In this way, the researchers have identified a clear trend. In the drylands of the world, changes in precipitation levels have a much greater effect than in wetter regions.Dry ecosystems currently occupy about 40% of the Earth's land surface. It is not easy to predict what awaits these areas against the backdrop of climate change. Although climate models do predict increasing rainfall in some dry regions, the water shortage is likely to worsen in most of them.According to the study, plant diversity is expected to increase where it becomes wetter. This is probably because the seeds of the species found there may have a better chance of germinating and becoming established.However, in light of the projected expansion of drylands, this effect is likely to benefit only relatively few regions. According to the authors, this would lead to a noticeable decline in plant diversity. ""Although the plants there have adapted to the challenges of their habitats over long periods of time,"" says Korell, ""at some point, even the most resilient survivor reaches its limits."" And with every species that dries up and can no longer germinate, biodiversity is reduced.This could be bad news not only for the ecosystems but also for the inhabitants of the dry regions. After all, they account for about one third of the world's population. Many of these people struggle to make a living from the land under the most difficult conditions. If biodiversity declines along with the rainfall, this is likely to become an even greater challenge. For Korell and her colleagues, this is another pressing argument for slowing climate change. ""It is also important to protect the drylands particularly well,"" says the researcher. The more these sensitive ecosystems are put under pressure from overgrazing and other stress factors, the more climate change is likely to affect plant diversity.",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study aimed to understand the effects of changing precipitation levels on plant diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. The researchers analyzed data from 72 field experiments conducted worldwide. Contradictory results were found in many cases due to variations in experimental methodology and locations.

As dry ecosystems cover about 40% of the Earth's land surface, the projected expansion of drylands could lead to a decline in plant diversity, affecting both ecosystems and the livelihoods of the one-third of the world's population residing in these regions. Protecting drylands and slowing climate change were emphasized as crucial actions to safeguard plant diversity.","A recent study aimed to understand the effects of changing precipitation levels on plant diversity in terrestrial ecosystems.

""Our results suggest that Afrotropical species will be even more exposed to the impact of climate change than most species from the temperate zone of the Palearctic.

In addition, countries where waterbirds are most exposed to climate change will also face climate change adaptation challenges for their human population,"" adds Szabolcs Nagy, from Wetlands International, the lead author of the study.

It's an important understanding because these northern forests absorb a significant amount of Earth's carbon dioxide.","The finding, reached by studying 30 years of the world's forests using NASA satellite imaging data, suggests that forests won't be able to sequester as much carbon as previously expected, making efforts to reduce carbon emissions all the more urgent.""Fires are intensifying, and when forests burn, carbon is released into the atmosphere,"" says Boston University environmental earth scientist Mark Friedl, senior author on the study published in Today's forests capture about 30 percent of all human-related CO""Current Earth systems models appear to be misrepresenting a big chunk of the global biosphere. These models simulate the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere, and our results suggest [the model-based simulation of northern forests] has been way off,"" says Friedl, a BU College of Arts & Sciences professor of earth and environment and interim director of BU's Center for Remote Sensing. He is an expert in utilizing satellite imaging data to monitor Earth's ecosystems on a global scale.""It is not enough for a forest to absorb and store carbon in its wood and soils. For that to be a real benefit, the forest has to remain intact -- an increasing challenge in a warming, more fire-prone climate,"" says Jonathan Wang, the paper's lead author. ""The far north is home to vast, dense stores of carbon that are very sensitive to climate change, and it will take a lot of monitoring and effort to make sure these forests and their carbon stores remain intact.""Working on his PhD in Friedl's lab, Wang researched new ways to leverage the record of data collected from the long-standing Landsat program, a joint NASA/US Geological Survey mission that has been extensively imaging Earth's surface from satellites for decades, to understand how Earth's forests are changing. Wang says new computational and machine learning techniques for combining large remote sensing datasets have become much more advanced, ""enabling the monitoring of even the most remote ecosystems with unprecedented detail.""He developed a method to gain richer information from 30 years of Landsat data by comparing it with more recent measurements from NASA's ICESat mission, a satellite carrying laser-based imaging technology, called LiDAR, that can detect the height of vegetation within a forest. Landsat, on the other hand, primarily detects forest cover but not how tall the trees are.Comparing the newer LiDAR measurements with imaging data gathered from Landsat during the same time period, the team then worked backwards to calculate how tall and dense the vegetation was over the last three decades. They could then determine how the biomass in Earth's northern forests has changed over time -- revealing that the forests have been losing more biomass than expected due to increasingly frequent and extensive forest fires.Specifically, Friedl says, the forests are losing conifers, trees that are emblematic of Earth's northern forests, and for good reason. ""Fires come in and burn, and then the most opportunistic types of species grow back first -- like hardwoods -- which then get replaced by conifers such as black spruce,"" he says. ""But over the last 30 years, which isn't a long time frame in the context of climate change, we see fires taking out more forests, and we see hardwoods sticking around longer rather than being replaced by conifers.""Conifers are better adapted to cold climates than hardwoods, which could potentially be contributing to the dwindling overall biomass of the forests.""An often-stated argument against climate action is the supposed benefits that far northern ecosystems and communities will enjoy from increased warmth,"" Wang says. He hopes the study's discovery will help people understand that the global climate crisis has serious issues for the far north, as well. ""It may be greening, in some sense,"" he says, ""but in reality the climate-driven increase in wildfires is undoing much of the potential benefits of a warming, greening north.""Wang and Friedl's findings shed light on a question that would have been difficult to answer without the help of NASA's ""eyes in the sky.""""Fire regimens are changing because of climate, and many areas of the world's forests are in uninhabited areas where the effects of intense fires may not be easily noticed,"" Friedl says. ""When big chunks of real estate in places like California go up in flames, that gets our attention. But northern forests, which hold some of the largest stocks of carbon in the world, are being impacted by fires more than we realized until now.""",Climate,2021.0,"A study utilizing NASA satellite imaging data reveals that Earth's northern forests are losing more biomass than previously estimated due to increasing forest fires.

The cyclone led to the third-lowest sea ice extent ever recorded. But what made the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2016 particularly appealing to scientists was the proximity of the Korean icebreaker Araon.,"For the first time ever, scientists were able to see exactly what happens to the ocean and sea ice when a cyclone hits. University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers and their international colleagues recently published a new study showing that sea ice declined 5.7 times faster than normal during the storm. They were also able to prove that the rapid decline was driven by cyclone-triggered processes within the ocean.""Generally, when storms come in, they decrease sea ice, but scientists didn't understand what really caused it,"" said lead author Xiangdong Zhang from the UAF International Arctic Research Center.There was general speculation that sea ice declined solely from atmospheric processes melting ice from above. Zhang and his team proved this theory incomplete using ""in-situ"" observations from directly inside the cyclone. The measurements reflected things like air and ocean temperature, radiation, wind and ocean currents.It was a stroke of good luck for science, and perhaps a bit nerve-racking for those onboard, that the icebreaker was in position to capture data from the cyclone. Usually ships try to avoid such storms, but Araon had just sailed into the middle of an ice-covered zone and was locked in an ice floe.Thanks to the ship's position so close to the storm, Xiangdong and his team were able to explain that cyclone-related sea ice loss is primarily due to two physical ocean processes.First, strong spinning winds force the surface water to move away from the cyclone. This draws deeper warm water to the surface. Despite this warm water upwelling, a small layer of cool water remains directly beneath the sea ice.That's where a second process comes into play. The strong cyclone winds act like a blender, mixing the surface water.Together, the warm water upwelling and the surface turbulence warm the entire upper ocean water column and melt the sea ice from below.Although the August storm raged for only 10 days, there were lasting effects.""It's not just the storm itself,"" explained Zhang. ""It has lingering effects because of the enhanced ice-albedo feedback.""The enlarged patches of open water from the storm absorb more heat, which melts more sea ice, causing even more open water. From Aug. 13-22, the amount of sea ice in the entire Arctic Ocean declined by 230,000 square miles, an area more than twice the size of the state of Arizona.Xiangdong is now working with a new computer model for the Department of Energy to evaluate whether climate change will lead to more Arctic cyclones. Previous research shows that over the past half-century, the number and intensity of cyclones in the Arctic have increased. Some of those storms, like the biggest Arctic cyclone on record in 2012, also led to record low sea ice extent.",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks provides new insights into the impact of cyclones on ocean and sea ice.

Now, a team of atmospheric chemists and lightning scientists have found that lightning bolts and, surprisingly, subvisible discharges that cannot be seen by cameras or the naked eye produce extreme amounts of the hydroxyl radical -- OH -- and hydroperoxyl radical -- HO","The hydroxyl radical is important in the atmosphere because it initiates chemical reactions and breaks down molecules like the greenhouse gas methane. OH is the main driver of many compositional changes in the atmosphere.""Initially, we looked at these huge OH and HOThe data was from an instrument on a plane flown above Colorado and Oklahoma in 2012 looking at the chemical changes that thunderstorms and lightning make to the atmosphere.But a few years ago, Brune took the data off the shelf, saw that the signals were really hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl, and then worked with a graduate student and research associate to see if these signals could be produced by sparks and subvisible discharges in the laboratory. Then they did a reanalysis of the thunderstrom and lightning dataset.""With the help of a great undergraduate intern,"" said Brune, ""we were able to link the huge signals seen by our instrument flying through the thunderstorm clouds to the lightning measurements made from the ground.""The researchers report their results online today (April 29) in Brune notes that airplanes avoid flying through the rapidly rising cores of thunderstorms because it is dangerous, but can sample the anvil, the top portion of the cloud that spreads outward in the direction of the wind. Visible lightning happens in the part of the anvil near the thunderstorm core.""Through history, people were only interested in lightning bolts because of what they could do on the ground,"" said Brune. ""Now there is increasing interest in the weaker electrical discharges in thunderstorms that lead to lightning bolts.""Most lightning never strikes the ground, and the lightning that stays in the clouds is particularly important for affecting ozone, and important greenhouse gas, in the upper atmosphere. It was known that lightning can split water to form hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl, but this process had never been observed before in thunderstorms.What confused Brune's team initially was that their instrument recorded high levels of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl in areas of the cloud where there was no lightning visible from the aircraft or the ground. Experiments in the lab showed that weak electrical current, much less energetic than that of visible lightning, could produce these same components.While the researchers found hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl in areas with subvisible lightning, they found little evidence of ozone and no evidence of nitric oxide, which requires visible lightning to form. If subvisible lightning occurs routinely, then the hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl these electrical events create need to be included in atmospheric models. Currently, they are not.According to the researchers, ""Lightning-generated OH (hydroxyl) in all storms happening globally can be responsible for a highly uncertain but substantial 2% to 16% of global atmospheric OH oxidation.""""These results are highly uncertain, partly because we do not know how these measurements apply to the rest of the globe,"" said Brune. ""We only flew over Colorado and Oklahoma. Most thunderstorms are in the tropics. The whole structure of high plains storms is different than those in the tropics. Clearly we need more aircraft measurements to reduce this uncertainty.""Other researchers at Penn State include Patrick J. McFarland, undergraduate; David O. Miller, doctoral recipient; and Jena M. Jenkins, doctoral candidate, all in meteorology and atmospheric science.Also working on the project were Eric Bruning, associate professor of atmospheric science, Texas Tech University; Sean Waugh, research meteorologist, and Donald MacGorman, senior research scientist, both at NOAA National Severe Storm Laboratory; Xinrong Ren, physical scientist, NOAA Air Resources Laboratory; Jingqiu Mao, assistant professor of atmospheric chemistry, Univeristy of Alaska; and Jeff Peischl, senior professional research assistant, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder.The National Science Foundation, NASA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration supported this work.",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists at Penn State University have discovered that lightning in thunderstorms produces hydroxyl (OH) radicals, which are crucial in initiating chemical reactions and breaking down greenhouse gases like methane in the atmosphere.

They voyaged from island to island and ultimately to shore, surviving on bountiful seaweeds, fish, shellfish, birds and game harvested from coastal and nearshore biomes. Their island-rich route was possible due to a shifting archipelago that stretched almost 900 miles from one continent to the other.","A new study from the University of Kansas in partnership with universities in Bologna and Urbino, Italy, documents the newly named Bering Transitory Archipelago and then points to how, when and where the first Americans may have crossed. The authors' stepping-stones hypothesis depends on scores of islands that emerged during the last ice age as sea level fell when ocean waters were locked in glaciers and later rose when ice sheets melted. The two-part study, just published in the open-access journal The ""stepping-stones"" idea hinges on retrospective mapping of sea levels while accounting for isostacy -- deformation of the Earth's crust due to the changing depth and weight of ice and water, reaching its greatest extreme during the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,500 years ago.""We digitally discovered a geographic feature of considerable size that had never been properly documented in scientific literature,"" said principal author Jerome Dobson, professor emeritus of geography at KU. ""We named it the Bering Transitory Archipelago; it existed from about 30,000 years ago through 8,000 years ago. When we saw it, we immediately thought, 'Wow, maybe that's how the first Americans came across.' And, in fact, everything we've tested seems to bear that out -- it does seem to be true.""For more than a decade, researchers have pondered a mystery within a mystery. Mitochondrial DNA indicates that migrants were isolated somewhere for up to 15,000 years on their way over from Asia to North America. The Beringian Standstill Hypothesis arises from the fact that today Native American DNA is quite different from Asian DNA, a clear indication of genetic drift of such magnitude that it can only have happened over long periods of time in nearly complete isolation from the Asian source population. The Bering Transitory Archipelago provides a suitable refugium with internal connectivity and outward isolation.Dobson said people crossing the Bering Sea probably didn't have sails but could have been experienced in paddling skin boats like the kayaks and umiaks that Inuits use today.""They probably traveled in small groups,"" he said, ""either from Asia or islands off the coast of Asia. Some maritime people are known to have existed 27,000 years ago on northern Japanese islands. They probably were maritime people -- not just living on islands, but actually practicing maritime culture, economy and travel.""Dobson recently received the American Geographical Society's Cullum Geographical Medal (the same gold medal that Neil Armstrong won for flying to the moon and Rachel Carson won for writing ""Silent Spring""). He named and continuously champions ""aquaterra"" -- all lands that were exposed and inundated repeatedly during the Late Pleistocene ice ages -- thus creating a zone of archeological promise scattered offshore from all coastal regions around the globe.Recently, Dobson and co-authors Giorgio Spada of the University of Bologna and Gaia Galassi of Urbino University ""Carlo Bo"" applied an improved Glacial Isostatic Adjustment model to nine global choke points, meaning isthmuses and straits that have funneled transport and trade throughout history. Significant human migrations are known to have occurred across some of them, including ""Beringia"" -- all portions of the Bering Sea that were exposed before, during and after the Last Glacial Maximum.""These Italian ocean scientists read my 'Aquaterra' paper and took it upon themselves to refine the boundaries of aquaterra for the whole world at coarse resolution and for Beringia itself at fine resolution,"" Dobson said. ""Later we agreed to join forces and tackle those nine global choke points. At the end of that study, we suddenly spotted these islands in the Bering Sea, and that became our focus. This had an immediate potential because it could be a real game-changer in terms of all sciences understanding how migration worked in the past. We found startling results in certain other choke points and have begun analyzing them as well.""In Beringia, the three investigators contend, this action produced a ""conveyor belt"" of islands that rose from the sea and fell back again, pushing bands of people eastward. ""The first islands to appear were just off the coast of Siberia,"" the KU researcher said. ""Then islands appeared ever eastward. Most likely migrants kept expanding eastward, too, generally to islands within view and an easy paddle away.""By 10,500 years ago, when the Bering Strait itself first appeared, almost all islands in the west had submerged. Only three islands remained, and paddling distances had increased accordingly. Thus, occupants were forced to evacuate, and they faced a clear choice: return to Asia, which they knew to be populated and may even have left due to population pressures and resource constraints, or paddle east to less known territory, perhaps less populated islands with ample resources.To fully confirm the idea set forth in the new paper, Dobson said researchers from many fields will need to collaborate as one geographer and two ocean scientists have done here.""We ourselves are at a stage where we definitely need underwater confirmation,"" he said. ""No doubt underwater archaeologists by title will prevail in that quest, but other disciplines, specialties and fields are essential. Working together plus scouring diverse literature, we presented a fundamentally new physical geography for scientists to contemplate. That should entice every relevant discipline to question conventional theory and explore new ideas regarding how, when and where people came to North America. More broadly, aquaterra can serve as a unifying theme for understanding human migrations, demic expansions, evolutionary biology, culture, settlement and endless other topics.""",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study conducted by the University of Kansas, in collaboration with Italian universities, has identified a geographic feature called the Bering Transitory Archipelago.

But new research led by scientists at UC Irvine and Boston University, out in ","""What does greening really mean? Can we really trust it to save us from climate change?"" said Jon Wang, an Earth system scientist at UCI who the led the work alongside BU Earth & Environment professor Mark Friedl. ""A big question is: What'll happen to the carbon that's currently stored in these forests as above-ground biomass in the face of a changing climate?""The answer, it turns out, is that a lot of the carbon isn't staying stored in the plants, because as fires and timber harvests at those latitudes become more and more common as climate change makes those parts of the world hotter and drier and more arable at rates sometimes twice that seen at lower latitudes, much of the new green biomass isn't storing carbon -- it's combusting during wildfires.""What we found overall is across this whole domain over the past 31 years the carbon stocks have increased modestly,"" Wang said. ""What we estimate is that 430 million metric tons of biomass has accumulated over the last 31 years -- but across this domain it would've been nearly double if it weren't for these fires and harvests that are keeping it down.""The assumption before, Wang explained, was that greening was happening and it was going to help draw climate-warming carbon dioxide concentrations down -- but no-one knew the exact extent of that help.To test the assumption, Wang and his team combined observational data from two different satellite missions from the US Geological Survey and NASA, Landsat and ICESat, so they could model the amount of carbon stored in biomass across a 2.8-million-square-kilometer region spanning Canada and Alaska.ICESat data provides measurements of the height of forest canopies, while Landsat data extends back 31 years to 1984 and provides data on the reflection of different wavelengths of light from the surface of the planet -- which also provides information about plant biomass abundance. Juxtaposing that with a two-to-three times increase in the severity of wildfires in the region, and the pictures started to take shape.Wang found that plant biomass still increased, but not as much as previous computer models that aim to simulate climate change suggested they would, as those models have struggled to account for fires as a variable. The results, Wang hopes, will help scientists who construct those models -- models that tell the world what we can expect climate change to look like -- build ever-more-accurate pictures of what's in store as the century unfolds.Co-author James Randerson from UC Irvine believes these new data are important because they provide an independent means to test climate models, and because of the way they represent feedbacks between the carbon cycle and the climate system. ""The rates of carbon accumulation in this region are lower that what previous studies have indicated, and will push the science community to look elsewhere for the main drivers of the terrestrial carbon sink,"" Randerson said.Wang added: ""The change is good news for climate -- but it's also much lower than we might've expected, because these fires have raged, and gotten more severe.""",Climate,2021.0,"A study led by Earth system scientists at the University of California, Irvine and Boston University raises questions about the effectiveness of greening initiatives in mitigating climate change.

It may sound intuitive that an ice age represents a frozen planet, but the truth is often more nuanced than that.","An ice age has constant glaciations and deglaciations, with ice sheets pulsating with the rhythm of changing climate. These giants have been consistently waxing and waning, exerting, and lifting pressure from the ocean floor.Several studies also show that the most recent deglaciation, Holocene (approximately 21ka-15ka ago) of the Barents Sea has had a huge impact on the release of methane into the water. A most recent study in ""In our study, we expand the geological history of past Arctic methane release to the next to last interglacial, the so-called Eemian period. We have found that the similarities between the events of both Holocene and Eemian deglaciation advocate for a common driver for the episodic release of geological methane -- the retreat of ice sheets."" says researcher Pierre-Antoine Dessandier, who conducted this study as a postdoctoral fellow at CAGE Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate Environment and Climate at UiT The Arctic University of Norway.The study is based on measurements of different isotopes found in sediment cores collected from the Arctic Ocean. Isotopes are variations of chemical elements, such as carbon and oxygen, in this case. Different isotopes of the same element have different weight and interact with other chemical elements in the environment in specific ways. This means that the composition of certain isotopes is correlated to the environmental changes -- such as temperature or amount of methane in the water column or within the sediment. Isotopes are taken up and stored in the shells of tiny organisms called foraminifera and in that way get archived in the sediments for thousands of years as the tiny creatures die. Also, if methane was released for longer periods of time, the archived shells get an overgrowth of carbonate which in itself also can be tested for isotopes.""The isotopic record showed that as the ice sheet melted and pressure on the seafloor lessened during the Eemian, methane was released in violent spurts, slow seeps, or a combination of both. By the time the ice disappeared completely, some thousands of years later, methane emissions had stabilized."" says Dessandier.Arctic methane reservoirs consist of gas hydrates and free gas. Gas hydrates are solids, usually methane gas, frozen in a cage with water, and extremely susceptible to pressure and temperature changes in the ocean. These reservoirs are potentially large enough to raise atmospheric methane concentrations if released during the melting of glacial ice and permafrost. The ""The present-day acceleration of Greenlands ice melt is an analogue to our model. We believe that the future release of methane from below and nearby these ice sheets is likely."" Says DessandierIncreasing methane emissions are a major contributor to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere, and are responsible for up to one-third of near-term global heating. During 2019, about 60% (360 million tons) of methane released globally was from human activities, while natural sources contributed about 40% (230 million tons).How much methane eventually made it to the atmosphere during the Eemian and Holocene deglaciations remains uncertain. Part of the problem in quantifying this are the microbial communities that live on the seafloor and in the water and use methane to survive.But both those past deglaciations happened over thousands of years, while the current retreat of the ice sheets is unprecedentedly rapid according to the geological record.""The projections of future climate change should definitely include the release of methane following in the wake of diminishing ice sheets. Past can be used to better inform the future.""",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study conducted by researchers at CAGE Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate Environment and Climate suggests a common driver for the episodic release of geological methane in the Arctic during deglaciation periods.

13,29-Apr-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/04/210429095154.htm,Global glacier retreat has accelerated,An international research team including scientists from ETH Zurich has shown that almost all the world's glaciers are becoming thinner and losing mass' and that these changes are picking up pace. The team's analysis is the most comprehensive and accurate of its kind to date.,"Glaciers are a sensitive indicator of climate change -- and one that can be easily observed. Regardless of altitude or latitude, glaciers have been melting at a high rate since the mid-20th century. Until now, however, the full extent of ice loss has only been partially measured and understood. Now an international research team led by ETH Zurich and the University of Toulouse has authored a comprehensive study on global glacier retreat, which was published online in Nature on 28 April. This is the first study to include all the world's glaciers -- around 220,000 in total -- excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The study's spatial and temporal resolution is unprecedented -- and shows how rapidly glaciers have lost thickness and mass over the past two decades.Rising sea levels and water scarcity What was once permanent ice has declined in volume almost everywhere around the globe. Between 2000 and 2019, the world's glaciers lost a total of 267 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of ice per year on average -- an amount that could have submerged the entire surface area of Switzerland under six metres of water every year. The loss of glacial mass also accelerated sharply during this period. Between 2000 and 2004, glaciers lost 227 gigatonnes of ice per year, but between 2015 and 2019, the lost mass amounted to 298 gigatonnes annually. Glacial melt caused up to 21 percent of the observed rise in sea levels during this period -- some 0.74 millimetres a year. Nearly half of the rise in sea levels is attributable to the thermal expansion of water as it heats up, with meltwaters from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and changes in terrestrial water storage accounting for the remaining third.Among the fastest melting glaciers are those in Alaska, Iceland and the Alps. The situation is also having a profound effect on mountain glaciers in the Pamir mountains, the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas. ""The situation in the Himalayas is particularly worrying,"" explains Romain Hugonnet, lead author of the study and researcher at ETH Zurich and the University of Toulouse. ""During the dry season, glacial meltwater is an important source that feeds major waterways such as the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Indus rivers. Right now, this increased melting acts as a buffer for people living in the region, but if Himalayan glacier shrinkage keeps accelerating, populous countries like India and Bangladesh could face water or food shortages in a few decades."" The findings of this study can improve hydrological models and be used to make more accurate predictions on a global and local scales -- for instance, to estimate how much Himalayan glacier meltwater one can anticipate over the next few decades.To their surprise, the researchers also identified areas where melt rates slowed between 2000 and 2019, such as on Greenland's east coast and in Iceland and Scandinavia. They attribute this divergent pattern to a weather anomaly in the North Atlantic that caused higher precipitation and lower temperatures between 2010 and 2019, thereby slowing ice loss. The researchers also discovered that the phenomenon known as the Karakoram anomaly is disappearing. Prior to 2010, glaciers in the Karakoram mountain range were stable -- and in some cases, even growing. However, the researchers' analysis revealed that Karakoram glaciers are now losing mass as well.Study based on stereo satellite images As a basis for the study, the research team used imagery captured on board NASA's Terra satellite, which has been orbiting the Earth once every 100 minutes since 1999 at an altitude of nearly 700 kilometres. Terra is home to ASTER, a multispectral imager with two cameras that record pairs of stereo images, allowing researchers to create high-resolution digital elevation models of all the world's glaciers. The team used the full archive of ASTER images to reconstruct a time series of glacial elevation, which enabled them to calculate changes in the thickness and mass of the ice over time.Lead author Romain Hugonnet is a doctoral student at ETH Zurich and the University of Toulouse. He worked on this project for nearly three years and spent 18 months analysing the satellite data. To process the data, the researchers used a supercomputer at the University of Northern British Columbia. Their findings will be included in the next Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is due to be published later this year. ""Our findings are important on a political level. The world really needs to act now to prevent the worst-case climate change scenario,"" says co-author Daniel Farinotti, head of the glaciology group at ETH Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL.Alongside the University of Toulouse, ETH Zurich and WSL, other institutions that participated in the study include Ulster University in the UK, the University of Oslo in Norway and the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada.",Climate,2021.0,"A comprehensive study led by ETH Zurich and the University of Toulouse reveals the extent of global glacier retreat.

The international team of 22 scientists, including biologists, evolutionary statisticians, and anthropologists, compared the brain mass of 1400 living and extinct mammals. For the 107 fossils examined -- among them ancient whales and the oldest Old World monkey skull ever found -- they used endocranial volume data from skulls instead of brain mass data. The brain measurements were then analyzed along with body size to compare the scale of brain size to body size over deep evolutionary time.","The findings, published in The authors say that these complex patterns urge a re-evaluation of the deeply rooted paradigm that comparing brain size to body size for any species provides a measure of the species' intelligence. ""At first sight, the importance of taking the evolutionary trajectory of body size into account may seem unimportant,"" says Jeroen Smaers, an evolutionary biologist at Stony Brook University and first author on the study. ""After all, many of the big-brained mammals such as elephants, dolphins, and great apes also have a high brain-to-body size. But this is not always the case. The California sea lion, for example, has a low relative brain size, which lies in contrast to their remarkable intelligence.""By taking into account evolutionary history, the current study reveals that the California sea lion attained a low brain-to-body size because of the strong selective pressures on body size, most likely because aquatic carnivorans diversified into a semi-aquatic niche. In other words, they have a low relative brain size because of selection on increased body size, not because of selection on decreased brain size.""We've overturned a long-standing dogma that relative brain size can be equivocated with intelligence,"" says Kamran Safi, a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and senior author on the study. ""Sometimes, relatively big brains can be the end result of a gradual decrease in body size to suit a new habitat or way of moving -- in other words, nothing to do with intelligence at all. Using relative brain size as a proxy for cognitive capacity must be set against an animal's evolutionary history and the nuances in the way brain and body have changed over the tree of life.""The study further showed that most changes in brain size occurred after two cataclysmic events in Earth's history: the mass extinction 66 million years ago and a climatic transition 23-33 million years ago.After the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period, the researchers noticed a dramatic shift in brain-body scaling in lineages such as rodents, bats and carnivorans as animals radiated into the empty niches left by extinct dinosaurs. Roughly 30 million years later, a cooling climate in the Late Paleogene led to more profound changes, with seals, bears, whales, and primates all undergoing evolutionary shifts in their brain and body size.""A big surprise was that much of the variation in relative brain size of mammals that live today can be explained by changes that their ancestral lineages underwent following these cataclysmic events,"" says Smaers. This includes evolution of the biggest mammalian brains, such as the dolphins, elephants, and great apes, which all evolved their extreme proportions after the climate change event 23-33 million years ago.The authors conclude that efforts to truly capture the evolution of intelligence will require increased effort examining neuroanatomical features, such as brain regions known for higher cognitive processes. ""Brain-to-body size is of course not independent of the evolution of intelligence,"" says Smaers.

But the researchers found that the thawings -- which expel stores of carbon dioxide sequestered deep in frozen vegetation -- were not accompanied by increased levels of COThe team of researchers explored caves in Canada to look for clues left in speleothems -- mineral deposits accumulated over thousands of years -- that might help answer when in the past did Canadian permafrost thaw and how much warmer was the climate, said Boston College Associate Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences Jeremy Shakun, a co-author of the study.The team was following up on a 2020 study that dated samples from caves in Siberia. That research found records of permafrost thawing until about 400,000 years ago, but little since then. Since the study focused on only a single region, the researchers sought to expand the search for a more representative view of the Arctic region, said Shakun, a paleoclimatologist.During the course of two years, the researchers dated 73 cave deposits from several now-frozen caves in Canada. The deposits offer tell-tale clues to climatological history because they only form when the ground is thawed and water is dripping in a cave. By dating the age of the speleothems, the scientists were able to determine when in the past the regions had thawed.Shakun said the results are very similar to the earlier Siberian study, suggesting that Arctic permafrost became more stable over the ice age cycles of the past couple million years.But he said the team was surprised to find that many of the speleothems from the high Arctic turned out to be much younger than expected. Their relatively young ages mean permafrost thawing formed mineral deposits when the world was not much warmer than it is today.Sediment cores from the Arctic Ocean hint at what might have been going on then.""The summers were ice free before 400,000 years ago,"" Shakun said. ""That would have heated the land up more during the summer and insulated it under deeper snows in the winter, causing the ground to thaw.""That theory is cause for concern if correct, he added. ""Half of the Arctic sea ice has disappeared since I was born, so this may be making the permafrost more vulnerable again.""Second, records of the ancient atmosphere show that greenhouse gas levels were not any higher during the past intervals of permafrost thaw we identified -- this is surprising because the standard view is that massive amounts of carbon should be released to the atmosphere when the permafrost thaws.Shakun said the findings call for further research to understand what allowed the permafrost to thaw at times in the past when it was not much warmer, and why there is little evidence for a big carbon release at those times.""These findings do not fit easily with typical global warming predictions for the future,"" said Shakun.

In a study published in the ","Soil microbiomes -- the collection of bacteria and other microbes in soil -- are a critical engine of the global carbon cycle; microbes decompose the dead plant material to recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem and release carbon back into the atmosphere. Multiple environmental factors influence the composition and functioning of soil microbiomes, but these responses are usually studied from an ecological perspective, asking which microbial species increase or decrease in abundance as environmental conditions change. In the current study, the UCI team investigated if bacterial species in the soil also evolve when their environment changes.""We know that evolution can occur very fast in bacteria, as in response to antibiotics, but we do not know how important evolution might be for bacteria in the environment with ongoing climate change,"" said Dr. Alex Chase, the lead author of the study and a former graduate student at UCI.Several inherent characteristics should enable soil microbes to adapt rapidly to new climate conditions. Microbes are abundant and can reproduce in only hours, so a rare genetic mutation that allows for adaptation to new climate conditions might occur by chance over a short time frame. However, most of what is known about bacterial evolution is from controlled laboratory experiments, where bacteria are grown in flasks with artificial food. It was unclear whether evolution happens fast enough in soils to be relevant to the effects of current rates of climate change.""Current predictions about how climate change will affect microbiomes make the assumption that microbial species are static. We therefore wanted to test whether bacteria can evolve rapidly in natural settings such as soil,"" explained Dr. Chase.To measure evolution in a natural environment, the researchers deployed a first-ever bacterial evolution experiment in the field, using a soil bacterium called Curtobacterium. The researchers used 125 ""microbial cages"" filled with microbial food made up of dead plant material. (The cages allow the transport of water, but not other microbes.) The cages then exposed the bacteria to a range of climate conditions across an elevation gradient in Southern California. The team conducted two parallel experiments over 18 months measuring both the ecological and evolutionary responses in the bacteria.""The microbial cages allowed us to control the types of bacteria that were present, while exposing them to different environmental conditions in different sites. We could then test, for instance, how the warm and arid conditions of the desert site affected the genetic diversity of a single Curtobacterium species,"" said Dr. Chase.After 18 months, the scientists sequenced bacterial DNA from the microbial cages of the experiments. In the first experiment containing a diverse soil microbiome, different Curtobacterium species changed in abundance, an expected ecological response.

""We have listed six areas, including curbing population growth in the context of social justice, as a framework for action.""Since 1997, there have been more than 200 articles published in Nature and Science on climate mitigation, but just four of those discussed social justice, and only two considered population,"" he added. ""Clearly social justice and population policy are not getting the attention they deserve in the struggle against the climate emergency.""The Earth's 7.7 billion people contribute to climate change in a variety of ways, primarily through the consumption of natural resources, including non-renewable energy sources, and the greenhouse gas emissions that result from industrial processes and transportation. The more people there are on the planet, the more potential they have for affecting climate.Partly due to forced sterilization campaigns and China's one-child policy, population policies have long been viewed as a taboo topic and detrimental to social justice, Wolf says, but they can be just the opposite when developed and implemented appropriately with the goal of promoting human rights, equity and social justice.""There are strong links between high rates of population growth and ecosystem impacts in developing countries connected to water and food security,"" he said. ""Given the challenges of food and water security, effective population policies can support achieving both social justice and climate adaptation, particularly when you consider the current and projected uneven geographical distribution of the impacts of climate change. Policies that address health and education can greatly reduce fertility rates.""Examples of badly needed population policy measures include improving education for girls and young women, ending child marriage and increasing the availability of voluntary, rights-based family planning services that empower all people and particularly poor women, the researchers say.""Three examples of countries in which improved education for girls and young women may have contributed to significant fertility rate declines are Ethiopia, Indonesia and Kenya,"" Ripple says. ""Among those nations, specific education reforms included instituting classes in local languages, increasing budgets for education and removing fees for attending school. Ethiopia also implemented a school lunch program, large-scale school construction took place in Indonesia, and primary school was lengthened by one year in Kenya.""As part of an overall climate justice initiative, the scientists say, rich countries should do more to help fund voluntary family planning and educational opportunities for girls and young women in developing nations.""It's not a balanced approach to focus on fertility rates without remembering that wealthy governments, corporations and individuals have been the primary contributors to carbon dioxide emissions and the main beneficiaries of fossil fuel consumption,"" Wolf said, noting the richest half of the world's population is responsible for 90% of the CO2 emissions.""From both climate and social justice perspectives, affluent overconsumption by the wealthy must be addressed immediately, for example through policies like eco-taxes such as carbon pricing,"" Ripple added. ""Reducing fertility rates alone is clearly not enough. The middle class and rich must be responsible for most of the needed reduction in emissions.""Taking steps to stabilize and then gradually reduce total human numbers within a socially just framework enhances human rights and reduces the further ordeals of migration, displacement and conflict expected in this century, Wolf and Ripple say. One potential framework is contraction and convergence, which calls for simultaneously reducing net emissions (contraction) while equalizing per capita emissions (convergence). This is equitable in the sense that it entails equalizing per capita emissions globally, a stark contrast to current patterns.""Social justice and the climate emergency demand that equitable population policies be prioritized in parallel with strategies involving energy, food, nature, short-lived pollutants and the economy,"" Ripple said.

However, little research has been done on them so far. Geographers at the South Asia Institute of Heidelberg University have now examined the spreading of aufeis and, for the first time, created a full inventory of these aufeis fields. The more than 3,700 accumulations of laminated ice are important for these high mountain areas between South and Central Asia, particularly with respect to hydrology and climatology.","In the semi-arid Himalaya regions of India and Pakistan, meltwater from snow and glaciers plays an essential role for irrigation in local agriculture and hydropower generation. In this context, aufeis has been given little attention. It appears as thin sheet-like layers of ice that form through successive freezing of water and can be several meters thick. This phenomenon occurs on a seasonal basis below springsheds, along rivulets or streams under conditions of frequent freeze-thaw cycles. ""In individual cases, this process is deliberately fostered through the construction of stone walls. These artificial reservoirs are used in some valleys of Upper Indus tributaries as water harvesting measures to bridge the seasonal water shortage in spring. However, the amount of ice, size and number of natural aufeis fields have been unknown so far,"" underlines Prof. Dr Marcus Nüsser from the South Asia Institute of Heidelberg University.The Heidelberg geographers have now compiled an inventory of these fields for the whole Upper Indus Basin and, in this context, also analysed the role of topographical parameters such as altitude and slope. The basis were several field campaigns spent in the region along with the evaluation of almost 8,300 Landsat satellite images taken between 2010 and 2020. With this imagery, the scientists were able to record the characteristic seasonal formation of aufeis and map the annually recurring bodies of ice. They detected over 3,700 aufeis fields, covering a total area of approximately 300 square kilometers. The majority of the aufeis fields lie in the Trans-Himalaya of Ladakh and on the Tibetan Plateau. In contrast, they hardly occur at all in the western part of the Upper Indus region, Marcus Nüsser explains.The study is part of a project funded by the German Research Foundation about the significance of aufeis and ice reservoirs for the population and agriculture in the Indian region of Ladakh. The participating scientists are studying the effectiveness of the different types of ice reservoirs and whether they function efficiently on a seasonal basis. ""Climate change alters both the melt rate and the annual timing of runoff, which causes increasing uncertainties for irrigated agriculture,"" emphasises Prof. Nüsser.

She found that seven had methane emissions of as much as 132 grams per hour. The average rate was 6.2 grams per hour.""Some of them were leaking a lot. Most of them were leaking a little or not at all, which is a pattern that we have seen across the oil and gas supply chain,"" Townsend-Small said. ""A few sources are responsible for most of the leaks.""The study, published in the journal ""Nobody has ever gotten access to these wells in Texas,"" Townsend-Small said. ""In my previous studies, the wells were all on public land.""A 2016 study by Townsend-Small found a similar issue in inactive wells she tested in Colorado, Wyoming, Ohio and Utah. Spread across the estimated 3.1 million abandoned wells, the leaking methane is equivalent to burning more than 16 million barrels of oil, according to government estimates.Five of the inactive wells Townsend-Small studied in Texas were leaking a brine solution onto the ground, in some cases creating large ponds.""I was horrified by that. I've never seen anything like that here in Ohio,"" Townsend-Small said. ""One was gushing out so much water that people who lived there called it a lake, but it's toxic. It has dead trees all around it and smells like hydrogen sulfide.""Most of the wells had been inactive for three to five years, possibly because of fluctuations in market demand. Inactive wells could be a substantial source of methane emissions if they are not subject to leak detection and repair regulations, the UC study concluded.The study was funded in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of the Interior.Previous studies have found the basin generates 2.7 billion kilograms of methane per year or nearly 4% of the total gas extracted. That's 60% higher than the average methane emissions in oil and gas production regions nationally. This was attributed to high rates of venting and flaring due to a lack of natural gas pipelines and other gas production infrastructure.Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that scientists have linked to climate change. If the rate of methane leaks UC observed were consistent across all 102,000 idled wells in Texas, the 5.5 million kilograms of methane released would be equivalent to burning 150 million pounds of coal each year, according to an estimate by the magazine Grist and nonprofit news organization the Texas Observer.Townsend-Small and her UC undergraduate research assistant Jacob Hoschouer, a study co-author, came to Texas at the suggestion of the media organizations, which wanted to explore the environmental impact of oil wells, particularly those that are inactive or abandoned. An expert on methane emissions, Townsend-Small has studied releases from oil and natural gas wells across the country.The journalists arranged with the property owners for Townsend-Small to examine the wells.President Joe Biden's administration has pledged $16 billion in its infrastructure plan to cap abandoned oil and gas wells and mitigate abandoned mines. Hoschouer said it would be gratifying if their research could help regulators prioritize wells for capping.In the meantime, regular inspections of inactive wells using infrared cameras to identify leaks could address the problem, the UC study suggested.",Climate,2021.0,"A study conducted by Amy Townsend-Small, an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati, examined methane emissions from 37 wells in the Permian Basin of Texas, the world's largest oil production region.

The report says the VOCs currently being used in aerosols are less damaging than the ozone-depleting CFCs they replaced in the 1980's. However, in the 80's when key international policy decisions were made, no-one foresaw such a large rise in global consumption.In the presence of sunlight, VOCs combine with a second pollutant, nitrogen oxides, to cause photochemical smog which is harmful to human health and damages crops and plants.In the 1990s and 2000s by far the largest source of VOC pollution in the UK was gasoline cars and fuel, but these emissions have reduced dramatically in recent years through controls such as catalytic converters on vehicles and fuel vapour recovery at filling stations.Researchers found that on average in high-income countries 10 cans of aerosol are used per person per year with the largest contributor being personal care products. The global amount emitted from aerosols every year is surging as lower and middle-income economies grow and people in these countries buy more.The report authors are calling on international policymakers to reduce the use of VOCs in compressed aerosols, either by encouraging less damaging propellants like nitrogen, or advocating the use of non-aerosol versions of products. At present VOCs are used in around 93 per cent of aerosol cans.Professor Alastair Lewis from the Department of Chemistry and a Director of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science said: ""Virtually all aerosol based consumer products can be delivered in non-aerosol form, for example as dry or roll-on deodorants, bars of polish not spray. Making just small changes in what we buy could have a major impact on both outdoor and indoor air quality, and have relatively little impact on our lives.""The widespread switching of aerosol propellant with non-VOC alternatives would lead to potentially meaningful reductions in surface ozone.""Given the contribution of VOCs to ground-level pollution, international policy revision is required and the continued support of VOCs as a preferred replacement for halocarbons is potentially not sustainable for aerosol products longer term.""The report says there are already non-aerosol alternatives that can be easily be applied in their liquid or solid forms, for example, as roll-on deodorant, hair gel, solid furniture polish, bronzing lotion, and room fragrance.Study authors conclude that the continued use of aerosols when non-aerosol alternatives exist is often down to the continuation of past consumer habits. And that the role played by aerosol VOC emissions in air pollution needs to be much more clearly articulated in messaging on air pollution and its management to the public.Professor Lewis added: ""Labelling of consumer products as high VOC emitting -- and clearly linking this to poor indoor and outdoor air quality -- may drive change away from aerosols to their alternatives, as has been seen previously with the successful labelling of paints and varnishes.""Amber Yeoman, a PhD student from the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories was a co-author of the study which used data from industry and regulatory bodies from around the world.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study conducted by the University of York and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science reveals that the global use of disposable aerosols has reached alarming levels, with over 25 billion cans being used annually.

Over a period of 20 years, a research team led by Professor Dr Hartmut Arndt at the Institute of Zoology has compiled a body of data that for the first time allows for a comparison of the diversity of existing eukaryotes -- organisms with a cell nucleus. Sediment samples from depths of 4000 to 8350 meters, the cultivation and sequencing of populations found exclusively in the deep sea, and finally molecular analysis using high-throughput techniques are yielding a comprehensive picture of biodiversity in the deep sea. The research results have been published in ","The deep-sea floor at water depths of more than 1000 metres covers more than 60 per cent of the Earth's surface, making it the largest part of the biosphere. Yet little is known about the diversity, distribution patterns, and functional importance of organisms in this extreme and gigantic habitat. What is certain is that climate change -- e.g. through warming, acidification, or oxygen depletion -- is already having an impact on this sensitive ecosystem. In addition, the deep sea is under pressure from the growing interest in raw material extraction.Scientists previously assumed that deep-sea basins, which are all characterized by the same low temperature (0-4°C), salinity (about 3.6 per cent), high pressure (300-500bar depending on depth), and very similar sediment, have relatively low -- and also the same -- species diversity. Moreover, most deep-sea studies to date have focused on specific habitats such as hydrothermal vents and saltwater lenses. Until now, there has been a lack of data on the diversity of deep-sea plains, which make up by far the largest portion of the seafloor. 'By using a new approach of combined molecular biology and cultivation-based studies, we found substantial, highly specific local differences in organism communities with little overlap to the organism communities of coastal regions,' said Dr Alexandra Schönle, lead author of the study.Among the life forms, unicellular organisms (protists), which have been mostly overlooked in current deep-sea food web models, dominated. In addition to the calcareous chambered organisms (foraminifera) traditionally considered in studies, whose deposits dominate vast areas of the world ocean, tiny naked protists dominated, including bacterivorous and parasitic flagellates and ciliates, whose diversity significantly exceeded that of multicellular animals. Also surprising was the high proportion of parasitic forms (10 to 20 per cent), which was previously unknown on this scale. Many of them are likely to infect animals such as crustaceans or fish, but others are likely to infect protozoa.'Our results show that organic matter on the deep-sea floor is recycled through different and previously insufficiently considered components of the microbial food web, and then passed on in the food web. This is crucial for our understanding of global carbon flux,' explains Professor Dr Hartmut Arndt. 'Given the significant differences in the biodiversity of the individual deep-sea basins and their importance in the global context, the economic exploitation and foreseeable devastation of individual deep-sea basins and the sparing of other deep-sea basins seems absurd.'",Climate,2021.0,"The deep-sea floor, covering over 60% of Earth's surface, is the largest part of the biosphere, but remains poorly understood.

In a new study a team of researchers from Potsdam, Germany has quantified the substantial shifts Europe's electricity system is about to undergo when the newly decided EU climate target gets implemented. Higher carbon prices, the authors show, are not only an inevitable step to cut emissions -- they will also lead much faster to an inexpensive electricity system powered by renewable energies.","""Once the EU translates their recently adjusted target of cutting emissions by at least 55% in 2030 in comparison to 1990 into tighter EU ETS caps, the electricity sector will see fundamental changes surprisingly soon,"" says Robert Pietzcker from the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), one of the lead authors. ""In our computer simulations of the new ambitious targets, this would mean that renewables would contribute almost three fourths of the power generation already in 2030 and we would reach zero emissions in the power sector as soon as by 2040. Once the change is initiated, it can gain speed in an unprecedented way.""In order to determine the impacts, the economists studied variations of the emissions reduction targets, increased electricity demand, which might arise from sector coupling, and investments in building an effective transmission grid infrastructure to better pool renewable resources across the European countries. They also analysed the effect of potential unavailability of new nuclear power deployment and carbon capture and storage (CCS) power plants designed to reduce the amount of human-made emissions of CO""All things considered, the 55% target will have massive consequences for the power sector,"" says Sebastian Osorio from PIK, another lead author.

That's partially, he explains, because the definition of ""high altitude"" does not have a fixed cut-off.Using novel techniques, Dr. Tremblay's publication in the Dr. Trembly says an important part of his study was presenting population data at 500-metre intervals. And while he says the 81 million is a staggering number, it is also important to note that by going to 1,500 metres that number jumps to more than 500 million.""To understand the impact of life at high altitude on human physiology, adaption, health and disease, it is imperative to know how many people live at high altitude and where they live,"" says Dr. Tremblay.Earlier research relied on calculating percentages of inconsistent population data and specific country-level data that has been unavailable. To address this, Dr. Tremblay combined geo-referenced population and elevation data to create global and country-level estimates of humans living at high altitude.""The majority of high-altitude research is based upon lowlanders from western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries who ascend to high altitude to conduct their research,"" says Dr. Tremblay. ""Yet, there are populations who have successfully lived at high altitudes for thousands of years and who are facing increasing pressures.""Living at high altitude presents major stressors to human physiology, he explains. For example, low air pressure at high altitude makes it more difficult for oxygen to enter a person's vascular systems.""When low-landers travel to high altitudes our bodies develop inefficient physiological responses, which we know as altitude sickness,"" he says. ""However, the people we studied have acquired the ability to thrive at extremely high altitudes. Their experiences can inform the diagnosis and treatment of disease for all humans, while also helping us understand how to enhance the health and well-being of high-altitude populations.""With only a fraction of the world's high-altitude residents being studied, the understanding of the location and size of populations is a critical step towards understanding the differences arising from life at high altitude.Dr. Tremblay notes it's not just a case of understanding how these populations have survived for generations, but also how they thrive living in such extreme conditions. Especially as climate change continues to impact, not only the air they breathe, but every aspect of their daily lives.""We tend to think of climate change as a problem for low-altitude, coastal populations, but melting snow, glaciers and extreme weather events limit water and agriculture resources,"" he explains.

""But societies that are riven by internal social dynamics of any sort -- which could be wealth differences, racial disparities or other divisions -- are fragile because of those factors. Then climate challenges can easily become very serious.""Archeologists have long speculated about the causes of occasional upheavals in the pre-Spanish societies created by the ancestors of contemporary Pueblo peoples. These Ancestral Pueblo communities once occupied the Four Corners area of the U.S. from 500 to 1300 where today Colorado borders Utah, Arizona and New Mexico.While these communities were often stable for many decades, they experienced several disruptive social transformations before leaving the area in the late 1200s. When more precise measurements indicated that droughts coincided with these transformations, many archeologists decided that these climate challenges were their primary cause.In this study, Kohler collaborated with complexity scientists from Wageningen University in The Netherlands, led by Marten Scheffer, who have shown that loss of resilience in a system approaching a tipping point can be detected through subtle changes in fluctuation patterns.""Those warning signals turn out to be strikingly universal,"" said Scheffer, first author on the study. ""They are based on the fact that slowing down of recovery from small perturbations signals loss of resilience.""Other research has found signs of such ""critical slowing down"" in systems as diverse as the human brain, tropical rainforests and ice caps as they approach critical transitions.""When we saw the amazingly detailed data assembled by Kohler's team, we thought this would be the ideal case to see if our indicators might detect when societies become unstable -- something quite relevant in the current social context,"" Scheffer said.The research used tree-ring analyses of wood beams used for construction, which provided a time series of estimated tree-cutting activity spanning many centuries.""This record is like a social thermometer,"" said Kohler, who is also affiliated with the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in Colorado and the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. ""Tree cutting and construction are vital components of these societies. Any deviation from normal tells you something is going on.""They found that weakened recovery from interruptions in construction activity preceded three major transformations of Pueblo societies. These slow-downs were different than other interruptions, which showed quick returns to normal in the following years. The archeologists also noted increased signs of violence at the same time, confirming that tension had likely increased and that societies were nearing a tipping point.This happened at the end of the period known as the Basketmaker III, around the year 700, as well as near the ends of the periods called Pueblo I and Pueblo II, around 900 and 1140 respectively. Near the end of each period, there was also evidence of drought. The findings indicate that it was the two factors together -- social fragility and drought -- that spelled trouble for these societies.Social fragility was not at play, however, at the end of the Pueblo III period in the late 1200s when Pueblo farmers left the Four Corners with most moving far south. This study supports the theory that it was a combination of drought and conflict with outside groups that spurred the Pueblo peoples to leave.Kohler said we can still learn from what happens when climate challenges and social problems coincide.""Today we face multiple social problems including rising wealth inequality along with deep political and racial divisions, just as climate change is no longer theoretical,"" Kohler said. ""If we're not ready to face the challenges of changing climate as a cohesive society, there will be real trouble.""",Climate,2021.0,"Archaeologists studying pre-Spanish Pueblo societies have found evidence suggesting that social tension played a significant role in their dramatic upheavals, alongside drought.

About half the harvest -- stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs -- remains as waste after the kernels have been stripped from the cobs. These leftovers, known as corn stover, have few commercial or industrial uses aside from burning. A new paper by engineers at UC Riverside describes an energy-efficient way to put corn stover back into the economy by transforming it into activated carbon for use in water treatment.","Activated carbon, also called activated charcoal, is charred biological material that has been treated to create millions of microscopic pores that increase how much the material can absorb.

When the researchers filtered water into which vanillin had been added through the activated carbon, its combination of larger surface area and bigger pores enabled the carbon to absorb more vanillin.""Finding applications for idle resources such as corn stover is imperative to combat climate change.

However, a new study, involving University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Associate Professor of Microbiology Karen Lloyd, unveils a large microbial ecosystem living deep within the earth that is fueled by chemicals produced during these tectonic cataclysms.","When oceanic and continental plates collide, one plate is pushed down, or subducted, into the mantle and the other plate is pushed up and studded with volcanoes. This is the main process by which chemical elements are moved between Earth's surface and interior and eventually recycled back to the surface.""Subduction zones are fascinating environments -- they produce volcanic mountains and serve as portals for carbon moving between the interior and exterior of Earth,"" said Maarten de Moor, associate professor at the National University of Costa Rica and coauthor of the study.Normally this process is thought to occur outside the reach of life because of the extremely high pressures and temperatures involved. Although life almost certainly does not exist at the extreme conditions where Earth's mantle mixes with the crust to form lava, in recent decades scientists have learned that microbes extend far deeper into Earth's crust than previously thought.This opens the possibility for discovering previously unknown types of biological interactions occurring with deep plate tectonic processes.An interdisciplinary and international team of scientists has shown that a vast microbial ecosystem primarily eats the carbon, sulfur, and iron chemicals produced during the subduction of the oceanic plate beneath Costa Rica. The team obtained these results by sampling the deep subsurface microbial communities that are brought to the surface in natural hot springs, in work funded by the Deep Carbon Observatory and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.The team found that this microbial ecosystem sequesters a large amount of carbon produced during subduction that would otherwise escape to the atmosphere. The process results in an estimated decrease of up to 22 percent in the amount of carbon being transported to the mantle.""This work shows that carbon may be siphoned off to feed a large ecosystem that exists largely without input from the sun's energy. This means that biology might affect carbon fluxes in and out of the earth's mantle, which forces scientists to change how they think about the deep carbon cycle over geologic time scales,"" said Peter Barry, assistant scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and a coauthor of the study.The team found that these microbes -- called chemolithoautotrophs -- sequester so much carbon because of their unique diet, which allows them to make energy without sunlight.""Chemolithoautotrophs are microbes that use chemical energy to build their bodies. So they're like trees, but instead of using sunlight they use chemicals,"" said Lloyd, a co-corresponding author of the study. ""These microbes use chemicals from the subduction zone to form the base of an ecosystem that is large and filled with diverse primary and secondary producers.

A new Johns Hopkins University study finds stories to be significantly more motivating than scientific facts -- at least for some people.","After hearing a compelling pollution-related story in which a man died, the average person paid more for green products than after having heard scientific facts about water pollution. But the average person in the study was a Democrat. Republicans paid less after hearing the story rather than the simple facts.The findings, published this week in the journal ""Our findings suggest the power of storytelling may be more like preaching to the choir,"" said co-author Paul J. Ferraro, an evidence-based environmental policy expert and the Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Human Behavior and Public Policy at Johns Hopkins.""For those who are not already leaning toward environmental action, stories might actually make things worse.""Scientists have little scientific evidence to guide them on how best to communicate with the public about environmental threats. Increasingly, scientists have been encouraged to leave their factual comfort zones and tell more stories that connect with people personally and emotionally. But scientists are reluctant to tell such stories because, for example, no one can point to a deadly flood or a forest fire and conclusively say that the deaths were caused by climate change.The question researchers hoped to answer with this study: Does storytelling really work to change people's behavior? And if so, for whom does it work best?""We said let's do a horserace between a story and a more typical science-based message and see what actually matters for purchasing behavior,"" Ferraro said.Researchers conducted a field experiment involving just over 1,200 people at an agricultural event in Delaware. Everyone surveyed had lawns or gardens and lived in watershed known to be polluted.Through a random-price auction, researchers attempted to measure how much participants were willing to pay for products that reduce nutrient pollution. Before people could buy the products, they watched a video with either scientific facts or story about nutrient pollution.In the story group, participants viewed a true story about a local man's death that had plausible but tenuous connections to nutrient pollution: he died after eating contaminated shellfish. In the scientific facts group, participants viewed an evidence-based description of the impacts of nutrient pollution on ecosystems and surrounding communities.After watching the videos, all participants had a chance to purchase products costing less than $10 that could reduce storm water runoff: fertilizer, soil test kits, biochar and soaker hoses.People who heard the story were on average willing to pay more than those who heard the straight science. But the results skewed greatly when broken down by political party. The story made liberals 17 percent more willing to buy the products, while making conservatives want to spend 14 percent less.The deep behavioral divide along party lines surprised Ferraro, who typically sees little difference in behavior between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to matters such as energy conservation.""We hope this study stimulates more work about how to communicate the urgency of climate change and other global environmental challenges,"" said lead author Hilary Byerly, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Colorado.

""Improving how we communicate about flooding is an important step in the right direction.""In some states, such as Florida, as many as one in six homes are in floodplains. As more people have built more homes in areas exposed to cyclones, sea-level rise and other inundation hazards, flooding damage costs have skyrocketed. Since 2000, overall flood damages have quadrupled in the U.S.More frequent extreme weather could magnify the trend. In the next 30 years, flood damages to U.S. homes are projected to rise more than 60 percent, from $20 billion to nearly $32.2 billion a year, according to nonprofit research group First Street Foundation.While some states, such as Louisiana, require detailed flood risk disclosures, others require no risk disclosures of any kind. Only two states require that sellers disclose the cost of their insurance policy -- an additional cost burden for the buyer. Most states only require disclosures by the time the contract is signed, making them unlikely to inform buyers' decisions.Unlike many past studies, which focused on single counties or cities in only a few states, the new analysis casts a nationwide net to paint a clearer picture of whether markets effectively account for publicly available information about flood risk. Hino and study senior author Marshall Burke, an associate professor of Earth system science in Stanford Earth, pored over historical and current floodplain maps as well as detailed real estate transaction data to estimate the effect of regulatory floodplain maps on property values or what the researchers call the flood zone discount.To better understand the drivers of flood zone discount, the researchers examined what happened to property values when floodplain maps were updated, causing some houses to be rezoned from outside to inside the floodplain.The analysis revealed that single-family homes zoned into a floodplain lose roughly 2% percent of their value, which works out to $10,500 for a $500,000 home or $21,000 for a $1 million home. In contrast, had buyers factored in the cost of fully insuring the floodplain home against damage, it should have pushed prices down 4.7 percent to 10.6 percent - as much as $53,000 for a $500,000 home or $106,000 for a $1 million home, according to the researchers.""We like to think that markets work efficiently and incorporate all known information about risk,"" said Burke. ""But here we find clear evidence, in an incredibly valuable market, that the market is underpricing flood risk.""Perhaps unsurprisingly, the results suggest that a buyer's flood risk awareness shapes the value they perceive in a property. This awareness is likely informed by a combination of disclosure laws and the extent of flood risk within the community measured by the percentage of homes located in floodplains. More sophisticated commercial buyers, such as corporations that rent out single-family homes, discount flood zone properties by about 5 percentage points more than other buyers.The urgency of informing homebuyers about hazards from floods and other climate change-driven hazards will only grow. This past year was the tenth in a row with eight or more billion-dollar disasters in the U.S.Policymakers can help by passing legislation that promotes access to information about the extent of past flood events and strengthens real estate disclosure requirements, according to the researchers. Broader risk communication efforts -- requiring sellers to disclose flood risks and insurance costs before buyers make offers, for example -- could help rebalance real estate markets and significantly increase buy-in for flood insurance coverage, something the National Flood Insurance Program has failed to do.""We spend a lot of time and energy trying to map climate hazards and how they are changing, and we need to make sure that people can access and understand that information when they need it,"" said Hino.The research was funded by the Sykes Family Fellowship in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.",Climate,2021.0,"A study conducted by researchers from Stanford University reveals that the U.S. housing market undervalues properties in flood-prone areas, which poses concerns given the increasing climate risks.

The work has implications for coastal populations worldwide.The new study, co-authors of which include first author Pietro De Lellis, an engineer at the University of Naples Federico II, Italy, and Manuel Ruiz Marin, a mathematician at the Technical University of Cartagena, Spain, presents a mathematical model of human migration that considers not just economic factors but also human behavior -- whether people are unwilling or unable to leave and if they later return home. It also considers the cascading effects of migration, as migrants repeatedly move to find new opportunities, and original inhabitants are displaced. The research is published in ""We are not only looking at a snapshot, but we are trying to reconstruct the trajectory of the migration and looking at its evolution,"" said Porfiri, who is also an Institute Professor of mechanical and aerospace, biomedical, and civil and urban engineering at NYU Tandon.According to the new model, the districts in the south along the Bay of Bengal will be the first to be impacted by sea-level rise, causing a migration that will ripple across the country and affect all 64 districts. Some migrants will likely be rejected by the existing residents -- or displace them -- triggering further migrations. While the population of the capital, Dhaka, initially will surge, the results suggest that movement away from the inundated capital region will ultimately cause its population to shrink.Bangladesh is especially susceptible to sea-level rise because it is a low-lying country crisscrossed with rivers, and already experiences frequent flooding during the summer monsoon season. Its coastline on the Bay of Bengal measures about 580 kilometers (360 miles), with a large portion consumed by the Ganges river delta. An estimated 41 percent of its 163 million people live at elevations lower than 10 meters (about 32 feet).The work follows upon a 2020 study by Porfiri and Ruiz Marin that examined population migrations in Bangladesh due to sea level rise as a way to verify an approach to detect spatial associations from small datasets, through the use of specific principles of information theory.The authors emphasize that the new model can be used to study migration in response to any environmental disturbance that causes unrest, such as droughts, earthquakes or wildfires. Additionally, it is relatively simple and can make reliable predictions based on little data.An earlier migration model using the same data predicted that the central region of Bangladesh, including its capital, Dhaka, would receive the greatest number of migrants. The new study agrees, but finds that the ripple effects from that migration will ultimately cause people to leave the capital, leading to a population decline.Porfiri explained that the team's approach to mathematical modeling for reliably predicting environmental migration in Bangladesh can be applied anywhere.""Droughts, desertification, floods, earthquakes, and wildfire threaten livelihood worldwide; from wealthy to developing economies, every country is vulnerable to environmental change,"" he said. ""Mathematical models can assist in providing reliable predictions of environmental migration, which are critical for devising effective policy initiatives and improving our preparedness for future migration patterns.""De Lellis added that the outputs from the model can help governments plan and prepare for the impacts of environmental disturbances by allocating resources to the most hard-hit regions and ensuring that cities are adequately equipped to deal with the influx of environmental migrants.""Mathematical modeling is the only way we have to ground our future decisions,"" said De Lellis.

It's a silly rhyme, but one that highlights a simple fact: Humans have long relied on wells -- such as the one on the hill visited by Jack and Jill -- for their primary drinking water supply.","Although the number of people who draw their water by pail is declining as pumps become ever more widespread, groundwater wells still supply drinking water to more than half of the world's population and sustain over 40% of irrigated agriculture. But this vital resource underfoot often gets overlooked.UC Santa Barbara assistant professors Debra Perrone and Scott Jasechko have compiled the most comprehensive assay of groundwater wells to date, spanning 40 countries that collectively account for half of all global groundwater pumping. Their study, the cover story of the April 23 edition of the journal ""We analyzed construction records for tens of millions of groundwater wells around the world,"" said Jasechko, of the university's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, ""and the big take home is that many wells are at risk of running dry."" Up to one in five wells in their survey, to be exact.""These groundwater wells are used to withdraw water for household use or irrigation,"" added Perrone, a faculty member in the Environmental Studies Program. ""Our study is the first time that groundwater wells and water level observations have been stitched together like this, providing local insights at the global scale.""Reaching these conclusions required the better part of six years' work by Perrone and Jasechko. The researchers culled their data from more than 100 unique databases around the world, sometimes in different formats and languages.The first step involved compiling roughly 39 million records of functional groundwater wells that included depth, purpose, location and construction date. Rather than delegate processing the data to an algorithm or AI, the researchers carefully went through tidying it up manually. ""We wanted to be sure we understood the limitations and nuances for each database we analyzed,"" Jasechko said.With the data sorted, the authors compared the depths of local water tables against well depths. They found that 6 to 20% of the wells in their global sample were at risk of running dry if water levels continue to decline by just a few meters. They sought to find trends in the depths of new wells compared to existing wells in a given area from 1950 through 2015. While newer wells tended to be deeper than older ones, the trend was not ubiquitous, they said. Functional wells were not getting substantially deeper in many of the areas they surveyed.The researchers then pulled data from roughly 1.1 million monitoring wells, which provide measurements of groundwater levels and conditions. These records supplied not only an account of where the water table lay, but also how much it fluctuated over the course of the year. Seasonal variation, they found, was typically within one meter.By comparing depth trends to measurements from nearby monitoring wells, Perrone and Jasechko could also deduce how close functional wells were to drying out. They found that in many areas groundwater levels are declining, yet new wells are not being drilled deeper to keep pace with the falling water table. Since wells aren't getting substantially deeper in many areas, newer wells are at least as vulnerable as older wells should groundwater levels continue to decline.""In some places, groundwater levels are close to the bottom of wells,"" Perrone stated. ""If groundwater levels continue to decline in these places, wells will go dry, leaving people without access to water.""The two researchers also availed themselves of data from NASA's GRACE mission. The pair of GRACE satellites detect small differences in the Earth's gravitational field as they orbit the planet. This provided Perrone and Jasechko with information about groundwater reserves for regions where data from monitoring wells is limited.""We only have groundwater level monitoring data for a few dozen countries,"" Jasechko said, ""but GRACE data allows us to explore changes in water storage around the globe."" While the resolution was coarse, the additional information confirmed the disconnect between declining groundwater and the construction of deeper wells.There are many reasons not to drill deeper. It's much more expensive in terms of drilling and operational costs. The quality of groundwater can also decrease at depth, often becoming more saline toward the bottom of an aquifer.""Drilling wells is expensive,"" Jasechko remarked. ""Even if fresh water exists deep underground, not every individual or household has the capital to drill a new well to access it, which raises concerns about equity when wells run dry.""The pair hope to expand the coverage of their dataset, especially to countries like China, Iran and Pakistan, three major users of groundwater that the researchers could not obtain records from. They also plan to investigate the extent of groundwater decline in future research, looking for information on how quickly water tables are dropping and where the trend is accelerating.Groundwater can provide a lifeline in even the most arid regions.Perrone and Jasechko have made a name for themselves in the field of groundwater research by approaching the topic with enormous datasets like this one. The global study comes on the heels of another paper published in Nature on groundwater resources across the United States. There, they revealed the extent to which rivers across the country are losing flow to aquifers, in part due to pumping.Together, the findings paint a broad picture not just of wells in danger, but of dwindling groundwater resources as a whole. While pumping may have the most direct impact on aquifers, the authors note, human activity has many indirect effects on groundwater quality and levels. Industrial activity, water diversion and even pavement and runoff affect the water beneath our feet. Climate change may exert the greatest influence over the long term, as it alters the distribution and intensity of precipitation and evapotranspiration from plants and soils worldwide.""These findings highlight the importance of groundwater resources and groundwater management to the global community,"" Perrone said. ""Putting all the data together reveals that declining groundwater levels threaten wells in many places across the world.""Groundwater sustainability is a complex issue with a lot of considerations and tradeoffs, the authors acknowledged. Deciding on a course of action won't be easy, but compiling and analyzing large datasets like this are a critical first-step in tackling the challenge. ""With these data, we can make more informed management decisions to help us use groundwater sustainably,"" Perrone said.",Climate,2021.0,"Groundwater wells supply drinking water to over half of the world's population and support 40% of irrigated agriculture, but their importance often goes unnoticed.

36,25-Apr-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/04/210425114433.htm,"Climate has shifted the axis of the Earth, study finds",Glacial melting due to global warming is likely the cause of a shift in the movement of the poles that occurred in the 1990s.,"The locations of the North and South poles aren't static, unchanging spots on our planet. The axis Earth spins around -- or more specifically the surface that invisible line emerges from -- is always moving due to processes scientists don't completely understand. The way water is distributed on Earth's surface is one factor that drives the drift.Melting glaciers redistributed enough water to cause the direction of polar wander to turn and accelerate eastward during the mid-1990s, according to a new study in ""The faster ice melting under global warming was the most likely cause of the directional change of the polar drift in the 1990s,"" said Shanshan Deng, a researcher at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an author of the new study.The Earth spins around an axis kind of like a top, explains Vincent Humphrey, a climate scientist at the University of Zurich who was not involved in this research. If the weight of a top is moved around, the spinning top would start to lean and wobble as its rotational axis changes. The same thing happens to the Earth as weight is shifted from one area to the other.Researchers have been able to determine the causes of polar drifts starting from 2002 based on data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), a joint mission by NASA and the German Aerospace Center, launched with twin satellites that year and a follow up mission in 2018. The mission gathered information on how mass is distributed around the planet by measuring uneven changes in gravity at different points.Previous studies released on the GRACE mission data revealed some of the reasons for later changes in direction. For example, research has determined more recent movements of the North Pole away from Canada and toward Russia to be caused by factors like molten iron in the Earth's outer core. Other shifts were caused in part by what's called the terrestrial water storage change, the process by which all the water on land -- including frozen water in glaciers and groundwater stored under our continents -- is being lost through melting and groundwater pumping.The authors of the new study believed that this water loss on land contributed to the shifts in the polar drift in the past two decades by changing the way mass is distributed around the world. In particular, they wanted to see if it could also explain changes that occurred in the mid-1990s.In 1995, the direction of polar drift shifted from southward to eastward. The average speed of drift from 1995 to 2020 also increased about 17 times from the average speed recorded from 1981 to 1995.Now researchers have found a way to wind modern pole tracking analysis backward in time to learn why this drift occurred. The new research calculates the total land water loss in the 1990s before the GRACE mission started.""The findings offer a clue for studying past climate-driven polar motion,"" said Suxia Liu, a hydrologist at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the corresponding author of the new study. ""The goal of this project, funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China is to explore the relationship between the water and polar motion.""Using data on glacier loss and estimations of ground water pumping, Liu and her colleagues calculated how the water stored on land changed. They found that the contributions of water loss from the polar regions is the main driver of polar drift, with contributions from water loss in nonpolar regions. Together, all this water loss explained the eastward change in polar drift.""I think it brings an interesting piece of evidence to this question,"" said Humphrey. ""It tells you how strong this mass change is -- it's so big that it can change the axis of the Earth.""Humphrey said the change to the Earth's axis isn't large enough that it would affect daily life. It could change the length of day we experience, but only by milliseconds.The faster ice melting couldn't entirely explain the shift, Deng said. While they didn't analyze this specifically, she speculated that the slight gap might be due to activities involving land water storage in non-polar regions, such as unsustainable groundwater pumping for agriculture.Humphrey said this evidence reveals how much direct human activity can have an impact on changes to the mass of water on land. Their analysis revealed large changes in water mass in areas like California, northern Texas, the region around Beijing and northern India, for example -- all areas that have been pumping large amounts of groundwater for agricultural use.""The ground water contribution is also an important one,"" Humphrey said. ""Here you have a local water management problem that is picked up by this type of analysis.""Liu said the research has larger implications for our understanding of land water storage earlier in the 20th century. Researchers have 176 years of data on polar drift.

They learned that the annual burn season has lengthened in the past two decades and that the yearly peak has shifted from August to July. The team's findings are the subject of a study published today in the open-access journal The study is a focused examination of fire frequency, burned area and myriad drivers of the catastrophically destructive events. The team found that the number of hot spots -- places with severe fire risk -- has grown significantly in recent years, fueled by higher annual mean temperatures, greater vapor pressure deficit (lack of air moisture), drought, and an elevated chance of blazes being sparked through such human causes as power line disruptions, construction, transportation, campfires, discarded cigarettes and fireworks.""CALFIRE data show that each new year of the 21st century has been a record breaker in terms of wildfire damage in California,"" said co-author Tirtha Banerjee, UCI assistant professor of civil & environmental engineering. ""We also have seen that about 80 percent of the total number of the state's wildfires over the past few decades have been small, measuring less that 500 acres. But when fires get large, their deadliness greatly increases.""Banerjee said that to gain a proper understanding of the growth of fire risk in California, it's important to put large and small incidents into separate buckets. By doing this, the team learned that 1,247 out of 6,336 wildfires, about 20 percent, accounted for 97 percent of the total burned area in the 2000 to 2020 period.""And more than nine-tenths of the casualties and property losses can be attributed to fires exceeding the 500-acre threshold,"" Banerjee said.He added that over the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in ""extreme"" wildfires scorching more that 10,000 acres. Coinciding with that has been a rapid uptick in the frequency of small, human-caused blazes.One of the most alarming findings of the study, according to lead-author Shu Li, a Ph.D. student in Banerjee's laboratory, is the substantial spatial growth of fire risk throughout the state. From 1920 to 1999, California's only hot spot with ""very high wildfire density"" was Los Angeles County. In the past 20 years, that designation has expanded greatly in Southern California to include Ventura County, and portions of Riverside, San Diego and San Bernardino Counties.Even in northern California, areas known by fire managers as the Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit and the Tuolumne-Calaveras Unit are newly emerged as high-density wildfire regions.""Before 2000, there were almost no human-caused wildfires along California's Pacific coastline, but now nearly every coastal county is experiencing increased risk, and the San Benito-Monterey Unit and the San Luis Obispo Unit have even become new hot spots,"" said Li.Many of the major fires in the northern part of the state are naturally occurring, predominantly ignited by lightning. But the majority of the increase in fire probability in recent years can be blamed on an expansion of the wilderness-urban interface. As people move into previously unpopulated areas, they bring their bad fire management habits with them.""The concurrence of human-caused climate change, which is drying out our forests and grasslands and creating longer stretches of hot weather, and a steady influx of people into remote areas is creating conditions for the perfect fire storm,"" said Banerjee. ""But there is some good news in all of this; human-caused fire risk can be mitigated by better fire management practices by humans.""He said he hoped the study and the near real-time analysis of fire risks in California's natural environment it provides can be used by government agencies and public policy officials to both prevent and combat costly blazes.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have analyzed wildfire data in California from 2000 to 2019 and compared it with data from 1920 to 1999.

To monitor and respond to these trends, scientists and policy-makers need reliable data.","Biodiversity researchers and managers often don't have the necessary information, or access to it, to tackle some of the greatest environmental challenges facing society, such as biodiversity loss or climate change. Data can be a powerful tool for the development of science and decision-making, which is where the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) comes in.ALA -- Australia's national biodiversity database -- uses cutting-edge digital tools which enable people to share, access and analyse data about local plants, animals and fungi. It brings together millions of sightings as well as environmental data like rainfall and temperature in one place to be searched and analysed. All data are made publicly available -- ALA was established in line with open-access principles and uses an open-source code base.The impressive set of databases on Australia's biodiversity includes information on species occurrence, animal tracking, specimens, biodiversity projects, and Australia's Natural History Collections. The ALA also manages a wide range of other data, including information on spatial layers, indigenous ecological knowledge, taxonomic profiles and biodiversity literature. Together with its partner tools, the ALA has radically enhanced ease of access to biodiversity data. A forum paper recently published with the open-access, peer-reviewed Established in 2010 under the Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to support the research sector with trusted biodiversity data, it now delivers data and related services to more than 80,000 users every year, helping scientists, policy makers, environmental planners, industry, and the general public to work more efficiently. It also supports the international community as the Australian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the code base for the successful international Living Atlases community.With thousands of records being added daily, the ALA currently contains nearly 95 million occurrence records of over 111,000 species, the earliest of them being from the late 1600s. Among them, 1.7 million are observation records harvested by computer algorithms, and the trend is that their share will keep growing.Recognising the potential of citizen science for contributing valuable information to Australia's biodiversity, the ALA became a member of the iNaturalist Network in 2019 and established an Australian iNaturalist node to encourage people to submit their species observations. Projects like DigiVol and BioCollect were also born from ALA's interest in empowering citizen science.The ALA BioCollect platform supports biodiversity-related projects by capturing both descriptive metadata and raw primary field data. BioCollect has a strong citizen science emphasis, with 524 citizen science projects that are open to involvement by anyone. The platform also provides information on projects related to ecoscience and natural resource management activities.Hosted by the Australian Museum, DigiVol is a volunteer portal where over 6,000 public volunteers have transcribed over 800,000 specimen labels and 124,000 pages of field notes. Harnessing the power and passion of volunteers, the tool makes more information available to science by digitising specimens, images, field notes and archives from collections all over the world.Built on a decade of partnerships with biodiversity data partners, government departments, community and citizen science organisations, the ALA provides a robust suite of services, including a range of data systems and software applications that support both the research sector and decision makers.

The vivid reds, oranges, purples and yellows she was used to seeing in the sunlit waters near the surface look increasingly dim and drab with depth, and before long the whole ocean loses most of its rainbow leaving nothing but shades of blue.","""The thing that always got me about diving was what happens to people's faces and lips,"" said her former Ph.D. adviser Sönke Johnsen, a biology professor at Duke University. ""Everybody has a ghastly sallow complexion.""Which got the researchers to thinking: In the last half-century, some fish have been shifting into deeper waters, and climate change is likely to blame. One study found that fish species off the northeastern coast of the United States descended more than one meter per year between 1968 and 2007, in response to a warming of only about one degree Celsius.Could such shifts make the color cues fish rely on for survival harder to see?Previous research suggests it might. Scientists already have evidence that fish have a harder time discerning differences in each other's hues and brightness in waters made murkier by other causes, such as erosion or nutrient runoff.As an example, the authors cite studies of three-spined sticklebacks that breed in the shallow coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, where females choose among males -- who care for the eggs -- based on the redness of their throats and bellies. But algal blooms can create cloudy conditions that make it harder to see, which tricks females into mating with less fit males whose hatchlings don't make it.The turbidity makes it harder for a male to prove he's a worthy mate by interfering with females' ability to distinguish subtle gradations of red or orange, Johnsen said. ""For any poor fish that has beautiful red coloration on his body, now it's like, 'well, you're just going to have to take my word for it.'""Other studies have shown that, for cichlid fish in Africa's Lake Victoria, where species rely on their distinctive colors to recognize their own kind, pollution can reduce water clarity to a point where they lose the ability to tell each other apart and start mating every which way.The researchers say the same communication breakdown plaguing fish in turbid waters is likely happening to species that are being pushed to greater depths. And interactions with would-be mates aren't the only situations that could be prone to confusion. Difficulty distinguishing colors could also make it harder for fish to locate prey, recognize rivals, or warn potential predators that they are dangerous to eat.In a study published April 21 in the journal They were able to show that, while the surface waters may be bursting with color, descending by just 30 meters shrinks the palette considerably.""It's like going back to the days of black and white TV,"" Johnsen said.When sunlight hits an object, some wavelengths are absorbed and others bounce off. It's the wavelengths that are reflected back that make a red fish look red, or a blue fish blue. But a fish sporting certain colors at the surface will start to look different as it swims deeper because the water filters out or absorbs some wavelengths sooner than others.The researchers were surprised to find that, especially for shallow-water species such as those that live in and around coral reefs, it doesn't take much of a downward shift to have a dramatic effect on how colors appear.""You really don't have to go very far from the surface to notice a big impact,"" said Caves, who will be starting as an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, this fall.Precisely which colors lose their luster first, and how quickly that happens as you go down, depends on what depths a species typically inhabits and how much deeper they are forced to go, as well as the type of environment they live in -- whether it's, say, the shallow bays or rocky shores of the Atlantic, or a tropical coral reef.In clear ocean water, red is the first color to dull and disappear. ""That's important because so many species use red signals to attract mates or deter enemies,"" Johnsen said.The team predicts that some species will be more vulnerable than others. Take, for instance, fish that can't take the edge off the heat by relocating toward the poles of the planet. Particularly in semi-enclosed waters such as the Mediterranean and Black seas or the Gulf of Mexico, or in coral reefs, which are stuck to the sea bed -- these species will have no option but to dive deeper to keep their cool, Caves said.As a next step, they hope to test their ideas in the coral reefs around the island of Guam, where butterflyfishes and fire gobies use their vivid color patterns to recognize members of their own species and woo mates.""The problem is only accelerating,"" Caves said. By the end of this century, it's possible that sea surface temperatures will have heated up another 4.8 degrees Celsius, or an increase of 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to the 1896-2005 average.And while warming is happening faster at the poles, ""tropical waters are feeling the effects too,"" Caves said.This research was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement (No 793454).",Climate,2021.0,"Research suggests that fish species are shifting into deeper waters due to climate change, which could impact their ability to see color cues crucial for survival.

As fish descend into deeper waters, the filtering and absorption of wavelengths by the water cause colors to appear duller, with red being the first to disappear.

For a growing number of people, climate change is also being added to the list of considerations, says a University of Arizona researcher.","Sabrina Helm, an associate professor in the Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, is lead author of a new peer-reviewed study that looks at how climate change is affecting people's decisions about whether to have children.""For many people, the question of whether to have children or not is one of the biggest they will face in their lives,"" Helm said. ""If you are worried about what the future will look like because of climate change, obviously it will impact how you view this very important decision in your life.""Helm and her collaborators wanted to better understand the specific climate change-related reasons people have for not wanting to have children. They started by analyzing online comments posted in response to news articles written about the growing trend of people forgoing having children due to climate change concerns.They then sought out adults ages 18 to 35 who said climate change plays an important role in their reproductive decision-making. They interviewed 24 participants about their concerns.The researchers' findings, published in the journal Population and Environment, identify three major themes that emerged in both the online comments and the interviews.1) Overconsumption. This was the most common concern expressed by interviewees, Helm said. Almost all participants said they worried about how children would contribute to climate change through an increased carbon footprint and overuse of resources that could become more scarce in the future, such as food and water.2) Overpopulation. Overpopulation was the prevailing concern among online commenters, and it often came up in interviews as well, Helm said. Some participants said they felt having more than two children would be problematic and even selfish, as they would be ""over-replacing"" themselves and their partner. Some said they saw adoption as a more responsible choice. ""Adoption was seen as the low-carbon alternative,"" Helm said.3) An uncertain future. Interviewees and online commenters also frequently expressed a sense of doom about the future if climate change continues unchecked. Many said they would feel guilty or as if they were doing something morally or ethically wrong if they brought a child into a world with such an uncertain future.While the ""doom"" perspective was prevalent, it was also balanced with expressions of hope, Helm said. Some interviewees and commenters said the very idea of children gives hope for a better and brighter future. Others expressed hope that future generations could contribute to environmental improvement by increasing climate change awareness and action.""There was a hope that future generations will get the job done and makes things better,"" Helm said. ""But that puts a lot of burden on small children.""Understanding how climate change affects reproductive decision-making is part of a larger effort by Helm and other researchers to understand how climate change is impacting individuals mentally and emotionally overall. Helm noted that climate change anxiety is on the rise, especially in younger people.""Many people now are severely affected in terms of mental health with regard to climate change concerns,"" she said. ""Then you add this very important decision about having kids, which very few take lightly, and this is an important topic from a public health perspective. It all ties into this bigger topic of how climate change affects people beyond the immediate effect of weather phenomena.""Helm said many study participants expressed anger and frustration that their concerns aren't taken seriously by family members and friends, who might dismissively tell them they will change their minds about having kids when they're older or meet the right person.""It's still a bit taboo to even talk about this -- about how worried they are -- in an environment where there are still people who deny climate change,"" Helm said.

But they could help remedy California's increasingly parched groundwater systems, according to a new Stanford-led study. The research, published in ","""This is the first comprehensive assessment of floodwater recharge potential in California under climate change,"" said study lead author Xiaogang He, an assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering at the National University of Singapore who pursued the research as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's Program on Water in the West.Whether it's rivers overflowing in the Central Valley flatlands, high-tide storms hitting lowland coastal areas, flash floods drenching southern deserts or impermeable concrete-laden cities pooling with water, California is susceptible to flooding. Alternately, looming droughts often raise concern about water supply, as diminished groundwater sinks land, contaminates drinking water and reduces surface supplies. These declining reserves also hamper climate resilience -- during periods of drought up to 60 percent of the state's water comes from groundwater and 85 percent of Californians depend on the resource for at least a portion of their water supply.As climate change intensifies the severity and frequency of these extreme events, amplifying refill rates could help the state reach a more balanced groundwater budget. One practice, called water banking or managed aquifer recharge, involves augmenting surface infrastructure, such as reservoirs or pipelines, with underground infrastructure, such as aquifers and wells, to increase the transfer of floodwater for storage in groundwater basins.A newer strategy for managing surface water, compared to more traditional methods like reservoirs and dams, water banking poses multiple benefits including flood risk reduction and improved ecosystem services. While groundwater basins offer a vast network for water safekeeping, pinpointing areas prime for replenishment, gauging infrastructure needed and the amount of water available remains key, especially in a warming and uncertain climate.""Integrating managed aquifer recharge with floodwaters into already complex water management infrastructure offers many benefits, but requires careful consideration of uncertainties and constraints. Our growing understanding of climate change makes this an opportune time to examine the potential for these benefits,"" said senior author David Freyberg, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford.The researchers designed a framework to estimate future floodwater availability across the state. Developing a hybrid computer model using hydrologic and climate simulations and statistical tools, the team calculated water available for recharge under different climate change scenarios through 2090. They also identified areas where infrastructure investments should be prioritized to tap floodwater potential and increase recharge.The team found California will experience increased floodwater from both heavier rain patterns and earlier snowmelt due to warmer temperatures, under a narrowing window of concentrated wet weather. In particular, the Sacramento River and North Coast, along with the northern and central Sierra Nevada region, will see more substantial floodwater volumes. These deluges could overload current water infrastructure, such as reservoirs and aqueducts. However, if the region is standing ready with additional floodwater diversion infrastructure, such as canals or pipelines, it could maximize recharge potential and transfer more of it toward arid Southern California.Future projections find unchanging or in some cases even drier conditions in Southern California. This widening divide is bad news for the region, which currently has greater groundwater depletion and recharge needs than its northern counterpart. This mismatch of water abundance and need reveals a profound challenge for recharge practices, in terms of moving high volumes of water from where it will be available in Northern California to where it will be needed southward.The researchers also found recharge estimates for the San Joaquin Valley -- one of the world's most productive agricultural regions -- could help restock a large portion of depleted groundwater aquifers. Sitting at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains, this region will need to accommodate larger volumes of water both above and below the surface in order to maximize refill potential. Water managers will need to expand conveyance projects and reopen reservoirs there.While climate impacts are the most dominant influence, the researchers point out that other factors, including infrastructure capacity, policy constraints, financial and environmental concerns must be jointly considered during the planning process.The study's framework is adaptable and scalable for managing drought, flood and depleted groundwater aquifers worldwide.""At the global scale only 1 percent of groundwater recharge occurs from managed aquifer recharge,"" He said. ""This work can be applied to help other depleted aquifers, such as the North China Plain or India's Upper Ganges, reach and maintain sustainable groundwater levels.""",Climate,2021.0,"A study led by Xiaogang He from the National University of Singapore provides the first comprehensive assessment of floodwater recharge potential in California under climate change.

Now, in a new study, researchers have discovered carbon dioxide-rich liquid water inside a meteorite from an asteroid that formed 4.6 billion years ago. This finding suggests that the meteorite's parent asteroid formed beyond Jupiter's orbit before being transported into the inner solar system and provides key evidence for the dynamics of the Solar System's formation.","Water is abundant in our solar system. Even outside of our own planet, scientists have detected ice on the moon, in Saturn's rings and in comets, liquid water on Mars and under the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus, and traces of water vapor in the scorching atmosphere of Venus. Studies have shown that water played an important role in the early evolution and formation of the solar system. To learn more about this role, planetary scientists have searched for evidence of liquid water in extraterrestrial materials such as meteorites, most of which originate from asteroids that formed in the early history of the solar system.Scientists have even found water as hydroxyls and molecules in meteorites in the context of hydrous minerals, which are basically solids with some ionic or molecular water incorporated within them. Dr. Akira Tsuchiyama, Visiting Research Professor at Ritsumeikan University, says, ""Scientists further expect that liquid water should remain as fluid inclusions in minerals that precipitated in aqueous fluid"" (or, to put it simply, formed from drops of water that contained various other things dissolved inside them). Scientists have found such liquid water inclusions inside salt crystals located within a class of meteorites known as ordinary chondrites, which represent the vast majority of all meteorites found on Earth though the salt actually originated from other, more primitive parent objects.Prof. Tsuchiyama and his colleagues wanted to know whether liquid water inclusions are present in a form of calcium carbonate known as calcite within a class of meteorites known as ""carbonaceous chondrites,"" which come from asteroids that formed very early in the history of the solar system. They therefore examined samples of the Sutter's Mill meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite originating in an asteroid that formed 4.6 billion years ago. The results of their investigation, led by Prof. Tsuchiyama, appear in an article recently published in The researchers used advanced microscopy techniques to examine the Sutter's Mill meteorite fragments, and they found a calcite crystal containing a nanoscale aqueous fluid inclusion that contains at least 15% carbon dioxide. This finding confirms that calcite crystals in ancient carbonaceous chondrites can indeed contain not only liquid water, but also carbon dioxide.The presence of liquid water inclusions within the Sutter's Mill meteorite has interesting implications concerning the origins of the meteorite's parent asteroid and the early history of the solar system. The inclusions likely occurred due to the parent asteroid forming with bits of frozen water and carbon dioxide inside of it. This would require the asteroid to have formed in a part of the solar system cold enough for water and carbon dioxide to freeze, and these conditions would place the site of formation far outside of Earth's orbit, likely beyond even the orbit of Jupiter. The asteroid must then have been transported to the inner regions of the solar system where fragments could later collide with the planet Earth. This assumption is consistent with recent theoretical studies of the solar system's evolution that suggest that asteroids rich in small, volatile molecules like water and carbon dioxide formed beyond Jupiter's orbit before being transported to areas closer to the sun. The most likely cause of the asteroid's transportation into the inner solar system would be the gravitational effects of the planet Jupiter and its migration.In conclusion, the discovery of water inclusions within a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite from the early history of the solar system is an important achievement for planetary science. Prof. Tsuchiyama proudly notes, ""This achievement shows that our team could detect a tiny fluid trapped in a mineral 4.6 billion years ago.""By obtaining chemical snapshots of an ancient meteorite's contents, his team's work can provide important insights into processes at work in the solar system's early history.",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists have discovered liquid water inclusions within a meteorite called the Sutter's Mill meteorite, which is a carbonaceous chondrite originating from an asteroid formed 4.6 billion years ago.

When a climate-warming gas such as carbon dioxide or methane is emitted into the atmosphere, its impacts may be felt years and even decades into the future -- in the form of rising sea levels, changes in agricultural productivity, or more extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Those impacts are quantified in a metric called the ""social cost of carbon,"" considered a vital tool for making sound and efficient climate policies.","Now a new study by a team including researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley reports that the social cost of methane -- a greenhouse gas that is 30 times as potent as carbon dioxide in its ability to trap heat -- varies by as much as an order of magnitude between industrialized and developing regions of the world.Published recently in the journal ""The paper broadly supports the previous U.S. government estimates of the social cost of methane, but if you use the number the way it's typically used -- as a global estimate, as if all countries are equal -- then it doesn't account for the inequities,"" said Berkeley Lab scientist William Collins, one of the study's co-authors.The lead authors of the study were David Anthoff, a professor in UC Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group, and Frank Errickson, a graduate student in the group at the time of the study. ""The Biden administration's climate policy agenda calls for prioritizing environmental justice and equity. We provide a way for them to directly incorporate concerns for equity in methane emission regulations,"" said Errickson, now a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University. ""Our results capture that the same climate impact, when measured in dollars, causes a greater loss in well-being for low-income regions relative to wealthy ones.""Like the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane is a metric that is not widely used by the public but is increasingly used by government agencies and corporations in making decisions around policies and capital investments. By properly accounting for future damages that may be caused by greenhouse gas emissions, policymakers can weigh present costs against future avoided harms. In fact, the recent White House executive order on the climate crisis established a working group to provide an accurate accounting of the social costs of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide within a year.""President Biden's action represents a much-needed return of science-based policy in the United States,"" said Anthoff. ""Devastating weather events and wildfires have become more common, and the costs of climate impacts are mounting.""""The social costs of methane and carbon dioxide are used directly in cost-benefit analyses all the time,"" Collins said. ""You have to figure out how to maximize the benefit from a dollar spent on mitigating methane emissions, as opposed to any of the other ways in which one might choose to spend that dollar. You want to make sure that you are not using a gold-plated band-aid.""Given the current estimate of global methane emissions of 300 million metric tons per year, that puts the annual social cost of methane at nearly $300 billion, said Collins, the head of Berkeley Lab's Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division and also a professor in UC Berkeley's Earth and Planetary Science Department. ""Wet areas will get wetter and dry areas dryer, so there's an increase in severity of storms and droughts,"" he said. ""The cost would include all the things that flow from that, such as infrastructure damaged, increased expenditures around keeping places cool, health risks associated with heat, and so on.""While some methane comes from natural sources -- mostly wetlands -- about 60% of methane emissions come from human activity, including agriculture, fossil fuel production, landfills, and livestock production. It is considered a short-lived climate pollutant, staying in the atmosphere for only a decade or so, compared to more than 100 years for carbon dioxide.""Given its potency as a greenhouse gas, regulating emissions of methane has long been recognized as critical component for designing an economically efficient climate policy,"" said Anthoff. ""Our study updates the social cost of methane estimates and fills a critical gap in determining social costs.""Under the Obama administration, the price was estimated at about $1,400 per metric ton. The Berkeley researchers made a technical correction in accounting for offsetting influences on the climate system, arriving at global mean estimate of $922 per metric ton. ""We're suggesting they slightly overestimated it,"" Collins said.But more importantly, the uncertainty around the social cost of methane comes more from the social side, not the physics. ""As a climate scientist, we've been busy trying to improve our estimates of the warming caused by methane,"" Collins said. ""But it turns out the physics side is no longer the major source of uncertainty in the social cost of methane. It's now moved to the socio-economic sector, accounting for the damages and inequities.""How societies choose to develop in the future -- such as expanding cities along coastlines or areas prone to flooding or wildfires, or moving away from such areas -- are a big unknown. ""If we choose mitigate climate change more aggressively, the social cost of methane drops drastically,"" Collins said.""Continuing our work to further explore the relationship between climate change and socioeconomic uncertainties -- not to mention the complex but important issues that arise when we account for equity -- is a promising area for future research and policy exploration,"" said Anthoff.Other study co-authors were Klaus Keller and Vivek Srikrishnan of The Pennsylvania State University.

This is what an international research team involving the Universities of Bayreuth and Göttingen demands in a paper published in the journal ","In May 2020, the EU Commission presented its ""Farm-to-Fork"" strategy, which is part of the ""European Green Deal."" The aim is to make European agriculture and its food system more sustainable. In particular, the proportion of organic farming in the EU's total agricultural land is to be increased to 25 percent by 2030. However, if current EU legislation remains in place, this increase will by no means guarantee more sustainability, as the current study by scientists from Bayreuth, Göttingen, Düsseldorf, Heidelberg, Wageningen, Alnarp, and Berkeley shows.Numerous applications derived from new biotechnological processes are severely restricted or even banned by current EU law. This is especially true for gene editing, a new precision tool used in plant breeding. ""Expanding organic farming further under the current legal restrictions on biotechnology could easily lead to less sustainability instead of more. Yet gene editing in particular offers great potential for sustainable agriculture,"" says Kai Purnhagen, lead author of the study and Professor of German & European Food Law at the University of Bayreuth.Organic farming focuses on greater farming diversity and prohibits the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, it can have a beneficial effect on environmental protection and biodiversity at the local level. However, compared to conventional farming, organic farming also delivers lower yields. Consequently, more land is needed to produce the same amount of high-quality food. ""As global demand for high-quality food increases, more organic farming in the EU would lead to an expansion of agricultural land elsewhere in the world. This could easily result in environmental costs that exceed any local environmental benefits in the EU, as the conversion of natural land into agricultural land is one of the biggest drivers of global climate change and biodiversity loss,"" says co-author Matin Qaim, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Göttingen.The combination of organic farming and modern biotechnology could be a way to resolve this dilemma. ""Gene editing offers unique opportunities to make food production more sustainable and to further improve the quality, but also the safety, of food. With the help of these new molecular tools, more robust plants can be developed that deliver high yields for high-quality nutrition, even with less fertiliser,"" says co-author Stephan Clemens, Professor of Plant Physiology at the University of Bayreuth and founding Dean of the new Faculty of Life Sciences: Food, Nutrition & Health on the Kulmbach campus. In addition, gene editing is used to breed fungus-resistant plants that thrive under organic farming without copper-containing pesticides. Copper is particularly toxic to soil and aquatic organisms, but its use to control fungi is nevertheless permitted in organic farming because of the lack of non-chemical alternatives to date. ""Organic farming and gene editing could therefore complement each other very well and, combined, could contribute to more local and global sustainability,"" says Qaim.However, the use of genetic engineering in organic farming requires legal changes at the EU level. ""There is certainly no political majority for this at present, because genetic engineering is viewed very critically by many. Yet perhaps improved communication could gradually lead to greater societal openness, at least towards gene editing, because this form of genetic engineering enables very targeted breeding without having to introduce foreign genes into the plants. Highlighting this point could dispel many of the widespread fears of genetic engineering,"" says Purnhagen.",Climate,2021.0,"The current study conducted by scientists from multiple universities highlights the potential conflict between the EU's goal to increase organic farming and the restrictions on biotechnological processes, particularly gene editing, under current EU legislation.

You can then process the carbon monoxide further, for example into methanol, other chemical base materials or even into fuel.""This reaction is not new, but it has not really been implemented on an industrial scale for COChristoph Rameshan and his team investigated how to tailor a material from the class of perovskites specifically for this reaction, and he was successful: ""We tried out a few things and finally came up with a perovskite made of cobalt, iron, calcium and neodymium that has excellent properties,"" says Rameshan.Because of its crystal structure, the perovskite allows certain atoms to migrate through it. For example, during catalysis, cobalt atoms from the inside of the material travel towars the surface and form tiny nanoparticles there, which are then particularly chemically active. At the same time, so-called oxygen vacancies form -- positions in the crystal where an oxygen atom should actually sit. It is precisely at these vacant positions that CO""We were able to show that our perovskite is significantly more stable than other catalysts,"" says Christoph Rameshan. ""It also has the advantage that it can be regenerated: If its catalytic activity does wane after a certain time, you can simply restore it to its original state with the help of oxygen and continue to use it.""Initial assessments show that the catalyst is also economically promising. ""It is more expensive than other catalysts, but only by about a factor of three, and it is much more durable,"" says Rameshan. ""We would now like to try to replace the neodymium with something else, which could reduce the cost even further.""Theoretically, you could use such technologies to get CO",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists at TU Wien have developed a perovskite material that exhibits excellent catalytic properties for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon monoxide (CO).

But, solar parks also take up land, with potential impacts on the environment. In the UK approximately half of PV has been installed as ground-mounted solar parks, ranging in size from 1-40 hectares.Shading caused by rows of solar panels affects air temperature, rainfall and evaporation which has a knock on effect on soil, vegetation and biodiversity.However, in the UK solar parks are often built in intensively managed agricultural landscapes and thus are poor for biodiversity. In this scenario, solar parks may in fact provide opportunities to establish hotspots of pollinator biodiversity which in turn can help pollinate local crops such as oilseed, strawberries and apples.Lancaster University's Hollie Blaydes said: ""Many pollinators are in decline both in the UK and in other parts of the world. Actions to conserve pollinators include reversing agricultural intensification and maintaining natural habitat, both of which can be achieved within solar parks. Often built amongst agricultural land, solar parks offer a unique opportunity to provide pollinator resources where they are most needed.""Prof Simon Potts, University of Reading, said: ""As well as promoting biodiversity, pollinator-friendly solar parks also have the potential to provide tangible economic benefits to farmers through enhancing pollination services to adjacent agricultural land, boosting crop yields.""Imagine a world where solar parks not only produced much needed low carbon electricity but were also diverse and attractive wildflower meadows buzzing with insect life.""Dr Alona Armstrong, Lancaster University Environment Centre said: ""Land use change for solar parks could cause further degradation of our environment but, if done well, offers much potential to improve our environment. If we transition well, we could use energy system decarbonisation to also address the ecological crisis.

A new paper, ""Changes in the Gulf Stream preceded rapid warming of the Northwest Atlantic Shelf,"" published in ","""We used satellite data to show that when the Gulf Stream migrates closer to the underwater plateau known as the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, as it did after 2008, it blocks the southwestward transport of the Labrador Current that would otherwise provide cold, fresh, oxygen-rich water to the North American shelf,"" said lead author Gonçalves Neto. This mechanism explains why the most recent decade has been the hottest on record at the edge of the Northeast United States and Canada, as the delivery system of cold water to the region got choked off by the presence of the Gulf Stream.The URI research team noted the importance of finding that the satellite-observed signature of the Gulf Stream's position relative to the Grand Banks precedes subsurface shelf warming by over a year. ""By monitoring satellite observations for changes near the Grand Banks, we can predict changes coming to the Northeast U.S. shelf with potentially enough lead time to inform fishery management decision-making,"" said GSO graduate student and co-author Joe Langan.The Grand Banks of Newfoundland is hardly a stranger to attention. It was near this feature that an iceberg sank the R.M.S. Titanic, one impetus for creation of the International Ice Patrol. The Ice Patrol has been collecting oceanographic data in this region for over a century, allowing the URI team to put recent satellite observations in a much longer-term context. Though the 2008 shift at the edge of the Grand Banks created warmer and saltier conditions than ever recorded since 1930, there was a similar shift in the 1970s relative to the decades preceding it. Thus, the circulation change directly observed by satellites might have had a precedent about 50 years ago.Jaime Palter, GSO associate professor of oceanography and co-author of the study, marveled at the long record, and what remains unknown. ""We still don't know what caused the abrupt shift of the circulation near the Grand Banks inferred in the 1970s and observed in 2008, or whether this is the new normal for the circulation and the temperatures of the northeast shelf,"" said Palter.

Now researchers have revealed the long-term impact of that extreme melt.","Using a new approach to ice-penetrating radar data, Stanford University scientists show that this melting left behind a contiguous layer of refrozen ice inside the snowpack, including near the middle of the ice sheet where surface melting is usually minimal. Most importantly, the formation of the melt layer changed the ice sheet's behavior by reducing its ability to store future meltwater. The research appears in ""When you have these extreme, one-off melt years, it's not just adding more to Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise in that year -- it's also creating these persistent structural changes in the ice sheet itself,"" said lead study author Riley Culberg, a PhD student in electrical engineering. ""This continental-scale picture helps us understand what kind of melt and snow conditions allowed this layer to form.""The 2012 melt season was caused by unusually warm temperatures exacerbated by high atmospheric pressure over Greenland -- an extreme event that may have been caused or intensified by climate change. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced five record-breaking melt seasons since 2000, with the most recent occurring in 2019.""Normally we'd say the ice sheet would just shrug off weather -- ice sheets tend to be big, calm, slow things,"" said senior author Dustin Schroeder, an assistant professor of geophysics at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). ""This is really one of the first cases where you can say, shockingly, in some ways, these slow, calm ice sheets care a lot about a single extreme event in a particularly warm year.""Shifting scenariosAirborne radar data, a major expansion to single-site field observations on the icy poles, is typically used to study the bottom of the ice sheet. But by pushing past technical and computational limitations through advanced modeling, the team was able to reanalyze radar data collected by flights from NASA's Operation IceBridge from 2012 to 2017 to interpret melt near the surface of the ice sheet, at a depth up to about 50 feet.""Once those challenges were overcome, all of a sudden, we started seeing meltwater ice layers near the surface of the ice sheet,"" Schroeder said. ""It turns out we've been building records that, as a community, we didn't fully realize we were making.""Melting ice sheets and glaciers are the biggest contributors to sea-level rise -- and the most complex elements to incorporate into climate model projections. Ice sheet regions that haven't experienced extreme melt can store meltwater in the upper 150 feet, thereby preventing it from flowing into the ocean. A melt layer like the one from 2012 can reduce the storage capacity to about 15 feet in some parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet, according to the research.The type of melt followed by rapid freeze experienced in 2012 can be compared to wintry conditions in much of the world: snow falls to the ground, a few warm days melt it a little, then when it freezes again, it creates slick ice -- the kind that no one would want to drive on.""The melt event in 2012 is impacting the way the ice sheet responds to surface melt even now,"" Culberg said. ""These structural changes mean the way the ice sheet responds to surface melting is going to be impacted longer term.""In the long run, meltwater that can no longer be stored in the upper part of the ice sheet may drain down to the ice bed, creating slippery conditions that speed up the ice and send chunks into the ocean, raising sea levels more quickly.Polar patternsGreenland currently experiences change much more rapidly than its South Pole counterpart. But lessons from Greenland may be applied to Antarctica when the seasons shift, Schroeder said.""I think now there's no question that when you're trying to project into the future, a warming Antarctic will have all these processes,"" Schroeder said.

During the last 15 years the intensification of upper-ocean currents resulted in an increasing oxygen content in the equatorial region.,"Due to global warming, not only the temperatures in the atmosphere and in the ocean are rising, but also winds and ocean currents as well as the oxygen distribution in the ocean are changing. For example, the oxygen content in the ocean has decreased globally by about 2% in the last 60 years, particularly strong in the tropical oceans. However, these regions are characterized by a complex system of ocean currents. At the equator, one of the strongest currents, the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), transports water masses eastwards across the Atlantic. The water transport by the EUC is more than 60 times larger than that of the Amazon river. For many years, scientists at GEOMAR have been investigating in cooperation with the international PIRATA programme fluctuations of this current with fixed observation platforms, so-called moorings. Based on the data obtained from these moorings, they were able to prove that the EUC has strengthened by more than 20% between 2008 and 2018. The intensification of this major ocean current is associated with increasing oxygen concentrations in the equatorial Atlantic and an increase in the oxygen-rich layer near the surface. Such a thickening of the surface oxygenated layer represents a habitat expansion for tropical pelagic fish. The results of the study have now been published in the international journal ""At first, this statement sounds encouraging, but it does not describe the entire complexity of the system,"" says project leader and first author Prof. Dr. Peter Brandt from GEOMAR. ""We found that the strengthening of the Equatorial Undercurrent is mainly caused by a strengthening of the trade winds in the western tropical North Atlantic,"" Peter Brandt explains further. The analysis of a 60-year data set has shown that the recent oxygen increase in the upper equatorial Atlantic is associated with a multidecadal variability characterised by low oxygen concentrations in the 1990s and early 2000s and high concentrations in the 1960s and 1970s. ""In this respect, our results do not contradict the global trend, but indicate that the observed current intensification likely will switch back into a phase of weaker currents associated with enhanced oxygen reduction. It shows the need for long-term observations in order to be able to separate natural fluctuations of the climate system from trends such as oxygen depletion caused by climate warming,"" says Brandt.The changes in oxygen supply in the tropics due to circulation fluctuations have an impact on marine ecosystems and ultimately on fisheries in these regions. ""Habitat compression or expansion for tropical pelagic fish can lead to altered predator-prey relationships, but also make it particularly difficult to assess overfishing of economically relevant fish species, such as tuna,"" says Dr Rainer Kiko, co-author from the Laboratoire d'Océanographie de Villefranche at Sorbonne University, Paris.The investigations are based partly on a ship expedition carried out along the equator at the end of 2019 with the German research vessel METEOR. This expedition included a physical, chemical, biogeochemical and biological measurement programme that supports the development of climate-based predictions for marine ecosystems as part of the EU-funded TRIATLAS project. While another expedition with RV METEOR along the equator had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several long-term moorings in the tropical Atlantic -- including the one at the equator -- will now be recovered and redeployed during an additional expedition with RV SONNE in June-August 2021, of course under strict quarantine conditions.",Climate,2021.0,"Global warming is leading to various changes in the Earth's climate system.

The study combined airborne radar data to determine the thickness of the ice cap with on-site measurements of the thickness of the ice cap and satellite data. Researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute -- University of Copenhagen gathered the data from the ice cap in 2015, and this work has now come to fruition in the form of more exact predictions of local climate conditions.","The accuracy of the study allows for the construction of models for other smaller ice caps and glaciers, affording significantly improved local projections of the condition of glaciers locally, around the globe. The results have recently been published in The initial, principal aim of the study, was to assess the thickness and volume of the Renland Ice Cap, and in the process, validate computer-modelled data against real data. Airborne radar, which measured the thickness of the ice, was compared with measurement results that were known in advance. In addition, researchers availed of satellite-based measurements of the ice velocity on the surface of the ice cap, again juxtaposed with various parameters entered into the computer model, e.g. ""basal slide"" -- in other words, the velocity of movement at the bottom of the ice cap. The combined results provided researchers with an extremely detailed basis material for constructing a computer model that can be applied in other situations.Iben Koldtoft, PhD student at the Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth section at the Niels Bohr Institute, and first author of the scientific article, explains: ""We now have the most optimal parameters for this ice flow model, the Parallet Ice Sheet Model, for the Renland Ice Cap. But despite these being specific local measurements for Renland, we can use these modelling parameters to simulate the ice cap over an entire ice age cycle, for example, and compare the results with the Renland ice core we drilled in 2015. We can examine to what extent the ice cap has changed over time, or how quickly the ice will melt if the temperature rises by a few degrees in the future. Or put more concisely: We now know how the model can be ""tuned"" to match different climate scenarios. This ensures greater accuracy and a method that is also transferable to other smaller ice caps and glaciers.""""In fact, we can see that our scientific article initially received many views from Japan and Argentina. At first this was a bit surprising -- why there, exactly? But it makes absolute sense. These are countries with smaller local ice sheets and glaciers, who are now excited to be able to project the future evolution of these,"" comments Iben Koldtoft.The larger ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are of course the most important, when assessing temperature changes and the effects of melting on global climate. However, the smaller ice caps react faster and can be considered as ""mini- environments,"" where it is possible to follow developments across a shorter timescale. In addition, it is easier to model the smaller scenarios more precisely, points out Iben Koldtoft.""If we look at Svalbard, an archipelago that lies very far north, they experience climate change as having a far greater local effect than one sees in Greenland, for example. Over time, of course, all these changes will eventually affect the entire climate system, but we can observe it more clearly on a smaller scale.""In 2015 a core was drilled on the Renland Ice Cap. In the intervening years, scientists have extracted data from the recovered ice core in the form of water isotopes, gases and chemical measurements. These are all proxies for temperature, precipitation accumulation, altitude changes and other climate conditions of east Greenland, where the Renland Ice Cap is located. This data can now be compared with the detailed study and with data from other locations in Greenland. As a result, the study contributes to the increasingly detailed picture of how the climate is changing. Iben Koldtoft emphasises the importance of combining the observational data with computer modelling, and that climate research in general is at a stage where the use of advanced computer simulations and the ability to ""tune"" them correctly, is now a vital competence.

But so far even the basic knowledge on the global geography of genetic diversity was limited.","That now changes with a recent paper from Globe Institute. Professor David Nogues Bravo and his team has spent the last eight years combining data from scientific gene banks with scenarios of future climate and land-use change. The result is the first ever global assessment of how it will impact the genetic diversity of mammals, e.g. when tropical forests are converted to agricultural land.'Our study identifies both genetically poor and highly diverse areas severely exposed to global change, paving the way to better estimate the vulnerability to global change such as rise in temperature as well as land-use changes. It could help countries to find out how much of the genetic diversity in their own country may be exposed to different global change impacts, while also establishing priorities and conservation policies', says David Nogues Bravo.For example, Northern Scandinavia will be heavily impacted by climate change and not so much from land use change, whereas the tropical areas of the world will suffer from both climate change and land-use change. However, David Nogues Bravo underlines that it is difficult to compare areas.'The genetic diversity in Scandinavia is always going to be lower than in the tropics, but that doesn't mean that the overall diversity there is not important. If we lose populations and species such as the polar bear, it's just one species but it will it will impact the total stability of ecosystems. However, the largest threat to genetic diversity will be in the tropical areas, which currently harbor the largest diversity of the bricks of life, genes. These regions include ecosystems like mangroves, jungles and grasslands', says David Nogues Bravo.The researchers have looked into gene banks with mitochondrial data from mammals. The mitochondria also regulate the metabolism, and by looking how it has changed over time, it can also unveil changes in diversity.'The mitochondrial diversity is a broad estimate of adaptive capacity. We also used to think that mitochondria was a neutral marker, when it is in fact under selection. That means that some selection may relate to the physiological limits of a species in relation to climate, which makes it a very useful tool for researchers to track how global change impacts the genetic diversity in a specific area', explains David Nogues Bravo.For many samples, there were not any geographical information available. The researchers used artificial intelligence to add geographical locations and then they built models predicting how much genetic exits in places without data.Then the researchers analyzed maps of genetic diversity, future climate change and future land-use change, to reveal how and where global change will impact mammals.The research has attracted the attention of Secretariat of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. David Nogues Bravo hope that the assessment map could become an important tool for the high-level summits among countries to help define policies for biodiversity protection.'We are only now starting to have the tools, data and knowledge to understand how genetic diversity changes across the globe. In a decade from now, we will be able to know also how much of that genetic diversity has been lost since the Industrial Revolution for thousands of species and in a stronger position to bring effective measures to protect it', he says.In the coming years, he hopes that scientists will map the global genetic diversity of many other forms of life, including plants, fungi and animals across the lands, rivers and oceans.'Have been attempts to map the genetic diversity for amphibians, birds and reptiles, but we don't have maps for plants, insects or fungi. And whereas there are around 5000 mammal species, there are many more insect or fungi species, maybe millions. We don't even know how many, yet. So it will take longer, but it will come in the next decade', he says.'We hope to see more of these assessments in the next decade, and to complement then with long-term monitoring programs, in which we can monitor the genetic diversity of thousands of species and ecosystems across the planet continually', says David Nogues Bravo.",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study conducted by Professor David Nogues Bravo and his team at Globe Institute has provided the first-ever global assessment of how future climate and land-use changes will impact the genetic diversity of mammals.

But the forest that climbs up this mountain range provides another important service to humanity.,"Andean forests are helping to protect the planet by acting as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and keeping some of this climate-altering gas out of circulation, according to new research published in The study -- which draws upon two decades of data from 119 forest-monitoring plots in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina -- was produced by an international team of scientists including researchers supported by the Living Earth Collaborative at Washington University in St. Louis. The lead author was Alvaro Duque from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellín.""Based on the information that we have, Andean forests are a carbon sink -- capturing more carbon than they emit,"" said J. Sebastián Tello, a co-author of the study and a principal investigator for the Living Earth Collaborative working group titled, ""A synthesis of patterns and mechanisms of diversity and forest change in the Andes: A global biodiversity hotspot.""""The amount of carbon that is stored in the aboveground biomass in the stems and leaves of trees is actually increasing through time, potentially offsetting some of the carbon dioxide emissions that are released to the atmosphere,"" said Tello, an associate scientist at the Center for Conservation and Sustainable Development at the Missouri Botanical Garden.Tello leads the Madidi Project, a long-term study that the Missouri Botanical Garden has supported for nearly 20 years, involving plant diversity and forest change in Bolivia. Twenty-six of the forest plots included in this study were from the Madidi Project.""Two critical research questions are how and why the functioning of ecosystems is being impacted by climate change,"" added Jonathan Myers, associate professor of biology in Arts & Sciences at Washington University, another co-author of the new study. ""Carbon storage is one of the most important ecosystem services that helps to mitigate the effects of rising carbon dioxide levels under climate change and temperature warming.""This study provides insights into how species on the move, under climate change, might be impacting these broader ecosystem services important to humanity,"" Myers said.Carbon is an important building block of life on Earth, but the element contributes to global warming when it is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Living plant tissues such as the stems, bark, branches and twigs of trees can act as a carbon sink because they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis.By locking in carbon, trees in forests around the world play a role in maintaining global climate stability. Some forests play a bigger role than others -- the Andes prime among them, the study found.Tropical and subtropical ecosystems are believed to account for nearly 70% of all the carbon sequestered by Earth's forests. But previous estimates of tropical carbon uptake were largely based on studies of lowland ecosystems, such as the Amazon.This study incorporates data from forest plots spanning a range of more than 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) in elevation across the subtropical and tropical Andes. The results indicate that the Andes are similar to other tropical forests in that they are acting as aboveground carbon sinks. However, the overall relative strength of the Andean carbon sink exceeds estimates from previous studies conducted in lowland tropical forests in Amazonia, Africa or Southeast Asia, the researchers discovered.Factors such as precipitation, temperature and size-dependent mortality of trees tend to drive carbon storage dynamics in Andean forests.Because of its vast size, the Amazon forest currently accumulates more carbon than the Andean forest. But recent research has suggested that the Amazon might become saturated with carbon in the near future. Under this scenario, the continued net uptake of carbon in Andean forests will become even more important.As a neighbor to the relatively well-studied Amazon forest, much about Andean forest ecosystems remains comparatively unknown. Challenging mountain terrain combined with remoteness makes it harder for scientists to reach parts of the Andes. It's also hard to secure funding to support large-scale research projects that span multiple countries.""This paper collects and integrates information from lots of different research groups that have been working for decades independently,"" Tello said. ""It's one of the first big efforts to bring together the scientists who have been monitoring these forests.""William Farfan-Rios, a native of Cusco, Peru, and a postdoctoral research fellow of the Living Earth Collaborative, knows first-hand how difficult it is to conduct field research in the Andes. Since 2003, he has coordinated and led field campaigns and research projects with the Andes Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group, working along an elevational transect between the Andean and Amazonian forests in Peru. Farfan-Rios is also a co-author on the new study.Farfan-Rios recalled the challenges associated with one particular forest survey effort, saying: ""At the beginning, we were a team of 14 people from Cusco. And, at the end, I was the only one who was still surveying those plots. I was the only survivor of this initial team! Right now, I'm still collaborating with that group and using this information for my postdoc with the Living Earth Collaborative.""In only 1% of the Earth's land surface, the tropical Andes contain 15% of the world's plant species, or about 45,000 species in total. Approximately half of these plants -- about 20,000 species -- are endemic, meaning they are only found in the Andes. In addition to harboring extreme levels of biodiversity, Andean forests provide and protect sources of food, water and power for more than 50 million people. However, global environmental change -- including deforestation, human population growth and climate change -- is endangering Andean biodiversity and ecosystem services.""Building on William's research and the finding that Andean forests are important carbon sinks and targets for conservation, it's important to understand how upward species migrations that are occurring under climate change might sustain those ecosystem services or functions in the future,"" Myers said. ""Conservation initiatives not only support current forest biodiversity, but also habitats for species that will migrate to new areas in the future.""",Climate,2021.0,"New research published in a study led by Professor Alvaro Duque from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellín and supported by the Living Earth Collaborative at Washington University in St. Louis reveals that Andean forests in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina are acting as carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide than they emit.

In the northern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba corals also have exceptionally high tolerance to increasing seawater temperatures, now occurring as a consequence of global warming. This characteristic led coral reef scientists to designate this region as a potential coral reef refuge in the face of climate change -- a reef where corals may survive longer than others that are being lost at an alarming rate due to human pressures.","However, global climate change will also result in more variable weather patterns, including extreme cold periods. Some researchers predict that the Red Sea region is entering a cooling phase. Therefore, researchers from Bar-Ilan University and Interuniversity Institute for Marine Science in Eilat conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of an unusually cold winter on corals from the Gulf of Aqaba.In a paper recently published in the journal Previous studies conducted within the research group of Prof. Maoz Fine, of Bar-Ilan University's Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, have used controlled experiments in the Red Sea Simulator System to expose locally abundant corals to increased seawater temperatures expected to occur within and beyond this century. Multiple experiments found that corals from this region have an extraordinary tolerance to high temperatures, which kill corals elsewhere in the world. Prof. Fine's lab and researchers from other groups have tested multiple coral species and at different phases of their life cycle including the reproductive and larval phases, which are typically more sensitive to environmental change; all show similar tolerance.""Whilst we have repeatedly demonstrated the high temperature tolerance of corals on the shallow reefs in Eilat, we wanted to test the possibility that this exceptional heat tolerance comes with the trade-off of being cold-sensitive,"" said Dr. Jessica Bellworthy, who conducted her doctoral research in Prof. Fine's lab. ""Indeed we found that exposure to cold water periods causes a physiological response akin to bleaching."" Better known as a response to high water temperatures, coral bleaching, is the loss of algal symbionts that must be present within the coral tissue in order to provide the coral with energy. Without the symbionts, the chances of coral mortality are high. Coral bleaching is the leading cause of coral decline in the world today. Therefore, while the corals of the Gulf of Aqaba can tolerate very high temperatures, even an acute cold spell may cause bleaching in this population.However, Bellworthy and Fine's cold stressed corals did not die and recovered once water temperatures returned to normal. Experimental corals were maintained at normal temperatures and then underwent a second test -- an anomalously hot summer. ""It was an important discovery for us to understand that even those individuals that suffered the cold winter stress, still did not bleach at the high temperatures,"" says Bellworthy. This is good news for the corals in the Gulf of Aqaba; the high thermal tolerance is not lost and thereby corals should not undergo two bleaching events in the same year, a threat that faces others such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.Coral reefs are highly sensitive to temperature change. Therefore, identifying those that respond differently to thermal stress aids in understanding the mechanisms of environmental adaptation in corals. In addition, researchers can focus attention on conserving and studying such unique reefs.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from Bar-Ilan University and the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Science in Eilat have conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of unusually cold winter periods on corals from the Gulf of Aqaba.

A house fly, humble yarrow weed and other ""generalist"" plants and pollinators play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and may also serve as buffers against some impacts of climate change, finds new University of Colorado Boulder research.","The findings, published this month in ""A lot of times, conservation efforts are geared toward things that are rare. But oftentimes, species that are common are also in decline and could go extinct, and that could have really big repercussions for maintaining biodiversity,"" said Julian Resasco, lead author on the study and assistant professor of ecology.A ""generalist"" simply refers to a species that interacts with a lot of other species. For example: A bee that visits many different species of flowers, or conversely, a flower that's visited by many species of bees and other pollinators, said Resasco.Bumblebees are well-known generalists, their fuzzy, cute bumbling bodies having garnered a large fan base of admirers over the years. But there are unsung heroes among generalist pollinators, including an insect that we often consider with disdain: flies. According to Resasco, some flies are the most common visitors to flowers, and they visit lots of different flowers.Generalist plants that Colorado residents may recognize include mountain parsley (Pseudocymopterus montanus), which are made up of bunches of small yellow flowers, and common yarrow (Ecologists have long studied networks of interactions between plants and pollinators, and previous research has shown that generalists can be found time and time again within and across landscapes, and during warm seasons or over several years. What this new study finds is that within seasons, over the span of many years and across the landscape, generalists are able to persist and act as anchors for their communities.Because so many species rely on generalists, having healthy populations of them helps support a robust community of plants and pollinators that are less susceptible to local extinctions, said Resasco. This robustness may also be important for buffering against increasing unequal shifts in the seasonal timing of species interaction due to climate change, known as phenological mismatch.For the past six years, Resasco has returned to the same mountain meadow in the morning each week, between snowmelt in May and the return of snowfall in September, to observe bumblebees, flies and beetles dance and hop between daisies, roses and asters at six different marked plots.There's nothing particularly unique about this east-facing meadow, surrounded by aspen and spruce-fir forest. But here, just below Niwot Ridge at 9,500 feet above sea level, near the CU Boulder Mountain Research Station, Resasco counted 267 different species of pollinators that visited the flowers of 41 species of plants -- and an encouragingly healthy number of generalists.Even Resasco, an experienced ecologist recently selected as an early career fellow by the Ecological Society of America (ESA), was surprised by the biodiversity that this meadow supports. Returning year after year to the same place, he found himself noticing more and more about the place.""Every year teaches you something different,"" he said.And these findings teach us that what is common could be crucial to help ecosystems weather current and future environmental change. From setting conservation priorities that protect generalists to leaving your local flies and flowers in peace, there are many ways to support these critical but common species.Between late June and late July, these plants and pollinators will bloom and bustle in our backyards and nearby mountain meadows, awaiting hikers eager to see them. But if there aren't Instagram-worthy columbines waiting for you when you go, don't despair.""If you just take some time to stop and observe what's around you, it's always interesting,"" said Resasco.

This trend is temperature-related and cannot be compensated by heavier snowfall. By the end of the century, snow cover at 2,500 meters could disappear a month earlier than today, as simulations by environmental scientists at the University of Basel demonstrate.","Global warming demands huge adjustments in tourism, hydropower generation and agriculture in alpine areas. But the fauna and flora also have to adapt to rising temperatures. By the end of the century, continuous snow cover for 30 days below 1,600 meters is expected to be a rare occurrence. ""Snow cover protects alpine plants from frost and the growing season begins after the snowmelt. Changes in the snowmelt have a very strong influence on this period,"" explains Dr. Maria Vorkauf of the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Basel. She researched alpine plant physiology intensively for her doctoral dissertation.In a new study, Vorkauf and colleagues at the University of Basel and the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research investigated how the date of snowmelt has changed in recent decades and what shifts can be expected by the end of the 21st century. For a long time, only a few measurement series of snow cover at high elevations were available, as measurements were usually only made near inhabited regions below 2,000 meters. This changed with the IMIS measurement network, which went into operation in 2000. It automatically records the snow depth between 2,000 and 3,000 meters every half hour. The researchers combined this data with measurement series from 23 lower-lying stations with manual measurements going back to at least 1958.Analysis of the data showed that between 1958 and 2019, snow cover between 1,000 and 2,500 meters melted an average of 2.8 days earlier every decade. This shift was not linear, but was particularly strong in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This corresponds to strong temperature increases in this time period that have been verified by climate research.Based on the analyzed measurements, the researchers developed a model that makes it possible to forecast the future development of alpine snow cover. They combined their data with the latest climate scenarios for Switzerland. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise as they have so far, without consistent climate protection measures, the date of snowmelt in the last third of the 21st century is likely to move forward by six days per decade. This means that by the end of the century, snowmelt at 2,500 meters elevation would occur about one month earlier than today.The research also showed that the earlier snowmelt at high elevations cannot be compensated for by greater precipitation in the winter, as is predicted by climate models for Switzerland. ""As soon as the three-week running mean of daily air temperatures exceeds 5 °C, snow melts relatively quickly,"" explains Vorkauf. ""At high elevations in particular, temperature is much more important than the depth of the snow cover.""In the future, the early snowmelt could extend the growing season of alpine plants by about a third. As is known from studies of other alpine plant species, an earlier start to the growing season leads to fewer flowers, less leaf growth and a lower survival rate due to the higher risk of frost. ""Some species such as the Alpine sedge, which is typical of alpine grasslands, will grow and flower earlier because of the early snowmelt,"" says Vorkauf.Although temperatures in alpine areas are rising faster, alpine plant species are not more strongly affected by climate change than those at other elevations. ""The topography and exposure of alpine terrain creates very diverse microclimates on a small scale. Within these, plants can retreat over short distances at the same elevation,"" Vorkauf explains. As a result, alpine plant species do not have to ""flee"" to the heights, as is often assumed.",Climate,2021.0,"A study conducted by researchers at the University of Basel and the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research examined the impact of climate change on snowmelt and alpine plant physiology.

Using climate scenarios, the researchers projected that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, snowmelt at 2,500 meters elevation could occur one month earlier by the end of the century. The earlier snowmelt could affect alpine plants, leading to shorter growing seasons, reduced flower and leaf growth, and increased frost risk.

However, the ocean has been continuously losing oxygen for several decades. In the last 50 years, the loss of oxygen accumulates globally to about 2% of the total inventory (regionally sometimes significantly more). The main reason for this is global warming, which leads to a decrease in the solubility of gases and thus also of oxygen, as well as to a slowdown in the ocean circulation and vertical mixing. A new study published today in the scientific journal ","""In the study, a model of the Earth system was used to assess what would happen in the ocean in the long term if all COThe long-term decrease in oxygen takes place primarily in deeper layers. According to Prof. Oschlies, this also has an impact on marine ecosystems. A so-called 'metabolic index', which measures the maximum possible activity of oxygen-breathing organisms, shows a widespread decline by up to 25%, especially in the deep sea (below 2000 metres). This is likely to lead to major shifts in this habitat, which was previously considered to be very stable, explains the oceanographer. These changes have already been initiated by our historical COIn the upper layers of the ocean, the model shows a much faster response to climate action. There, a further expansion of the relatively near-surface oxygen minimum zones can be stopped within a few years if the emissions were stopped.

In order to get a sense of what our future may hold, scientists have been looking to the deep past. Now, new research from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which combines climate, ice sheet and vegetation model simulations with a suite of different climatic and geologic scenarios, opens the clearest window yet into the deep history of the Antarctic ice sheet and what our planetary future might hold.","The Antarctic ice sheet has attracted the particular interest of the scientific community because it is ""a lynchpin in the earth's climate system, affecting everything from oceanic circulation to climate,"" says Anna Ruth Halberstadt, a Ph.D candidate in geosciences and the paper's lead author, which appeared recently in the journal Yet, it has been difficult to accurately reconstruct the mid-Miocene Antarctic climate. Researchers can run models, but without geologic data to check the models against, it's difficult to choose which simulation is correct. Conversely, researchers can extrapolate from geologic data, but such data points offer only local snapshots, not a wider climatic context. ""We need both models and geologic data to know anything at all,"" says Halberstadt. There's one final complicating factor: geology. Antarctica is bisected by the Transantarctic Mountains, and any clear picture of Antarctica's deep history must be able to account for the slow uplift of the continent's mountain range. ""Without knowing the elevation,"" says Halberstadt, ""it's difficult to interpret the geologic record.""Halberstadt and her colleagues, including researchers in both New Zealand and the UK, devised a unique approach in which they coupled an ice sheet model with a climate model, while also simulating the types of vegetation that would grow under each climatic model scenario. The team used historical geologic datasets that included such known paleoclimatic data points as past temperature, vegetation, and glacial proximity, to benchmark their modeled climates. Next, the team used their benchmarked model runs to make inferences about which CO2 and tectonic model scenarios satisfied the known geologic constraints. Finally, Halberstadt and her colleagues extrapolated continent-wide glacial conditions.The research, which was supported by the NSF, reconstructed a thick but diminished ice sheet under the warmest mid-Miocene environmental conditions. In this model, although the margins of Antarctica's ice sheet had retreated significantly, greater precipitation led to a thickening of the ice sheet's interior regions. The team's modelling further suggests ice over the Wilkes Basin region of Antarctica advanced during glacial periods and retreated during interglacials. The Wilkes Basin is the region thought to be particularly sensitive to future warming and may contribute to future sea level rise.""Antarctica's paleoclimate,"" says Halberstadt, ""is fundamental to understanding the future.""",Climate,2021.0,"The Antarctic ice sheet plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, but accurately reconstructing its mid-Miocene climate has been challenging.

But new research published this week in the journal ","The study began in the wake of the dramatic 2004 fire season in Alaska when an area seven times the long-term average burned. Historically, more than half of this forested terrain has been dominated by black spruce, but after fire, faster-growing aspen and birch are replacing some of these stands. The team, made up of researchers from Northern Arizona University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Auburn University, and University of Saskatchewan surveyed 75 black spruce stands that burned in 2004 and followed their recovery over the next 13 years. They also collected a range of data from trees and soils of different ages and burn severities to construct a chronosequence, a kind of scientific time-lapse that lets researchers fast-forward through a 100-year fire cycle to see how forests recover and change.""In 2005, I thought that there was no way these forests could recover the carbon they lost in this fire,"" said Michelle Mack, a professor of biology at Northern Arizona University and the lead author of the study. ""The literature is full of papers suggesting deeper, more severe fires burn more carbon than can be replaced before the next fire. But not only did we see these deciduous trees make up for those losses, they did so rapidly.""The team found that the new aspen and birch trees where the black spruce burned accumulated carbon and nitrogen more quickly than the spruce, storing most of it in their wood and leaves as opposed to the soil organic layer. And at the end of a projected 100-year cycle, the deciduous stands had recovered as much nitrogen as was lost to fire, and more carbon than was lost, resulting in an increase in the net ecosystem carbon balance. Calculating this balance is critical as scientists work to understand the way these northern forests are changing, and the effects of those changes on the global carbon picture.""I was surprised that deciduous trees could replenish lost carbon so effectively and efficiently,"" said Heather Alexander, an assistant professor of forest ecology at Auburn and one of the paper's co-authors. ""Even though considerable carbon is combusted and emitted into the atmosphere when black spruce forests burn severely, the deciduous trees that often replace them have an amazing ability to recapture and store carbon in their aboveground leaves and wood.""""In a region with only five common tree species, this study shows how changes in tree composition can dramatically alter patterns of carbon storage in boreal forests,"" said Jill Johnstone, a northern researcher at University of Alaska-Fairbanks and co-author of the study.""Carbon is just one piece of the puzzle,"" said Mack, who said deciduous forests have other important feedbacks, or interconnected effects, on climate. ""We know these forests help cool regional climate, and we know that they are less ignitable, so fires are less likely to spread. Taken together, these effects create a relatively strong set of stabilizing climate feedbacks in the boreal forest.""But there is a lot that researchers don't know about the fate of deciduous boreal forests in a warmer world.""As mature deciduous trees die, will they be replaced with trees with the same structure, composition, and carbon storage abilities?"" Alexander asked. ""And will they recover from fire with the same carbon storage capacities?""""Shifts from slow-growing black spruce to fast-growing deciduous species could balance out the impacts of the intensifying fire regime in the boreal forest,"" said Isla Myers-Smith, a global change ecologist at University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study. ""But it remains to be seen how carbon gains balance losses in future with accelerated warming at high latitudes.""Mack said continued climate warming may undo the carbon-sequestering gains these trees represent. ""The carbon should reside longer on the landscape because deciduous forests are less flammable. But flammability isn't a constant. The climate will pass a threshold where things get so hot and dry, even deciduous forests will burn. So, one question we need to ask is, how strong will the mitigating effect of low flammability be, and how long will it last?""Permafrost carbon also complicates the picture. Though many of the sites in this study did not have permafrost near the soil surface, the permanently frozen ground is found across the boreal biome. As it thaws, permafrost releases stores of carbon and methane, potentially offsetting the storage gains by deciduous trees, Mack said. ""We will eventually pass a temperature threshold where negative feedbacks aren't enough.""",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from Northern Arizona University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Auburn University, and the University of Saskatchewan studied the recovery of black spruce forests after the 2004 fire season in Alaska.

They generated nearly 1,000 ocean metagenomes from 930 locations around the globe, with an average distance between collection points at 26.5 kilometers (about 16.5 miles).In a study published today in ""Phytoplankton are foundational to the marine food web, and they are responsible for as much as half of global carbon dioxide fixation on an ongoing basis, so the health and distribution of these organisms is very important,"" said senior co-author Adam Martiny, UCI professor of Earth system science. ""The knowledge gained on these voyages will help climatologists make more sound predictions about the role of phytoplankton in regulating carbon stocks in the atmosphere and ocean.""Since microbial phytoplankton live in large populations and have rapid life cycles, the researchers suggest that changes in community composition and genomic content can provide an early warning about environmental transformations and do so far faster than by merely analyzing ocean physics and chemistry.""Nitrogen, phosphorus and iron limitation in many surface ocean regions is nearly impossible to detect through chemical analysis of water samples; the quantities of these elements are just too low,"" said lead author Lucas Ustick, a UCI graduate student in ecology & evolutionary biology. ""But quantifying shifts in Prochlorococcus genes involved in the uptake of major nutrients, and combinations thereof, provides a strong indicator of the geography of nutrient stress.""The authors pointed out that all Prochlorococcus genomes include a certain gene that allows phytoplankton to directly assimilate the inorganic phosphate freely available in seawater. But when this compound is in short supply, phytoplankton adapt by gaining a gene that enables the cells to take up dissolved organic phosphorus, which can be detected in their genome.The researchers also studied numerous other examples of genetic adaptations for differing levels of phosphorus, iron and nitrogen in the environment to see what sorts of trade-offs the phytoplankton are continuously making. What resulted is a global map of nutrient stress. The researchers also were able to identify regions where phytoplankton experience co-stress involving two or more elements, one of them almost always being nitrogen.The team's work revealed the North Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea to be regions of elevated phosphorus stress. Genotypes adapted to nitrogen stress are widespread in so-called oligotrophic regions where nutrients are low and oxygen is high, and research sampling results suggest widespread adaptation to iron stress.Analysis of phytoplankton genotypes confirmed known biogeographic patterns of nutrient stress estimated by different techniques, but it also revealed previously unknown regions of nutrient stress and co-stress. The researchers had a scant understanding of nutrient stress in the Indian Ocean prior to their metagenomic analysis, but their work helped to fill in many blanks. They now know the Arabian Sea upwelling region to be an area of some iron stress, and they detected phosphorus stress associated with to south-flowing ocean currents, among many other findings.Still, they say, there is always more to learn.""Our work highlights gaps in our measurements of high-latitude environments, in most of the Pacific Ocean, and in deeper-water ecosystems,"" said co-first author Alyse Larkin, UCI postdoctoral scholar in Earth system science.

The answer lies in filtering wastewater with a gel material taken from plant cellulose and spiked with small carbon dots produced in a microwave oven.","Reporting in the journal Minna Hakkarainen, who leads the Division of Polymer Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, says that the hydrogels remove contaminants such as heavy metal ions, dyes and other common pollutants.""The total amount of water on Earth doesn't change with time, but demand does,"" she says. ""These all-lignocellulose hydrogels offer a promising, sustainable solution to help ensure access to clean water.""The hydrogel composites can be made from 100 percent lignocellulose, or plant matter -- the most abundant bioresource on Earth, she says.One ingredient is cellulose gum (carboxymethyl cellulose, or CMC), a thickener and emulsion derived commonly from wood pulp or cotton processing byproducts and used in various food products, including ice cream. Added to the hydrogel are graphene oxide-like carbon dots synthesized from biomass with the help of microwave heat. The hydrogel composites are then cured with UV light, a mild process that takes place in water at room temperature.Hydrogels consist of a network of polymer chains that not only absorb water, but also collect molecules and ions by means of electrostatic interactions -- a process known as adsorption. Hakkarainen says the new process also reinforces the stability of the hydrogel composites so that they can outlast ordinary hydrogels for repeated cycles of water purification.Graphene oxide has become a favored additive to this mix, because of its high adsorption capacity, but the environmental cost of graphene oxide production is high.""Graphene oxide is a great adsorbent, but the production process is harsh,"" she says. ""Our route is based on common bio-based raw materials and significantly milder processes with less impact on the environment.""Graphene is derived from graphite, a crystalline form of carbon that most people would recognize as the ""lead"" in pencils. In oxidized form it can be used in hydrogels but the oxidation process requires harsh chemicals and conditions. Synthesizing graphene from biomass often requires temperatures of up to 1300C.By contrast, the researchers at KTH found a way to carbonize biomass at much lower temperatures. They reduced sodium lignosulfate, a byproduct from wood pulping, into carbon flakes by heating it in water in a microwave oven. The water is brought to 240C, and it is kept at that temperature for two hours.Ultimately after a process of oxidation they produced carbon dots of about 10 to 80 nanometers in diameter, which are then mixed with the methacrylated CMC and treated with UV-light to form the hydrogel.""This is a simple, sustainable system,"" Hakkarainen says.

Because the Earth's vegetation influences climate, climate models frequently include vegetation reconstructions and are often validated by comparisons to the past. Yet such models tend to get oversimplified, glossing over or omitting how people affected the land and its cover.","The absence of such data led to LandCover6k, a project now in its sixth year that includes more than 200 archaeologists, historians, geographers, paleoecologists, and climate modelers around the world.Led by archeologists Kathleen Morrison of the University of Pennsylvania, Marco Madella of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and Nicki Whitehouse of the University of Glasgow, with data expertise from Penn landscape archaeologist Emily Hammer and others, LandCover6k's goal is to aggregate archaeological and historical evidence of land-use systems from four slices of time -- 12,000 years ago, 6,000 years ago, 4,000 years ago, and around the year 1500 -- into a single database that anyone can comprehend and use.The project offers what the researchers hope will become a tool to improve predictions about the planet's future, plus fill in gaps about its past. ""Understanding the human impact on the Earth is more than looking at past vegetation. It's also important to understand how humans used the land and in particular, the relationship between human land use and vegetation,"" Morrison says.Though current Earth system models suggest that human activity during the past 12,000 years influenced regional and global climate, Madella says, ""the models do not capture the diversity and intensity of human activities that affected past land cover, nor do they capture carbon and water cycles.""Archaeology provides important information around land use that ""helps reveal how humans have affected past land cover at a global scale,"" adds Whitehouse, ""including the crops and animals being farmed, how they were being farmed, and how much land was needed to feed growing populations.""In a new To share such data meant first creating a common language that scientists across disciplines could understand. It's a task more fraught than it might sound, Morrison says. ""Classification means putting hard edges on something. That's very challenging, as archaeologists are often much more comfortable with narrative.""Partially because of a lack of shared terminology, archaeologists have not tried to aggregate and compare data on a global scale, something the project's paleoecologists and modelers had already been doing, she adds. ""We spent years consulting with colleagues around the world, discussing all the different types of land use and developing a communication system -- the same language, the same terminology -- that could be used anywhere.""Because such categories historically have had different meaning depending on place, context, and time period, some archaeologists initially balked at committing to single definitions for each. Hammer offers the concept of ""farming"" as an example. ""The line between what is called 'farming' and what is considered small-scale food production by hunter-gatherers really varies across the world,"" she says. So, how could the field fairly judge when the actions of hunter-gatherers managing wild plant and animal resources became ""farming""?Questions like these prompted the LandCover6k team to create a hierarchy within the classification system, with an upper-level category capturing an idea at its broadest and several distinct sub-categories funneling down from there. In the farming example, the research team created a sub-group -- low-level food production -- which could include the work of the hunter-gatherers. The hope was to offer enough nuance for the archeological community yet still make the data accessible to climate modelers.In addition to this flexible hierarchy and the uniform terminology, the final classification has three other principal features. It is scale- and source-independent, meaning it accounts for the myriad ways something can be studied. It ""takes the perspective of land rather than people,"" as the researchers write in PLOS ONE, and it employs a consistent 8x8 kilometer grid scale. ""That's quite large, from an archaeological perspective,"" Hammer says, ""but we did that so that one person isn't drawing something very small and another person very large.""To showcase how the classification works, the researchers offer the example of the Middle East 6,000 years ago. This region, the area represented by modern day Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen, was home to some of the earliest agriculture in the world. Using the new classification and database, project participants built a regional land-use map, despite data availability differing from one spot to the next.""Mesopotamia has been studied since the mid-19th century so there's a lot of data and a lot of syntheses to rely on,"" Hammer explains. ""Arabia has not been nearly as well-studied. There are only a couple of data points, particularly for this period, and because of climatic events, the data are even rarer than for other periods. We wanted to illustrate the approach you would take in a situation where you have a lot of data versus a place with just a little."" The new map of Middle Eastern land is proof of concept for the project, showing the contrast between the settled farms of Mesopotamia and the more sparsely settled lands of Arabia.The researchers don't see information gaps, like those of Arabia, as problematic. Rather because the land-use database also records data coverage and quality, it can highlight areas needing more research. ""Humans have transformed landscapes for thousands of years,"" Morrison says. ""But we can't just say that. We have to demonstrate it.""And that's just what LandCover6k aims to do, merging what archaeologists have gleaned about human land use from different times and places into a single, accessible database for climate modelers -- and each other. ""This project is really about translating what we do,"" Hammer says, ""not only about the standardization of the terminology so we can talk at a global scale, but also about weaving together the narratives of the past.""",Climate,2021.0,"The LandCover6k project, led by archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and the University of Glasgow, aims to create a comprehensive database of archaeological and historical evidence of land-use systems from four different time periods.

However, ocean temperatures in the warm periods 450,000 years ago were much colder and CO""To understand how the climate system's heat balance is changing,"" says Hubertus Fischer, ""we have to understand the ocean first and foremost."" For example, 93 percent of the additional heat that humans accumulate by increasing greenhouse gases is currently stored in the ocean rather than in the atmosphere. This means that without the ocean's heat uptake, the temperature increase measured on land due to human-induced climate change would be significantly greater. However, because the oceans have a huge mass compared to the atmosphere, the temperature changes measured in the ocean today are very small.The relevance of data from the ocean for climate research is demonstrated by the international ARGO project, a mobile observation system for the world's oceans with which for example continuous temperature measurements down to a depth of 2,000 meters have been carried out since 2000. Roughly 4,000 drifting buoys distributed over all oceans are used for this. This makes the approach of Bern's researchers all the more astonishing in comparison: ""We only need a single polar ice sample for our mean ocean temperature measurement,"" explains Hubertus Fischer, ""of course we are nowhere near the accuracy of ARGO, but conversely we can look far back into the past."" What is being studied is not frozen seawater, but air bubbles trapped in Antarctica's glacier ice. Specifically: the noble gases argon, krypton, xenon and molecular nitrogen. The majority of these gases are in the atmosphere, just a small fraction is dissolved in the ocean. How well each gas is dissolved in seawater depends on the ocean temperature. Therefore, the changing ratio of these gases in the ice samples can be used to reconstruct past mean ocean temperatures.""The prerequisite for this method are high-precision measurements using a dynamic mass spectrometer,"" emphasizes Hubertus Fischer, ""which were made possible by the great efforts of several doctoral students and postdocs involved in the publication."" Processing and measurement methods developed in Bern as part of the MATRICs project funded by the European Research Council (ERC) are also crucial. Past ocean temperatures are determined to within 0.4 °C in Bern. This precision makes it possible to trace the climatic ups and downs of the past, since the difference in mean ocean temperature between the ice age and the warm phases over the past 700,000 years was about 3 °C.

This is the result of a new study by an international team of researchers that looked at the peculiar effects climate change has on Africa's largest coffee producing nation. Their results are relevant both for the country's millions of smallholder farmers, who earn more on specialty coffee than on ordinary coffee, as well as for baristas and coffee aficionados around the world.","""Climate change has conflicting impacts on coffee production in Ethiopia. The area that is suitable for average quality coffee might actually increase gradually until the 2090s, according to our computer simulations,"" says lead author Abel Chemura from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). ""Yet more is not necessarily better. Because on the flipside, the suitable area for high quality specialty coffee types which are valued for their floral, fruity and spicy notes, will likely shrink if climate change continues unchecked. This is an issue not just for coffee lovers, but for local agricultural value creation.""Under various scenarios the researchers looked at how a total of 19 climatic factors will affect the cultivation of five distinct specialty coffee types in the future, including mean temperature, annual rainfall levels, and seasonality. For example, if it gets warmer, the coffee cherry matures faster than the development of the bean, which in turn leads to coffee that is lower in quality. Increased rainfall, on the other hand, favors coffee production in general but may be not necessarily beneficial for individual specialty coffee types.Thus, while the researchers project that the area suitable for four out of five specialty coffee types will decline, some are hit harder than others. For example, the renowned Yirgacheffe type, one of the world's oldest and most sought after coffee types cultivated in Ethiopia's southwest, under the worst case scenario, could lose more than 40% of its suitable area by the end of the 21st century.This would not only affect coffee drinkers worldwide, especially those who grind their own beans or prefer sophisticated blends -- it would also have consequences for Ethiopia's economy. ""If one or more coffee regions lose their specialty status due to climate change this has potentially grave ramifications for the smallholder farmers in the region,"" says co-author Christoph Gornott from PIK and the University of Kassel, Germany. ""If they were forced to switch to growing conventional, less palatable and bitter coffee types, they would all of the sudden compete with industrial production systems elsewhere that are more efficient. For the country, in which coffee exports account for roughly a third of all agricultural exports, this could prove fatal.""However, there may be ways to stop this trend. ""As distinct specialty coffee types are strongly influenced by different local climatic, spatial and soil-related factors, what is needed are adaptation measures that are tailored to each specific region,"" adds Christoph Gornott.

""Hereby we were also able to confirm previous studies but find that global warming is increasing monsoon rainfall in India even more than previously thought.

As co-author Julia Pongratz from LMU explains: ""Crops need water especially in the initial growing period, but too much rainfall during other growing states can harm plants -- including rice on which the majority of India's population is depending for sustenance. This makes the Indian economy and food system highly sensitive to volatile monsoon patterns.""A look into the past underlines that human behavior is behind the intensification of rainfall. Starting in the 1950s, human-made forcings have begun to overtake slow natural changes occurring over many millennia. At first, high sun-light blocking aerosol loadings led to subdued warming and thus a decline in rainfall, but since then, from 1980 onwards, greenhouse gas-induced warming has become the deciding driver for stronger and more erratic Monsoon seasons.""We see more and more that climate change is about unpredictable weather extremes and their serious consequences,"" comments group leader and co-author Anders Levermann from PIK and Columbia University, New York/USA on the findings of the study published in the journal ",Climate,2021.0,"Global warming is causing monsoon rainfall in India to increase more than previously believed, according to a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

The climate was warm, but drier than today. There were large populations of Indigenous people known as the Fremont, a who hunted and grew crops in the area. With similar climate and moderate human activity, you might expect to see the types of wildfires that are now common to the American West: infrequent, gigantic and devastating. But you'd be wrong.","In a new study led by the University of Utah, researchers found that the Fremont used small, frequent fires, a practice known as cultural burning, which reduced the risk for large-scale wildfire activity in mountain environments on the Fish Lake Plateau -- even during periods of drought more extreme and prolonged than today.The researchers compared lake sediment, tree ring data and archaeological evidence to reconstruct a 1,200 history of fire, climate, and human activity of the Fish Lake Plateau, a high-elevation forest in central Utah in the United States. They found that frequent fires occurred between the years 900 and 1400, a period of intense farming activity in the region. Prehistoric cooking hearths and pollen preserved in lake sediment show that edible plant species dominated the landscape during this period, indicating that Fremont people practiced cultural burning to support edible wild plants, including sunflowers, and other crops. Large-scale farming ceased after the year 1400. Hunters and foragers, ancestors of the Ute and Paiute, continued to burn, although less frequently than during the farming period. After Europeans made cultural burning illegal, the ecosystem returned to be dominated by a thick forest of trees.""When you have people burning frequently, they're reducing the amount of surface fuels present on the landscape. It makes it much more difficult for a lightning fire to reach up to the canopy and burn down the entire forest,"" said Vachel Carter, postdoctoral research assistant at the U and lead author of the study. ""Now we have an environment dominated by trees in a very dry environment, which are conditions prime for megafires. Is this a result of climate change? Definitely. But in the case at Fish Lake, it could also be attributed to a lack of cultural burning.""For millennia through the present, Indigenous people across North America have used cultural burning to drive game, ease travel, clear vegetation for fields and enhance regrowth of edible plants. European settlers banned the practice in favor of fire suppression, the strategy that's dominated forest management since the turn of the 20th century.""All over North America, humans have always modified fire regimes to benefit themselves and their families,"" said Brian Codding, associate professor of anthropology at the U and senior author of the paper. ""Cultural burning is something that needs to be considered when people are talking about how to manage forests, just like in the Fish Lake National Forest.""The paper published April 14, 2021 in the Nature journal The study is the first in the region to combine charcoal, pollen, tree ring and archeological site data together to assess human influence on prehistoric wildfires. The multiple disciplines allowed the researchers to make connections that would otherwise have been impossible.""This is really showing us something that's kind of invisible otherwise,"" said Codding. ""People have been trying to look at human impacts on fire regimes all over the place, and it's really hard. Because the changes might be really subtle, or our records just aren't fine-grained enough to record the types of changes that can reveal it.""Colleagues from Utah State University and Brigham Young University contributed tree ring data that document how the climate has shifted over time. Thick rings mean that the tree grew rapidly, indicating there was more moisture available. Narrow rings represent a slow growth year due to less moisture, a signature that can record periods of drought. For this study, they established a climatological timeline for the Fish Lake area.Carter analyzed the contents of ancient sediments to reconstruct past worlds. Detritus from the local environment blows over the lake and settles at the bottom, building up layers as time passes. Each layer provides a snapshot of what the surrounding area was like at a particular time. She used charcoal as a proxy for fire abundance -- more charcoal means more frequent fire -- and analyzed pollen grains to determine what plant species dominated and compared how those changed over the last 1,200 years.Codding and colleagues counted the number of sites that were occupied, using radiocarbon dates on items found at dwelling sites to establish when people were there. They also used food remnants in cooking hearths to establish the types of food people were eating. They analyzed sites within modern day Sevier County, the area around and including Fish Lake, the ancestral lands of the Ute and Paiute Tribes.""From the cooking hearths found at Fish Lake, we got an indication of what people were eating, and when they were eating it. We knew that they were eating food in the sunflower family, the grass family, and the sedge family, all these plants that don't naturally dominate a high elevation forest,"" said Carter. ""I counted the pollen from those species in the sediment cores and, sure enough, when the Fremont were present, those same plant species were present in much higher abundances than when the Fremont were absent.""""This piece really pulls the study together for linking how people living at this area, at higher densities, were actually modifying the environment to increase the resources that were available to them,"" Codding said.In Utah, many forests could benefit from frequent, smaller fires to mitigate wildfire risk. Perhaps one of the most urgent is in the Fish Lake National Forest that guards Pando, a stand of 47,000 aspen tree clones and the most massive organism on Earth. Pando has sat at the south end of Fish Lake for thousands of years, at least -- some say the organism is a million years old. In recent years, the beloved grove has been shrinking. Low severity fires may help Pando, and other Utah forests, stay healthy.""Fuels on the Fish Lake landscape are at the highest that they've been in the last 1,200 years. The climate is much warmer than it was in the past. Our droughts have not been as intense as we've seen in the past, but they're on their way,"" Carter said.

They found that during the ""Beast from the East,"" open-water conditions in the Barents Sea supplied up to 88% of the corresponding fresh snow that fell over Europe.""What we're finding is that sea-ice is effectively a lid on the ocean. And with its long-term reduction across the Arctic, we're seeing increasing amounts of moisture enter the atmosphere during winter, which directly impacts our weather further south, causing extreme heavy snowfalls. It might seem counter-intuitive, but nature is complex and what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic."" says Bailey.When analyzing the long-term trends from 1979 onwards, researchers found that for every square meter of winter sea-ice lost from the Barents Sea, there was a corresponding 70 kg increase in the evaporation, moisture, and snow falling over Europe.Their findings indicate that within the next 60 years, a predicted ice-free Barents Sea will likely become a significant source of increased winter precipitation -- be it rain or snow -- for Europe.""This study illustrates that the abrupt changes being witnessed across the Arctic now, really are affecting the entire planet."" says professor Hubbard.",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study led by Dr. Hanna Bailey at the University of Oulu reveals a direct connection between the decline of Arctic sea-ice since the late 1970s and a severe winter weather event in Europe known as the ""Beast from the East"" in 2018.

Road salt is an important tool for safety, because many thousands of people die or are injured every year due to weather related accidents. But a new study led by Sujay Kaushal of the University of Maryland warns that introducing salt into the environment -- whether it's for de-icing roads, fertilizing farmland or other purposes -- releases toxic chemical cocktails that create a serious and growing global threat to our freshwater supply and human health.","Previous studies by Kaushal and his team showed that added salts in the environment can interact with soils and infrastructure to release a cocktail of metals, dissolved solids and radioactive particles. Kaushal and his team named these cascading effects of introduced salts Freshwater Salinization Syndrome, and it can poison drinking water and cause negative effects on human health, agriculture, infrastructure, wildlife and the stability of ecosystems.Kaushal's new study is the first comprehensive analysis of the complicated and interconnected effects caused by Freshwater Salinization Syndrome and their impact on human health. This work suggests that the world's freshwater supplies could face serious threats at local, regional and global levels if a coordinated management and regulation approach is not applied to human sources of salt. The study, which calls on regulators to approach salts with the same level of concern as acid rain, loss of biodiversity and other high-profile environmental problems, was published April 12, 2021, in the journal ""We used to think about adding salts as not much of a problem,"" said Kaushal, a professor in UMD's Department of Geology and Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center. ""We thought we put it on the roads in winter and it gets washed away, but we realized that it stuck around and accumulated. Now we're looking into both the acute exposure risks and the long-term health, environmental, and infrastructure risks of all these chemical cocktails that result from adding salts to the environment, and we're saying, 'This is becoming one of the most serious threats to our freshwater supply.' And it's happening in many places we look in the United States and around the world.""When Kaushal and his team compared data and reviewed studies from freshwater monitoring stations throughout the world, they found a general increase in chloride concentrations on a global scale. Chloride is the common element in many different types of salts like sodium chloride (table salt) and calcium chloride (commonly used for road salt). Drilling down into data from targeted regions, they also uncovered a 30-year trend of increasing salinity in places like the Passaic River in northern New Jersey and a 100-mile-plus stretch of the Potomac River that supplies drinking water to Washington, D.C.The major human-related salt source in areas such the Northeastern U.S. is road salts, but other sources include sewage leaks and discharges, water softeners, agricultural fertilizers and fracking brines enriched with salts. In addition, indirect sources of salts in freshwater include weathering roads, bridges and buildings, which often contain limestone, concrete or gypsum, all of which release salt as they break down. Ammonium-based fertilizers can also lead to the release of salts in urban lawns and agricultural fields. In some coastal environments, sea-level rise can be another source of saltwater intrusion.The study points to a growing body of research from around the world that shows how chemical cocktails released by all of these salt sources harm both natural and built environments. For example, changes in salt levels can allow invasive, more salt-tolerant species to take over a stream. Chemical cocktails released by salts can change the microbes in soil and water, and because microbes are responsible for decay and replenishment of nutrients in an ecosystem, that shift can lead to even more changes in the release of salts, nutrients and heavy metals into the environment.In the built environment, salts can degrade roadways and infrastructure. They can also corrode water pipes causing the release of heavy metals into drinking water supplies as they did in Flint, Michigan.""I am greatly surprised by the increasing scope and intensity of these problems as highlighted from our studies,"" said study co-author Gene E. Likens, founding president emeritus of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and a distinguished research professor at the University of Connecticut. ""Increased salinization of surface waters is becoming a major environmental problem in many places in the world.""The variety of sources and complex interactions between salt and the environment are poorly understood, and every lake, stream and aquifer presents a different set of management challenges. The study suggests that management strategies must evaluate salt contributions from different sources on a watershed-ecosystem level and prioritize regulation accordingly, much the way nutrient loads in watersheds are currently managed.Improvements in technology have helped reduce nutrient runoff, but safe and effective alternatives to road salts do not yet exist. Kaushal hopes that regulation, new technologies and a coordinated management approach can reduce the potential threats of Freshwater Salinization Syndrome on a broad scale.""Ultimately, we need regulation at the higher levels, and we're still lacking adequate protection of local jurisdictions and water supplies,"" Kaushal said. ""We have made dramatic improvements to acid rain and air quality, and we're trying to address climate change this way. What we need here is a much better understanding of the complicated effects of added salts and regulations based on that. This can allow us to avert a really difficult future for freshwater supplies.""Going forward, the study emphasizes the importance of increasing water monitoring efforts and using modern sensor technology to capture continuous data. High-frequency sensor data allows scientists and managers to detect peaks in salinity and water flow that may eventually help them to predict the chemical composition and accumulation of toxins due to Freshwater Salinization Syndrome.In addition, Kaushal said field studies and experiments that trace the rapidly expanding effects of salt in the environment are needed to improve scientific understanding of the problem.

This surprising consequence of climate change could affect the survival of fish species in the Arctic's offshore waters.,"The study's researchers discovered that thawing permafrost causes groundwater to run deeper, where it becomes cooler than when it flows near the soil surface.Rising global temperatures are causing frozen Arctic soil -- permafrost -- to thaw. In a new study, researchers have discovered something surprising: small rivers, creeks and streams that flow into larger lakes and coastal waters seem be to getting colder as permafrost melts. The phenomenon was previously documented in Russian rivers in the Arctic. But until now, no one had studied why the water was getting colder, even as air temperatures are warming and the permafrost is thawing.Together with researchers from the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center, Associate Professor Ylva Sjöberg of UCPH's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management has shed new light on this cold water. The study's researchers discovered that thawing permafrost causes groundwater to run deeper, where it becomes cooler than when it flows near the soil surface.""Permafrost is found just beneath the ground's surface. When permafrost is intact, groundwater flows from springs and the mountains and atop the permafrost layer, where it is significantly heated throughout summer. However, as permafrost disappears, runoff seeps deeper into the ground, where it cools before making its way into nearby streams, rivers and lakes,"" explains Ylva Sjöberg, the study's lead author.In their study, the researchers studied the Noatak National Preserve in northwest Alaska. As with other Arctic areas, the Noatak is experiencing higher temperature due to climate change.However, very little data is available for how climate change affects the temperature of smaller water flows. The researchers positioned 62 measuring sensors in different streams in areas both with and without permafrost. Here, they observed that water temperatures were warmer in permafrost-covered areas.Using a computer model, the researchers were able to calculate that the summer water temperatures would average 11 degrees in areas of permafrost, while in areas without permafrost, it would be 4 degrees.""We have no reason to believe that our observations in Alaska would be any different in other Arctic regions with analogous landscapes. This complicates the effects of climate change, as it seems that areas with permafrost are not subject to the same simple ratio of temperature increases in air and water as are used elsewhere,"" explains Ylva Sjöberg.Salmon, grayling and sculpin are a few of the fish species that spawn and grow in these streams. Fish biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Alaska Science Center made initial observations of how cooler water temperatures might affect fish.""Stream temperature ultimately determines a fish's ability to reproduce and survive.

Carey, USGS fish biologist.According to the biologists, who are now busy with analysing the study data, thawing permafrost can also introduce other factors that may disturb the aquatic environments of these fish.""Streams draining from areas of thawing permafrost will likely show not only temperature fluctuations but also an increase in carbon and nutrient runoff,"" concludes Carey.",Climate,2021.0,"Thawing permafrost in the Arctic is causing smaller rivers and streams to become colder, according to a study by researchers from the University of Copenhagen and the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center.

Understanding the factors that control how fast glaciers move, break up and deposit chunks of ice (icebergs) into the fjords -- and eventually the sea -- is vital for predicting how the Greenland ice sheet will change under a warming climate and for predicting global rates of sea-level rise.","A new study led by Stockholm University Assistant Professor Christian Stranne, shows that thick sea-ice outside the fjords can actually increase the sensitivity of Greenlandic fjords to warming. Stranne and a team of researchers from Sweden, Greenland, the Netherlands, the USA, and Canada report on expeditions to two distinct fjords in northern Greenland during the 2015 and 2019 summers. ""These fjords were practically inaccessible to researchers until quite recently because the sea-ice was too thick -- they are some of the least-studied areas on the planet, and require a large icebreaker to reach them, even in the summer,"" says Stranne. The inaccessibility and sea-ice build-up is due to the direction of Arctic Ocean currents; the Beaufort Gyre and Transpolar Drift push ice from across the Arctic up against the northern Greenland coast.Writing in In 2019, air temperatures in northern Greenland reached record highs. Despite similar high air temperatures and conditions, Petermann Fjord's near surface sea temperatures never exceeded 0ºC. ""But in the Sherard Osborn Fjord, cut off from the open ocean by thick sea-ice, near surface sea temperatures reached 4ºC -- which was 3ºC higher than any previous seawater measurement north of Greenland,"" explains Stranne.Summertime melt produces a warm freshwater layer floating atop saltier water in the fjord; here the sea-ice barrier trapped this meltwater inside the fjord. Because of the difference in salt content, the surface water became isolated also from the water below, allowing time for intense solar heating of the fresher surface water. Such warmer water temperatures can contribute to faster melting of the Ryder Glacier in Sherard Osborn Fjord, as well as changing the biogeochemistry in the fjord waters. Conversely, the researchers suggest, that neighboring Petermann Fjord, which was open to the sea during 2015 and 2019, experienced colder surface water temperatures because its surface water was not isolated within the fjord by a sea-ice barrier.These observations are counterintuitive: thick sea-ice is associated with colder climates, yet it can lead to warmer surface water temperatures inside the fjords. For this reason, fjords along the northern Greenland coast are more sensitive to climate warming than fjords without a sea-ice barrier.But each fjord is a little different. Last year, another study from the 2015 and 2019 expeditions pointed out that Ryder Glacier in Sherard Osborn Fjord is less affected by melting of the ice tongue from underneath, compared to Petermann Glacier in Petermann Fjord. In this case the explanation is not sea-ice but the shape of the seafloor that produces a shallower opening to the sea. The physical block of rock and sediment dampens intrusions of deeper warm water from outside the fjord (of Atlantic origin) which tends to make Ryder Glacier less sensitive to climate warming -- while at the same time, surface sea-ice in the adjacent Lincoln Sea can make it more sensitive. ""It's a complex interaction. Overall, we know that warming climate will lead to faster moving glaciers and less ice on Greenland. But how fast this happens, and to what extent, remains a key research topic,"" says Stranne.",Climate,2021.0,"A recent study led by Stockholm University Assistant Professor Christian Stranne reveals that thick sea-ice surrounding Greenlandic fjords can heighten their sensitivity to warming.

""The strategies used to adapt to these impacts have the potential to either improve or exacerbate exposure to hazards, and our modeling results suggest that adaptation policies implemented in response to coastal hazards will have a greater impact on community exposure than the range of variability associated with climate change.""He added that no alternative produced by the model represents a specific forecast for Tillamook County but rather provides a range of results for decision-makers there and in other communities to use to try to limit the uncertainty inherent in climate change adaptation planning.""Implementing policies for which the outcome is less certain might not be as desirable as implementing one that's projected to positively impact one or two important metrics to the stakeholders under all climate scenarios,"" Ruggiero said.

They find that the supply of warm water to the glacier is larger than previously thought, triggering concerns of faster melting and accelerating ice flow.","With the help of the uncrewed submarine Ran that made its way under Thwaites glacier front, the researchers have made a number of new discoveries. Professor Karen Heywood of the University of East Anglia commented:""This was Ran's first venture to polar regions and her exploration of the waters under the ice shelf was much more successful than we had dared to hope. We plan to build on these exciting findings with further missions under the ice next year.""The submersible has, among other things, measured the strength, temperature, salinity and oxygen content of the ocean currents that go under the glacier.Global sea level is affected by how much ice there is on land, and the biggest uncertainty in the forecasts is the future evolution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, says Anna Wåhlin, professor of oceanography at the University of Gothenburg and lead author of the new study now published in Science Advances.The ice sheet in West Antarctica accounts for about ten percent of the current rate of sea level rise; but also the ice in West Antarctica holds the most potential for increasing that rate because the fastest changes worldwide are taking place in the Thwaites Glacier. Due to its location and shape, Thwaites is particularly sensitive to warm and salty ocean currents that are finding their way underneath it.This process can lead to an accelerated melting taking place at the bottom of the glacier and inland movement of the so-called grounding zone, the area where the ice transitions from resting on the seabed to floating in the ocean.Due to its inaccessible location, far from research stations, in an area that is usually blocked by thick sea ice and many icebergs, there has been a great shortage of in situ measurements from this area. This means that there are big knowledge gaps for the ice-ocean boundary processes in this region.In the study, the researchers present the results from the submersible that measured strength, temperature, salinity and oxygen content of the ocean currents that go under the glacier.""These were the first measurements ever performed beneath Thwaites glacier,"" says Anna Wåhlin.The results have been used to map the ocean currents underneath the floating part of the glacier. The researchers discovered that there is a deep connection to the east through which deep water flows from Pine Island Bay, a connection that was previously thought to be blocked by an underwater ridge.The research group has also measured the heat transport in one of the three channels that lead warm water towards Thwaites Glacier from the north. ""The channels for warm water to access and attack Thwaites weren't known to us before the research. Using sonars on the ship, nested with very high-resolution ocean mapping from Ran, we were able to find that there are distinct paths that water takes in and out of the ice shelf cavity, influenced by the geometry of the ocean floor"" says Dr Alastair Graham, University of Southern Florida.The value measured there, 0.8 TW, corresponds to a net melting of 75 km3 of ice per year, which is almost as large as the total basal melt in the entire ice shelf. Although the amount of ice that melts as a result of the hot water is not much compared to other global freshwater sources, the heat transport has a large effect locally and may indicate that the glacier is not stable over time.The researchers also noted that large amounts of meltwater flowed north away from the front of the glacier.Variations in salinity, temperature and oxygen content indicate that the area under the glacier is a previously unknown active area where different water masses meet and mix with each other, which is important for understanding the melting processes at the base of the ice.The observations show warm water approaching from all sides on pinning points, critical locations where the ice is connected to the seabed and give stability to the ice shelf. Melting around these pinning points may lead to instability and retreat of the ice shelf and, subsequently, the upstream glacier flowing off the land. Dr Rob Larter of the British Antarctic Survey commented:""This work highlights that how and where warm water impacts Thwaites Glacier is influenced by the shape of the sea floor and the ice-shelf base as well as the properties of the water itself. The successful integration of new sea-floor survey data and observations of water properties from the Ran missions shows the benefits of the multidisciplinary ethos within the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration.""""The good news is that we are now, for the first time, collecting data that is necessary to model the dynamics of Thwaite's glacier. This data will help us better calculate ice melting in the future.

When certain parts of the climate system changed, other parts of the climate system followed like a series of dominos toppling in succession. This is the conclusion from an analysis of ice-core data by a group of researchers that included postdoc Emilie Capron and associate professor Sune Olander Rasmussen from the Section for the Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, in Denmark. This discovery, just published in the journal ","Understanding abrupt climate changes in the past is critical to our ability to confidently predict whether something similar will occur today or in the near future.Over the last several decades, this has led climate scientists to search for causal relationships of abrupt climate change during the ice age when Greenland temperatures repeatedly rose by as much as 16 degrees Celsius in just decades before slowly falling back to normal ice-age levels.""Many studies have tried to answer this long-standing question: Which part of the climate system changed first when these approximately 30 abrupt climate changes, called Dansgaard-Oeschger events, began? Was it, for example, the ocean currents in the North Atlantic, the wind and rainfall patterns in the Northern Hemisphere, or the spread of sea ice in the Arctic that triggered climate change?"" says ice-core scientist Emilie Capron from the Niels Bohr Institute (University of Copenhagen) and the Institute of Environmental Geosciences (CNRS/Université Grenoble Alpes/IRD/Grenoble INP), who led the study now published in This new analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse set of dynamics within the Dansgaard-Oeschger events. The same physical processes changed together like a row of cascading dominoes, but surprisingly, neither the rate of change nor the order of the processes were the same from one event to the other.The team of researchers used data from two parallel Greenland ice cores that spanned the last ice age to create an image of a typical Dansgaard-Oeschger event and to determine in what order the parts of the climate system changed at the onset of the abrupt climate transitions.The goal is to be able to transfer this knowledge of the past to today's climate and use the fingerprint of past climate change as a kind of warning signal for possible abrupt climate changes in the future.The analysis, funded by the EU as a Marie Sk?odowska-Curie Action and from a research grant from the Carlsberg Foundation, showed that changes in different parts of the climate system -- ocean currents, sea-ice and wind patterns -- were so closely intertwined that they likely triggered and reinforced each other, and led to these reoccurring abrupt climate changes.The results led the international team of scientists to compare the ice-core data with new results from climate model simulations of the last ice age developed by co-author Guido Vettoretti, postdoc at the Niels Bohr Institute. This IPCC-class of climate model is the same type as those used to make projections of future climate change. The comparison revealed that the model showed the same type of entangled behaviour of sea ice, strength of ocean currents, and wind and precipitation patterns.This is positive news in that it increases our confidence that these complex models demonstrably capture the physical processes needed to simulate these past abrupt climate changes. However, the result is also worrisome: One of the climate dominoes that could disrupt the entire system during the ice age was the extent of sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic, and the modern extent of sea ice has been declining at a significant rate since the 1980s, highlighting the risk of a similar domino effect due to human-made climate change.Unfortunately, our understanding of the interplay between the many parts of the Earth's climate system is insufficient to allow us to assess the risk of similar occurrences of abrupt climate change in the future.Likewise, following the domino analogy: We do not know to what extent the initial conditions of the dominoes are different in today's climate system compared to the situation during the last ice age.""In any case, the results emphasize the importance of trying to limit climate change by, for example, cutting anthropogenic emissions of CO",Climate,2021.0,"Understanding past abrupt climate changes helps predict future occurrences.

Tolkien","Known as ""the lost years,"" it is a little-understood journey that unfolds over thousands of miles and as much as two decades or more. Now, a Stanford-led study illuminates secrets of the North Pacific loggerhead turtles' epic migration between their birthplace on the beaches of Japan and reemergence years later in foraging grounds off the coast of Baja California. The study, published April 8 in ""For decades, our ability to connect the migratory dots for this endangered species has remained elusive,"" said study lead author Dana Briscoe, who was a research associate at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment during the research and now works at the Cawthron Institute, New Zealand's largest independent marine science organization. ""This work builds on the backbone of exceptional research about these 'lost years,' and for the first time ever we are excited to provide evidence of a 'thermal corridor' to explain a longstanding mystery of one of the ocean's greatest migrants.""Wildlife seekers thrill to the sight of sea turtles, but ship traffic, fishing nets and other perils have been less kind. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists six of the seven sea turtle species as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable.Despite scientific advancements in core habitat use, we still know precious little about the movement of turtles and other long-lived sea creatures between disparate locations. This knowledge gap makes it impossible to effectively assess and protect these species.The researchers wanted to know how and why some loggerheads travel to the western coastline of North America while others remain in the central Pacific Ocean. How is it that some sea turtles -- creatures highly sensitive to temperature -- can cross a frigid zone called the Eastern Pacific Barrier between the two ocean regions that normally stops most creatures in their tracks?To unlock that mystery, the researchers created the largest dataset on satellite-tagged loggerhead sea turtles ever compiled, employed sophisticated remote sensing oceanographic techniques and collected one of the first detailed records of sea turtle aging and stable isotope testing -- a bone analysis that can be used to provide information about an animal's life. The work relied upon decades of research by the international team of scientists.They started by looking at a 15-year study tracking the movements of more than 200 turtles tagged with satellite tracking devices. Six of the turtles caught the researchers' attention because -- unlike their peers -- they made distinct movements toward the North American coast. Adding to the intrigue, the ""sentinels,"" as the researchers called them, made their journey during the early spring months. A look at remotely sensed ocean conditions for the time period showed that the farthest-roaming of the sentinels swam through water significantly warmer than their peers had confronted on their travels.A bigger picture analysis involved identifying the years loggerheads arrived in Baja California by measuring stable isotope ""fingerprints"" in the bones of sea turtles stranded on beaches there. Because like us, turtles are what they eat, these stable isotope signatures can reveal when the turtles transitioned from the open sea to the coast. The analysis showed significantly greater annual numbers of eastward-bound sea turtles during warm ocean conditions.The likely cause, according to the researchers: the development of a ""thermal corridor"" from unusually warm sea surface temperatures due to El Niño and other intermittent warming conditions that allowed the turtles to cross the Eastern Pacific Barrier to coastal foraging grounds.The corridor was present during the late spring and summer, and was also preceded by early warming of temperatures in the months before it opened. Such anomalous conditions, especially if sustained for several months, may provide key environmental cues to sea turtles and other animals concentrated in the eastern edge of the central Pacific that the thermal corridor is opening. Studies combining data from loggerhead aerial surveys, at-sea-sightings, stranding records and tissue samples supported the hypothesis.The phenomenon may be part of a trend. As the planet undergoes unprecedented climate changes, locations once considered impassable obstacles to species movements, like the Eastern Pacific Barrier, are being redefined. This, in turn, is shifting the distributions and migratory pathways of creatures ranging from sea birds to white sharks and presenting new conservation challenges.For the North Pacific loggerhead, the trend could mean higher exposure to bycatch -- unintentional fisheries harvest -- off the Baja California coast and other potentially important North American foraging grounds, including the Southern California Bight. The study provides important insights, such as an understanding of how animal movements relate to climate variation, that could help predict when sea turtles and other protected species could be vulnerable to such threats.The researchers caution that their multi-year dataset represents only a snapshot of an important developmental period for sea turtles. The small number of turtles that moved into the eastern North Pacific limits the ability to fully test the study's hypothesis under varying conditions. To do that, the researchers call for more satellite tagging and stable isotope studies of turtle bones in this region.""Understanding how and why species like the North Pacific loggerhead move among habitats is crucial to helping them navigate threats,"" said study senior author Larry Crowder, the Edward Ricketts Provostial Professor at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station.

Limiting temperature rise to 2°C rather than 4°C would halve the area at risk and potentially avoid significant sea level rise.The researchers also identified Larsen C -- the largest remaining ice shelf on the peninsula, which split to form the enormous A68 iceberg in 2017 -- as one of four ice shelves that would be particularly threatened in a warmer climate.Dr Ella Gilbert, a research scientist in the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said: ""Ice shelves are important buffers preventing glaciers on land from flowing freely into the ocean and contributing to sea level rise. When they collapse, it's like a giant cork being removed from a bottle, allowing unimaginable amounts of water from glaciers to pour into the sea.""We know that when melted ice accumulates on the surface of ice shelves, it can make them fracture and collapse spectacularly. Previous research has given us the bigger picture in terms of predicting Antarctic ice shelf decline, but our new study uses the latest modelling techniques to fill in the finer detail and provide more precise projections.""The findings highlight the importance of limiting global temperature increases as set out in the Paris Agreement if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, including sea level rise.""The new study, published in the Ice shelf vulnerability from this fracturing process was forecast under 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C global warming scenarios, which are all possible this century.Ice shelves are permanent floating platforms of ice attached to areas of the coastline and are formed where glaciers flowing off the land meet the sea.Every summer, ice at the surface of the ice shelf melts and trickles down into small air gaps in the snow layer below, where it refreezes. However, in years when there is a lot of melting but little snowfall, the water pools on the surface or flows into crevasses, deepening and widening them until the ice shelf eventually fractures and collapses into the sea. If there is water collecting on the surface of the ice shelf, that suggests it could be vulnerable to collapse in this way.This is what happened to the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, which fractured following several years of warm summer temperatures. Its collapse caused the glaciers behind the ice shelf to speed up, losing billions of tonnes of ice to the sea.The researchers identified the Larsen C, Shackleton, Pine Island and Wilkins ice shelves as most at-risk under 4°C of warming, due to their geography and the significant runoff predicted in those areas.Dr Gilbert said: ""If temperatures continue to rise at current rates, we may lose more Antarctic ice shelves in the coming decades.""Limiting warming will not just be good for Antarctica -- preserving ice shelves means less global sea level rise, and that's good for us all.""",Climate,2021.0,"A study led by the University of Reading reveals that 34% of all Antarctic ice shelves, covering approximately half a million square kilometers, would be at risk of destabilization under 4°C of warming. Limiting temperature rise to 2°C could halve the area at risk and potentially prevent significant sea level rise. The Larsen C ice shelf, which produced the A68 iceberg in 2017, is identified as one of the four most threatened ice shelves.

These events are becoming both more frequent and more intense and are best studied together, rather than in isolation, according to new research.","""We found that concurrent extreme hydroclimate events, such as high temperatures and unseasonable rain that quickly melt mountain snowpack to cause downstream floods, are projected to increase and intensify within several critical regions of the Colorado River basin,"" said Katrina Bennett, a hydrologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and lead author of the paper in the journal Another example of concurrent hydroclimate events might be low precipitation accompanied by high temperatures, which cause drought as an impact. Other factors such as low soil moisture or wildfire burn scars on steep slopes contribute to impacts.""You never have just a big precipitation event that causes a big flood,"" Bennett said. ""It results from a combination of impacts, such as fire, topography, and whether it was a wet or dry summer. That's the way we need to start thinking about these events.""The Los Alamos study looked heat waves, drought, flooding, and low flows in climate scenarios taken from six earth-system models for the entire Colorado River basin. The basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California.Using indicators such as maximum temperature, maximum precipitation, dry days, maximum and minimum streamflow, maximum and minimum soil moisture, and maximum evapotranspiration, the team ran the models for a historical period (1970-1999) and a projected future period (2070-2099). They studied the difference between the two periods (future minus historical) for events at four time scales: daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual.Overall, precipitation across the Colorado increased by 2.1 millimeters between the future and historical periods, with some models showing increases in precipitation and some showing decreases. Nonetheless, the team found that in all cases, precipitation changes still drove an increase in concurrent extreme events.Unsurprisingly, temperature increased across all six models and was an even stronger catalyst of events. Consistently across the entire basin, the study found an average temperature rise of 5.5 degrees Celsius between the future and historical periods.In every scenario, the number and magnitude of each type of extreme event increased on average across the Colorado River Basin for the future period compared to the historical period. These numbers were given as a statistical expression of the change in frequency between the historical and future period, not as a count of discrete events.Those increases have significant social, economic, and environmental implications for the entire region, which is a major economic engine for the United States. The study identified four critical watersheds in the Colorado basin -- the Blue River basin, Uncompahgre, East Taylor, Salt/Verde watersheds -- that are home to important water infrastructures, water resources, and hydrological research that would be particularly vulnerable to extreme events in the future.More than 40 million people depend on the Colorado River basin for water, and it directly supports $1.4 trillion in agricultural and commercial activity -- roughly one thirteenth of the U.S. economy, according to 2014 figures.In Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, flooding, drought, freezing events, wildfire, severe storms, and winter storms have cost approximately $40 billion between 1980-2020.This work was funded by the Early Career Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program at Los Alamos National Laboratory.",Climate,2021.0,"A study led by Los Alamos National Laboratory reveals that concurrent extreme hydroclimate events, such as high temperatures and unseasonable rain causing floods, are projected to increase and intensify in critical regions of the Colorado River basin.

The team focused on a specific proposed SRM strategy -- referred to as stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI)) -- to create a sulfate aerosol cloud in the stratosphere to reduce a portion of incoming sunlight and radiation. In theory, this cloud could be controlled in size and location.SAI is like placing tiny reflective particles in the atmosphere to bounce a portion of the solar radiation back to space, so that some of the radiation does not reach -- and warm -- Earth.The team emphasizes that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions must be the priority.""We are just starting to consider the risks and benefits of geoengineering, and it's critical that we include ecosystems in cost-benefit studies,"" said Hellmann, director at the U of M Institute on the Environment. ""We should only pursue geoengineering if its benefits strongly outweigh its downsides. Because our efforts to stem climate change are modest and slow, the case for considering geoengineering is growing, and this paper represents the ecologists chiming in to the geoengineering conversation.""The complexity of cascading relationships between ecosystems and climate under SAI -- in combination with the timing, amount, length and termination of SAI scenarios -- means that SAI is not a simple thermostat that turns down the heat a couple of degrees. Other potential effects of SAI include shifts in rainfall and increases in surface UV rays. While SAI might cool an overheated Earth, it would not be able to counter all of the effects of rising atmospheric CO2, such as halting ocean acidification.""When we approach complex questions like these, there is a broad scale, theoretical understanding of the inherent patterns of biodiversity across the surface of Earth, but this understanding is often informed by finer-scale experiments that test the biological and physical mechanisms underlying those patterns,"" said Phoebe Zarnetske, study co-lead and an associate professor in Michigan State University's Department of Integrative Biology and the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior program.""I hope the paper can convince ecologists that research about nature's responses to solar geoengineering is not just important, but also interesting -- touching on core ecological questions about topics as varied as photosynthesis and animal migration,"" said U of M alum Shan Kothari, who contributed to the study during his time at the College of Biological Sciences before going to the University of Montreal.Kothari said that an example of how other scientists can consider the study's findings is to contemplate the unique conditions resulting from solar geoengineering scenarios that may aid or impede the ability for ecosystems to store carbon.

It traps heat far more effectively than carbon dioxide and accounts for 25% of atmospheric warming to date. And much of that methane is coming from aquatic ecosystems, with human activities contributing to the emissions levels, a new paper published in The global contribution and importance of aquatic ecosystems as methane emitters has been underestimated, says Judith Rosentreter, postdoctoral associate at the Yale School of the Environment (YSE) who led the study with a team of 14 researchers worldwide.The study authors reviewed methane fluxes from 15 major natural, human-made, and human-impacted aquatic ecosystems and wetlands, including inland, coastal, and oceanic systems. They found that when methane emissions are combined from these aquatic ecosystems, they are potentially a larger source of methane than direct anthropogenic methane sources, such as agriculture or fossil fuel combustion. Aquatic ecosystems and wetlands contribute at least as much as half of the total methane emissions budget.""An accurate accounting of the sources of methane from aquatic ecosystems, and if they are impacted by human activities, is important to understanding atmospheric methane concentrations,'' says Peter Raymond, professor of ecosystem ecology who co-authored the study.One issue that stood out is how humans have impacted methane emissions from aquatic sources.""Anything human-driven or human-impacted had much higher fluxes than more natural sites,'' says Rosentreter, a Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Hutchinson Fellow.Globally, rice cultivation releases more methane per year than all coastal wetlands, the continental shelf and open ocean combined. Fertilizer runoff causes nutrient-rich lakes and reservoirs to release methane. Coastal aquaculture farms have methane fluxes per area that are 7-430 times higher than from non-converted coastal habitats, such as mangrove forests, salt marshes or seagrasses.But the study notes that there are opportunities to reduce human-impacted emissions with the right management techniques.""The intense methane emissions from aquatic ecosystems offers opportunities for intervention providing potential quick wins in reducing greenhouse emissions, provided the much large role per molecule emitted of methane compared to carbon dioxide,'' says study co-author Carlos M. Duarte, professor at King Abdullah University of Science and?Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia.Fluctuating between flooded and non-flooded conditions in aquaculture farms and rice paddies; restoring tidal flow in degraded coastal wetlands; and reducing nutrient and organic matter in freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and rivers can all help reduce emissions, the study notes.""Reducing methane emissions from aquatic systems will be an important part of stabilizing the Earth's temperature,'' says co-author Bradley Eyre Director, Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry at Southern Cross University in Australia.Bringing awareness to the amount of methane emissions coming from aquaculture and other water systems can help inform new monitoring and measurements that identify where and how methane emissions are being produced and change over time.""With this awareness is also the possibility of helping to keep our waters cleaner,'' Rosentreter says.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study led by Judith Rosentreter from the Yale School of the Environment reveals that methane emissions from aquatic ecosystems have been underestimated.

She was heading east from Columbia, North Carolina, on the flat, low-lying stretch of U.S. Highway 64 toward the Outer Banks. Sticking out of the marsh on one side of the road were not one but hundreds dead trees and stumps, the relic of a once-healthy forest that had been overrun by the inland creep of seawater.","""I was like, 'Whoa.' No leaves; no branches. The trees were literally just trunks. As far as the eye could see,"" said Ury, who recently earned a biology Ph.D. at Duke University working with professors Emily Bernhardt and Justin Wright.In bottomlands throughout the U.S. East Coast, trees are dying off as rising seas and higher storm surges push saltwater farther inland, poisoning soils far from shore.While these ""ghost forests"" are becoming a more common sight in North Carolina's coastal plain, scientists had only a rough idea of their extent. Now, satellite images are providing new answers.In a study published April 4 in the journal The images show that, between 1985 and 2019, 11% of the area's tree cover was taken over by ghost forests. Instead of mirroring the gradual pace of sea level rise, most of this spread occurred abruptly in the wake of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts, which can concentrate salts or send them surging into the region's interior.The study focused on the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, which was established in 1984 to protect the area's unique forested wetlands and the endangered red wolves, red-cockaded woodpeckers and other wildlife that live there.Here, the Duke team is monitoring what Bernhardt and other researchers call ""the leading edge of climate change.""From 1900 to 2000, the sea rose about a foot in this part of coastal North Carolina, faster than the global average. By the end of this century, it could rise two to five feet more.Shrinking shorelines dominate most discussions of sea-level rise, as oceans submerge coastlines and chew away at beachfront property. Yet less talked about is what's happening farther inland.Long before beaches shrink and disappear under the rising sea, seawater starts creeping into low-lying regions.Most of the Alligator River National Wildlife refuge sits less than two feet above sea level, ""which makes it all the more vulnerable to sea level rise,"" Ury said.Add to that the hundreds of miles of ditches and canals that crisscross the region. Built during the mid-1900s to drain water out, they now act as a conduit for seawater -- which is about 400 times saltier than freshwater -- to flow in.With no barriers in the way, seawater gets pushed inland through these channels, leaving its salty fingerprints on the soils. As the salt moves in, it draws water out of plant cells and strips seeds of their moisture, making it harder for new tree seedlings to sprout. Salt-sensitive tree species first fail to reproduce and eventually die off, as freshwater forest turns to salt marsh.Using pictures taken by 430-mile-high Landsat satellites, the team was able to map the spread of ghost forests in the refuge over time.Each pixel in the satellite images represents the wavelengths of light bouncing off the Earth below, in an area on the ground roughly the size of a baseball diamond.The team fed the satellite images to a computer algorithm, which in turn analyzed each pixel and determined whether it was dominated by dominated by pines, hardwoods, shrubs, grassy marsh, open water or dead trees. Any pixel with as many as 20 to 40 visibly dead trees present at once was labeled as ghost forest.The view from space changed over the 35 years of the study.More than three-fourths of the study area was covered in trees in 1985. Since then, even without any logging or development, the refuge has lost more than 46,950 acres of forest, or a quarter of its 1985 tree cover.More than half of these losses occurred in the interior of the refuge, more than a kilometer from any coast, the study revealed.""It's not just the fringe that's getting wetter,"" Ury said.Of the more than 21,000 acres of ghost forest that formed between 1985 and 2019, the most noticeable die-off was in 2012. The area had just endured a five-year drought and then a potent strike by Hurricane Irene in 2011, when a 6-foot wall of seawater was pushed ashore. The storm surge swept across the refuge, cresting over Highway 264, more than 1.2 miles inland from the coast. Within months, entire stands of dying and downed trees were visible from space.What is happening in eastern North Carolina is happening elsewhere, too, the researchers say. In coastal regions across the globe, saltwater is starting to reach areas that haven't seen it before, even reducing crop yields and jeopardizing freshwater aquifers that people rely on for drinking water.The Duke team is collaborating with other researchers to expand their study to other parts of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains, from Cape Cod to Texas.""Because of its geological location, North Carolina is just ahead of other coastal areas in terms of how far sea level rise has progressed,"" Ury said.

Total yearly rainfall has decreased by an average of 0.4 inches over the last half century, while the longest dry period in each year increased from 20 to 32 days across the West, explained co-senior author Joel Biederman, a research hydrologist with the ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center in Tucson, Arizona.""The greatest changes in drought length have taken place in the desert Southwest. The average dry period between storms in the 1970s was about 30 days; now that has grown to 45 days,"" Biederman said.Extreme droughts are also occurring more often in the majority of the West according to historical weather data as there has been an increase in the year-to-year variation of both total rainfall amounts and the duration of dry periods.Biederman emphasized the growing fluctuations in drought and rain patterns as the most significant change.""Consistency of rainfall, or the lack of it, is often more important than the total amount of rain when it comes to forage continuing to grow for livestock and wildlife, for dryland farmers to produce crops, and for the mitigation of wildfire risks,"" Biederman said.The rate of increasing variability of rainfall within each year and between years also appears to be accelerating, with greater portions of the West showing longer drought intervals since 2000 compared to previous years.Notable exceptions to these drought patterns were seen in Washington, Oregon and Idaho and the Northern Plains region of Montana, Wyoming, and the most western parts of North and South Dakota. In these regions, the researchers found some increases in total annual rainfall and decreases in drought intervals. Together, these changes support what models have predicted as a consequence of climate change: a northward shift in the mid-latitude jet stream, which brings moisture from the Pacific Ocean to the western United States, according to Biederman.A critical aspect of this study is the use of actual rainfall data from 337 weather stations spread across the western United States. Biederman contrasted this with the more common use of ""gridded"" data, which relies on interpolations between reporting stations and tends to smooth out some of the variability revealed by this work.""Fangyue Zhang, lead author of the manuscript and a post-doctoral researcher on our team, did the hard, painstaking work of compiling and analyzing data from more than 300 weather stations with complete daily records to reveal these changing drought and rainfall patterns,"" Biederman said.""We were surprised to find widespread changes in precipitation have already occurred across large regions of the West.

UC Riverside researchers have identified a gene that could put the genie back in the bottle.,"Warmer temperatures signal to plants that summer is coming. Anticipating less water, they flower early then lack the energy to produce more seeds, so crop yields are lower. This is problematic as the world's population is expected to balloon to 10 billion, with much less food to eat.""We need plants that can endure warmer temperatures, have a longer time to flower and a longer growth period,"" said UCR botany and plant sciences professor Meng Chen. ""But, to be able to modify plants' temperature responses, you first have to understand how they work. So, that's why identifying this gene that enables heat response is so important.""The work that Chen and his colleagues did to uncover the heat-sensing gene was published this week in the journal They located the first gene, called HEMERA, two years ago. Then they did an experiment to see if they could identify other genes involved in controlling the temperature-sensing process.Ordinarily, plants react to shifts of even a few degrees in weather. For this experiment, the team began with a mutant Arabidopsis plant completely insensitive to temperature, and they modified it to once again become reactive.Examining the genes of this twice-mutated plant revealed the new gene, RCB, whose products work closely with HEMERA to stabilize the heat-sensing function. ""If you knock out either gene, your plant is no longer sensitive to temperature,"" Chen said.Both HEMERA and RCB are required to regulate the abundance of a group of master gene regulators that serve multiple functions, reacting to temperature as well as light, and turning plants green. These proteins are distributed to two different parts of plant cells, the nucleus as well as organelles called chloroplasts.Going forward, Chen says his laboratory will focus on understanding how these two parts of the cell communicate and work together to achieve growth, greening, flowering, and other functions.""When you change light or temperature, genes in both the nucleus and chloroplasts change their expression. We think HEMERA and RCB are involved coordinating gene expression between these two cell compartments,"" Chen said.Ultimately, the goal is to be able to modify temperature response to ensure the future of our food supply.""We were excited to find this second gene,"" Chen said.

""As scientists, we need to understand and predict the positive and negative effects it could have on the natural world, identify key knowledge gaps and begin to predict what impacts it may have on terrestrial, marine and freshwater species and ecosystems if it were adopted in the future.""Conversations in 2018 between Jessica Gurevitch, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University and working group co-lead, and Alan Robock, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University, gave rise to the pioneering group, which is more aware than most that geoengineering Earth's atmosphere is more than just a science fiction scenario.The costs and technology needed to reflect the sun's heat back into space are currently more attainable than other climate intervention ideas like absorbing carbon dioxide from the air. The working group anticipates its discussions and open access paper will encourage an explosion of scientific investigation into how a climate intervention strategy known as solar radiation modification, or SRM, in tandem with greenhouse gas emissions reduction, would affect the natural world.The feasibility of planetary wide SRM efforts hinge on accurate predictions of its myriad outcomes provided by the well-established computer simulations of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, or GeoMIP. The ""While climate models have become quite advanced in predicting climate outcomes of various geoengineering scenarios, we have very little understanding of what the possible risks of these scenarios might be for species and natural systems,"" Gurevitch said. ""Are the risks for extinction, species community change and the need for organisms to migrate to survive under SRM greater than those of climate change, or does SRM reduce the risks caused by climate change?""""Most of the GeoMIP models only simulate abiotic variables, but what about all of the living things that are affected by climate and rely on energy from the sun?"" Zarnetske said, who is also a faculty member of MSU's Ecology, Evolution and Behavior Program. ""We need to better understand the possible impacts of SRM on everything from soil microorganisms to monarch butterfly migrations to marine systems.""Zarnetske's Spatial and Community Ecology Lab, or SpaCE Lab, specializes in predicting how ecological communities respond to climate change across scales from the microcosm to the global, making it uniquely poised to assist the working group in illuminating vital data for future SRM scenarios such as stratospheric aerosol intervention, or SAI, the focus of the paper.SAI would reduce some of the sun's incoming radiation by reflecting sunlight back into space, such as what happens after large volcanic eruptions. Theoretically, it would be possible to continuously replenish the cloud and control its thickness and location to achieve a desired target temperature.But the paper reveals the under researched complexity of cascading relationships between ecosystem function and climate under different SAI scenarios. In fact, the scientists argue that climate change mitigation must continue regardless of whether SRM is adopted, and the question remains whether some or any SRM can be beneficial in addition to decarbonization efforts.""Although SAI may cool Earth's surface to a global temperature target, the cooling may be unevenly distributed, affecting many ecosystem functions and biodiversity,"" Zarnetske said. ""Rainfall and surface ultraviolet radiation would change, and SAI would increase acid rain and would not mitigate ocean acidification.""In other words, SRM is not a magic bullet for solving climate change. Until the working group's efforts inspire new research into the effects of different climate intervention scenarios, SRM is more akin to a shot in the dark.""Participating in this working group has been quite eye-opening for me,"" said Peter Groffman, ecosystem ecologist and professor at the Advanced Science Research Center at the CUNY Graduate Center and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies.

However, wintering bird communities are considerably faster at tracking the changing climate compared to breeding communities.","Climate change is driving species' distribution towards the poles and mountaintops, resulting in changes to bird communities. As a considerable share of birds are migratory species, with the distance they travel varying by species, the rate of change in bird communities is different in the breeding season and in the winter. A new Finnish-led study demonstrates for the first time that changes in bird communities are significantly faster in the winter than in the breeding season.""Climate change is reshaping bird communities so that abundance of southern species increase, while the abundance of northern species is reduced,"" says Senior curator Aleksi Lehikoinen from the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus, which is part of the University of Helsinki.The faster change of bird communities in the winter is most likely results from the birds being less sedentary in their wintering areas than in their breeding areas. Some species are capable of migrating also in mid-winter, if the weather gets colder. In fact, a rise in temperature increased the annual rate of change for wintering bird communities. During the breeding season, individual birds are bound to a specific environment for several months, preventing them from migrating in the middle of breeding even if the weather changes.""In Finland, wintering bird communities in particular have changed due to the rapid increase in abundance of southern species, such as the tufted duck, the blackbird and the goldfinch. As winters become warmer faster than summers, our winter bird communities will continue to change rapidly also in the future,"" Lehikoinen explains.The study examined changes in bird communities in eight countries in Europe as well as in the United States and Canada since the 1980s.

Skilled swimmers, crocodiles can travel long distances and live in freshwater to marine environments. But they can't roam far overland. American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) are found in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of the Neotropics but they arrived in the Pacific before Panama existed, according to researchers from McGill University.","Over 3 million years ago, the formation of the Isthmus of Panama altered global ocean circulation, connecting North and South America and establishing the Caribbean Sea. This resulted in widespread mixing of species on the continent and separation in the seas. On land, mammals from North America such as mammoths, sabre-toothed cats, horses, and camels invaded South America, and strange mammals like giant ground sloths, armadillos, and opossums from South America invaded North America. This event is known as the Great American Interchange, and the opposite happened in the seas, where new species of corals, clams, and fishes evolved in the separated Pacific and Caribbean waters.The question a group of McGill and Panamanian researchers asked was: how distant are the Pacific and Caribbean populations from each other and does it match the geological record? Researchers have long suspected that American crocodiles living on the Pacific coast should have diverged genetically enough from Caribbean populations to become unique species.""We assumed we would detect significant genetic differences between Pacific and Caribbean crocodile populations that were isolated for the past 3 million years,"" thought José Avila-Cervantes, a recent PhD graduate of McGill University under the supervision of Professor Hans Larsson.To test this, Avila-Cervantes captured and took blood samples of crocodiles from several populations living on both coasts of Panama. Back at McGill University, he sequenced their genomes to look for small variations in their DNA. He used the genetic differences to estimate how much evolutionary divergence and gene flow existed between populations. With this information, the team found that Pacific and Caribbean crocodile populations have been separated for only about 100,000 years.""This time of separation is a far cry from the 3 million years we were expecting,"" said Professor Larsson, Director of the Redpath Museum at McGill. ""But it did match the last interglacial period of the Ice Age.""Glacial and interglacial cycles in the Ice Age mark periods of peak polar glaciations separated by relatively warm times. These warm times caused sea levels to rise over 100 meters globally compared to present-day levels. Using the record of Ice Age sea levels, Avila-Cervantes was able to reconstruct what Panama would have looked like during these peak cold and warm periods of the Ice Age.""It surprised us to see that during the warm inter-glacial periods, most of Panama was underwater with the coasts separated by brackish lagoons, small rivers, and thin stretches of land,"" said Avila-Cervantes. ""These are the reasons why we think crocodiles were able to pass from coast to coast freely and explain why their oldest genetic signature of separation coincides with this time."" A second younger signature of genetic separation is timed to about 20,000 years ago and coincides with the last glaciation cycle that they found made Panama about twice as wide as it is today, and probably a good barrier for these crocodiles. ""This is one of the first studies to implicate Ice Age glaciation-interglaciation cycles with the evolution of a tropical organism.""Yet the researchers discovered there is some genetic divergence between the populations on each coast despite the frequent inter-glaciations, and this diversity is at risk due to habitat destruction from human development. ""It was difficult to find any population living on the Pacific coast near the Panama Canal,"" said Avila-Cervantes.One of the best-preserved populations is in the middle of the Panama Canal on the Barro Colorado Island Nature Monument. ""Preserving the population around this island may be our best chance to preserve the unique genetic signatures of Panamanian American crocodiles,"" said Professor Larsson. ""Our study not only highlights the resilience of crocodiles to ancient climate changes and their great capacity to survive large geological events, but also their vulnerability to our voracious need to modify their environments.""",Climate,2021.0,"The formation of the Isthmus of Panama over 3 million years ago led to the Great American Interchange, where species from North and South America mixed on land while separate species evolved in the Pacific and Caribbean seas.

Their paper was published in ""Quantifying the rate at which plants in a given area process CO""Measuring photosynthesis is especially pertinent to agricultural ecosystems, where plant productivity and biomass levels are directly tied to crop yield and therefore food security. Our research directly applies to not only ecosystem service, but also societal well-being,"" said Chongya Jiang, a research scientist on the project.Of particular intrigue is the relevance of GPP monitoring to bioenergy agricultural ecosystems, where the crops' ""factories"" are specially designed to produce renewable biofuels. Quantifying COThe technology used in this experiment is cutting-edge. As its name suggests, it is purely derived from satellite data, and therefore completely observation-based as opposed to relying on complex, uncertain modeling methods.One example of an observation-based technology is solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a weak light signal emitted by plants that has been used as a novel proxy for GPP. Inspired by their years-long ground observations of SIF, Guan's group developed an even more advanced method to improve GPP estimation: integrating a new vegetation index called ""soil-adjusted near-infrared reflectance of vegetation"" (SANIRv) with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).SLOPE is built on this novel integration. SANIRv represents the efficiency of solar radiation used by vegetation, and PAR represents the solar radiation that plants can actually use for photosynthesis. Both metrics are derived from satellite observations.Through an analysis of 49 AmeriFlux sites, researchers found that PAR and SANIRv can be leveraged to accurately estimate GPP. In fact, the SLOPE GPP product can explain 85% of spatial and temporal variations in GPP acquired from the analyzed sites -- a successful result, and the best performance ever achieved benchmarked on this gold-standard data. As both SANIRv and PAR are ""satellite only,"" this is an achievement that researchers have long been seeking but is just now being implemented in an operational GPP product.Existing processes to quantify GPP are inefficient for three key reasons: spatial (image-based) precision, temporal (time-based) precision, and latency (delay in data availability). The SLOPE GPP product created by Guan's team uses satellite images twice as sharp as most large-scale studies (measuring at 250 meters versus the typical >500 meters) and retrieves data on a daily cycle, eight times finer than the norm. More importantly, this new product has between one and three days latency, whereas existing datasets lag behind by months or even years. Finally, the majority of GPP products employed today are analysis- rather than observation-based -- the metrics they use to calculate GPP (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, etc.) are derived from algorithms rather than real-world conditions gleaned from satellite observations.""Photosynthesis, or GPP, is the foundation for quantifying the field-level carbon budget. Without accurate GPP information, quantifying other carbon-related variables, such as annual soil carbon change, is much less reliable,"" Guan said. ""The Blue Waters supercomputer made our peta-bytes computing possible. We will use this novel GPP data to significantly advance our ability to quantify agricultural carbon budget accounting, and it will serve as a primary input to constrain the modeling of soil organic carbon change for every field that requires soil carbon quantification.

We wanted to see how accurate those were and whether we could improve on them.""Mr Hester said their models -- confirmed in experiment -- and the observations of oceanographers show that the sides of icebergs melt about twice as fast as their base. For icebergs that are moving in the ocean, melting at the front can be three or four times faster than what the old models predicted.""The old models assumed that stationary icebergs didn't melt at all, whereas our experiments show melting of about a millimetre every minute,"" Mr Hester said.""In icebergs moving in oceans, the melting on the base can be up to 30 percent faster than in old models.""The research shows that iceberg shape is important.

It accumulates in trees and soil, algae and sediment, microorganisms and seawater.""The ocean is a huge carbon reservoir with the potential to mitigate or enhance global warming,"" said Naomi Levine, senior author of the study and assistant professor in the biological sciences department at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. ""Carbon cycling is critical for understanding global climate because it sets the temperature, which in turn sets climate and weather patterns. By predicting how carbon cycling and storage works, we can better understand how climate will change in the future.""Processes governing how organic matter -- decaying plant and animal matter in the environment akin to the material gardeners add to soil -- accumulates are critical to the Earth's carbon cycle. However, scientists don't have good tools to predict when and how organic matter piles up. That's a problem because a better reconciling of organic carbon can inform computer models that forecast global warming and support public policy.In recent years, scientists have offered three competing theories to explain how organic matter accumulates, and each has its limitations. For example, one idea is some organic matter is intrinsically persistent, similar to an orange peel. Sometimes carbon is too diluted so microbes can't locate and eat it, as if they're trying to find a single yellow jellybean in a jar full of white ones. And sometimes, the right microbe isn't in the right place at the right time to intercept organic matter due to environmental conditions.While each theory explains some observations, the USC study shows how this new framework can provide a much more comprehensive picture and explain the ecological dynamics important for organic matter accumulation in the ocean. The solution has wide utility.For example, it can help interpret data from any condition in the ocean. When linked into a full ecosystem model, the framework accounts for diverse types of microbes, water temperature, nutrients, reproduction rates, sunlight and heat, ocean depth and more. Through its ability to represent diverse environmental conditions worldwide, the model can predict how organic carbon will accumulate in various complex scenarios -- a powerful tool at a time when oceans are warming and the Earth is rapidly changing.""Predicting why organic carbon accumulates has been an unsolved challenge,"" said Emily Zakem, a study co-author and postdoctoral scholar at USC Dornsife. ""We show that the accumulation of carbon can be predicted using this computational framework.""The tool can also potentially be used to model past ocean conditions as a predictor of what may be in store for the Earth as the planet warms largely due to humanmade greenhouse gas emissions.Specifically, the model is capable of looking at how marine microbes can flip the world's carbon balance. The tool can show how microbes process organic matter in the water column throughout a given year, as well as at millennial timescales. Using that feature, the model confirms -- as has been previously predicted -- that microbes will consume more organic matter and rerelease it as carbon dioxide as the ocean warms, which ultimately will increase atmospheric carbon concentrations and increase warming. Moreover, the study says this phenomenon can occur rapidly, in a non-linear way, once a threshold is reached -- a possible explanation for some of the whipsaw climate extremes that occurred in Earth's distant past.""This suggests that changes in climate, such as warming, may result in large changes in organic carbon stores and that we can now generate hypotheses as to when this might occur,"" Levine said.Finally, the research paper says the new tool can model how carbon moves through soil and sediment in the terrestrial environment, too, though those applications were not part of the study.In addition to Zakem and Levine, the study's authors included B.B. Cael of the National Oceanography Centre in England.Funding for the research team comes from the Simons Foundation, Simons Collaboration on Principles of Microbial Ecology (#542389) to Levine; the Simons Postdoctoral Fellowship in Marine Microbial Ecology to Zakem; a National Environmental Research Council grant (#NER015953-1) and a European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program grant (#820989) to Cael.",Climate,2021.0,"A new computational framework has been developed to predict how organic matter accumulates in the ocean.

For instance, rainforests cover less than 2 percent of Earth's total surface, yet they are home to 50 percent of Earth's species. Oceans account for 71 percent of Earth's total surface but contain only 15 percent of Earth's species. What drives this uneven distribution of species on Earth is a major question for scientists.","In a paper published February 16 in the The researchers relied on recently digitized natural history collections to map the diversity of life on earth and build a database of over one million fern specimens with longitude and latitude coordinates occurring all over the world. After an extensive cleaning of the database to remove records with poor coordinates roughly 800,000 occurrence records remained. They then divided the earth into one-degree latitude by longitude grid cells and determined the number of species occurring within each cell. The researchers discovered that the majority of fern species occur in eight principally montane hotspots: Greater Antilles, Mesoamerica, tropical Andes, Guianas, Southeastern Brazil, Madagascar, Malesia and East Asia.""Natural history collections are the primary data for all biodiversity studies, and they are the backbone to this study,"" said Sundue. ""Scientists have been making collections and curating them for hundreds of years. But only recently, the digitization of these records has allowed us to harness their collective power.""Testo agreed, ""There has been a large effort over the last decade to digitize the impressive collection of specimens contributed by thousands of collectors and experts in the field and deposited in museums or natural history collections. For this study we used over 800,000 digitized occurrence records for nearly 8,000 fern species.""The research was conducted in multiple phases and each phase built upon the previous. ""The first thing we wanted to know is where are the centers of ferns' biodiversity, and second, why?"" Suissa said. ""We wanted to understand the biogeographical patterns of fern diversity. Understanding these patterns in a major plant lineage like ferns, allows us to take a step towards understanding why there is an uneven distribution of species around the world.""One major finding is that 58 percent of fern species occur in eight principally montane biodiversity hotspots that comprise only 7 percent of Earth's land area. They also found that within these hotspots, patterns of heightened diversity were amplified at elevations greater than 1000 meters above sea level.""On a global scale we find a peak in species richness per area around 2000 to 3000 meters in elevation, roughly midway up some of these tropical mountains,"" explained Suissa. ""And we think this is primarily due to a very unique ecosystem that occurs in this elevation band, which in the tropics is the cloud forest.""While ferns grow in a variety of ecosystems, including moist shaded forest understories and rocky desert outcrops, many species are actually epiphytic, meaning they grow on the branches of trees. Suissa and colleagues believe these epiphytes explain the mid to upper elevation peak in species richness of ferns in the tropics.Once the researchers determined the biogeographical patterns of fern diversity, they investigated why these particular patterns exist. Examining ecological data, including climate and soil data, they showed that within each hotspot there was a strong correlation between increased climatic space and increased species richness and diversification; suggesting that ferns occurring in tropical mountains are forming new species more rapidly than those elsewhere.""People tend to think of places such as the Amazon rainforest as biodiversity hotspots,"" said Suissa. ""But for ferns, it is tropical and subtropical mountains that harbor a disproportionate number of rapidly diversifying species relative to the land area they occupy. Ferns may be speciating within these tropical mountain systems because of the variation in habitats that occur across elevational gradients. For instance, at the base of a tropical mountain it is hot all year round, and at the summit it is perennially cold. Essentially, these dynamics create many different ecosystems within a small geographic space.""Unlike mountains in temperate regions, the tropics have very low temperature seasonality. This means that each ecosystem across an elevational transect in a tropical mountain remains roughly the same temperature year-round. Effectively, it is harder for plant and animal species to move between elevational zones if they are adapted to one spot on the mountain. Researchers think that these dynamics between the difference in climates at different elevations and the climatic stability within each elevational site allow for plants and animals to diversify more rapidly in tropical mountains.Going forward the researchers hope to conduct more small-scale population-based studies in young tropical mountains to physically test these hypotheses, and to hopefully also add more specimens and continue to expand digitization of museum collections for study.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers have used digitised natural history collections to map the diversity of ferns on Earth, creating a database of over one million specimens with longitude and latitude coordinates.

101,16-Feb-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210216083102.htm,Climate change likely drove the extinction of North America's largest animals,A new study published in,"Before around 10,000 years ago, North America was home to many large and exotic creatures, such as mammoths, gigantic ground-dwelling sloths, larger-than-life beavers, and huge armadillo-like creatures known as glyptodons. But by around 10,000 years ago, most of North America's animals weighing over 44 kg, also known as megafauna, had disappeared. Researchers from the Max Planck Extreme Events Research Group in Jena, Germany, wanted to find out what led to these extinctions. The topic has been intensely debated for decades, with most researchers arguing that human overhunting, climate change, or some combination of the two was responsible. With a new statistical approach, the researchers found strong evidence that climate change was the main driver of extinction.Since the 1960's, it has been hypothesized that, as human populations grew and expanded across the continents, the arrival of specialized ""big-game"" hunters in the Americas some 14,000 year ago rapidly drove many giant mammals to extinction. The large animals did not possess the appropriate anti-predator behaviors to deal with a novel, highly social, tool-wielding predator, which made them particularly easy to hunt. According to proponents of this ""overkill hypothesis,"" humans took full advantage of the easy-to-hunt prey, devastating the animal populations and carelessly driving the giant creatures to extinction.Not everyone agrees with this idea, however. Many scientists have argued that there is too little archaeological evidence to support the idea that megafauna hunting was persistent or widespread enough to cause extinctions. Instead, significant climatic and ecological changes may have been to blame.Around the time of the extinctions (between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago), there were two major climatic changes. The first was a period of abrupt warming that began around 14,700 years ago, and the second was a cold snap around 12,900 years ago during which the Northern Hemisphere returned to near-glacial conditions. One or both of these important temperature swings, and their ecological ramifications, have been implicated in the megafauna extinctions.""A common approach has been to try to determine the timing of megafauna extinctions and to see how they align with human arrival in the Americas or some climatic event,"" says Mathew Stewart, co-lead author of the study. ""However, extinction is a process -- meaning that it unfolds over some span of time -- and so to understand what caused the demise of North America's megafauna, it's crucial that we understand how their populations fluctuated in the lead up to extinction. Without those long-term patterns, all we can see are rough coincidences.""To test these conflicting hypotheses, the authors used a new statistical approach developed by W. Christopher Carleton, the study's other co-lead author, and published last year in the The major problem with the previous approach is that it blends the uncertainty associated with radiocarbon dates with the process scientists are trying to identify.""As a result, you can end up seeing trends in the data that don't really exist, making this method rather unsuitable for capturing changes in past population levels. Using simulation studies where we know what the real patterns in the data are, we have been able to show that the new method does not have the same problems. As a result, our method is able to do a much better job capturing through-time changes in population levels using the radiocarbon record,"" explains Carleton.The authors applied this new approach to the question of the Late Quaternary North American megafauna extinctions. In contrast to previous studies, the new findings show that megafauna populations fluctuated in response to climate change.""Megafauna populations appear to have been increasing as North American began to warm around 14,700 years ago,"" states Stewart. ""But we then see a shift in this trend around 12,900 years ago as North America began to drastically cool, and shortly after this we begin to see the extinctions of megafauna occur.""And while these findings suggest that the return to near glacial conditions around 12,900 years ago was the proximate cause for the extinctions, the story is likely to be more complicated than this.""We must consider the ecological changes associated with these climate changes at both a continental and regional scale if we want to have a proper understanding of what drove these extinctions,"" explains group leader Huw Groucutt, senior author of the study. ""Humans also aren't completely off the hook, as it remains possible that they played a more nuanced role in the megafauna extinctions than simple overkill models suggest.""Many researchers have argued that it is an impossible coincidence that megafauna extinctions around the world often happened around the time of human arrival. However, it is important to scientifically demonstrate that there was a relationship, and even if there was, the causes may have been much more indirect (such as through habitat modification) than a killing frenzy as humans arrived in a region.The authors end their article with a call to arms, urging researchers to develop bigger, more reliable records and robust methods for interpreting them. Only then will we develop a comprehensive understanding of the Late Quaternary megafauna extinction event.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from the Max Planck Extreme Events Research Group in Germany have used a new statistical approach to determine what caused the extinction of North America's megafauna over 10,000 years ago.

Corals provide a safe haven and carbon dioxide while their algal symbionts provide them with food and oxygen produced from photosynthesis. Using the corals Orbicella annularis and Orbicella faveolate in the southern Caribbean, researchers at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) have improved our ability to visualize and track these symbiotic interactions in the face of globally warming sea surface temperatures and deepening seawaters.","""Corals are one of the most resilient organisms on the planet,"" said Mayandi Sivaguru, the co-lead author of the study and Assistant Director of Core Facilities at the IGB. ""They have survived ice ages, greenhouse conditions with no ice, and everything else in between that the planet has thrown at them.""Although they have a long history of weathering disruptions, coral reefs are also sensitive enough to serve as indicators of climate change and oceanic health. As an example, when the sea surface temperature or the seawater acidity increases, corals eject their algal partners -- a phenomenon called coral bleaching -- which converts the corals from green to white. To understand why bleaching occurs, it is important to visualize how the corals interact with their algal partners.Previously, researchers had to peel the skin of corals and place the samples in a blender to study their symbiotic algal partners. The current study uses a non-invasive technique instead. ""We collect small samples of corals on the living reef, bring them back to Illinois, and look at them under the microscope without further processing. Two-photon microscopy allows us to look at their three-dimensional structure, and determine how many algae and what biomolecules are present,"" Sivaguru said. The technique uses light to scan living tissues, allowing the researchers to keep the corals in their original growth structure.The researchers used these new methods to compare the symbionts in two environmental contexts. The first was from shallow to deeper seawater and the second was between seasonal warm-to-cool changes in sea surface temperatures. ""In addition to analyzing the number of symbionts in the coral tissues, which the corals can alter, we also tracked simultaneous changes in mucus and biomolecules produced by the corals, some of which serve as a natural sun block,"" Sivaguru said.The microscopy studies revealed that shallow water corals have lower algal concentrations and produce higher levels of chromatophores, which are biomolecules that protect algae from sunlight damage. On the other hand, the researchers found the opposite pattern in deeper water corals. These corals receive lesser sunlight and would therefore require more algae to keep up with the photosynthetic demand. During seasonal sea surface temperature changes, the warmer water caused decreased mucus production and algal concentrations, but increased photosynthesis and coral skeleton growth. Conversely, cooler waters caused the opposite effect.""We have combined the results of this study to identify universal mechanisms of biomineralization found between water, microbes, living organisms, and rock,"" said Lauren Todorov, the co-lead author, who completed this research as part of her undergraduate B.Sc. thesis at Illinois and is now completing her M.Sc. in Geology. ""This study has allowed us to establish a comprehensive understanding of the coral system as well as make connections to the formation of layered rock in other systems such as hot springs, roman aqueducts, and even human kidney stones.""""This project required several years to complete and required virtually all of the microscopes available in the IGB Core Facilities.

Milbank Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs and the High Meadows Environmental Institute, and director of Princeton's Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment. ""It's why this kind of modeling matters so much. Getting a better grasp on what people will decide to do under specific circumstances will inform adaptation planning in time to save lives. The dangers from climate change can only be addressed effectively with planning long in advance by individuals and governments.""Improving people's access to financial credit is commonly proposed as a policy lever to incentivize migration away from climate hazards, but surprisingly this new model demonstrated that credit access actually increased the number of people who chose to stay along the coast. The researchers attribute this ""mooring"" effect to people having fewer opportunities elsewhere and being able to use credit to protect their households along the coast.Access to credit remains an important mechanism for addressing the vulnerability populations experience in light of climate hazards, argue the researchers. However, broadened access to credit alone is not sufficient to address mobility for climate adaptation purposes. This study provides valuable insights into how the timing and delivery of credit can result in particular behavioral responses. Additional policy interventions -- including regulations on zoning and construction, programs to promote savings behavior, or grants to specific businesses -- should be considered in future studies to see if a combination of approaches yields different migration results, according to the researchers.The model developed by the researchers simulated individual migration decisions at household levels and incorporated numerous variables that would push, pull, or stick people to particular locations, including income opportunities, social network ties, land ownership, credit access, risk tolerance, and flood damage exposure. The study analyzed simulations with 4.8 million migrants across 871 scenarios of projected 21st-century coastal flooding under various greenhouse gas emissions pathways.""With the MIDAS model, we have been much better able to capture the competing factors -- jobs, family, and investment in a place -- that shape an individual's decision to stay or leave, and compare them on an equal footing,"" said Bell.This latest study takes an important step toward more nuanced views of human behavior, illuminating potential climate change adaptation responses that initially seemed counterintuitive. To make further improvements on the model, researchers will need to collect more data on how people are adapting to climate shocks as they occur, and more information about people's interpretation of risks at different levels of exposure. These future models could provide more policy-actionable recommendations that avoid some of the dangers of unintended behavioral responses exposed by this current analysis.",Climate,2021.0,"Contrary to current assumptions, new research co-authored by Princeton University shows that migration to the coast could accelerate in some places despite sea-level change.

As the climate warms, shrubs expand towards higher latitudes and altitudes. Researcher Julia Kemppinen together with her colleagues investigated the impacts of dwarf shrubs on tundra soils in the sub-Arctic Fennoscandia.","The study revealed that the dominance of dwarf shrubs impacts soil microclimate and carbon stocks. Microclimate describes the moisture and temperature conditions close to ground surface. Shrubs are the largest plant life form in the Arctic, and in comparison, to other arctic plants, shrubs use more water and cast more shade.""The results indicate that the dominance of dwarf shrubs decreases soil moisture, soil temperatures and soil organic carbon stocks,"" says Kemppinen.Due to climate change, the dominance of dwarf shrubs has increased in the Fennoscandian tundra, especially the evergreen crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). While in other parts of the Arctic, larger deciduous shrubs have increased. This expansion is called shrubification.The carbon cycle links shrubification back to global climate change. When the dominance of shrubs increases, less carbon is stored in the soils compared to other plant communities. The soil carbon stocks are important, because they store carbon that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere.""Arctic soils store about half of the global belowground organic carbon pool.

Barve found himself wondering how this bird, which weighs about the same as a teaspoon of sugar, was able to flit about the treetops in icy air that was already numbing his fingers. Shoving his hands back into the pockets of his thick down jacket, the question that formed in Barve's mind was ""Do Himalayan birds wear down jackets?""To answer that question, Barve and his co-authors used a microscope to take photos of the chest feathers of 1,715 specimens from the Smithsonian's collections representing 249 species from the cold, high-altitude Himalayan Mountains. Then, Barve and his co-authors used those super-detailed photos to determine exactly how long each feather's downy section was relative to its total length. The team was able to do that by looking at the fluffy downy section of each feather close to its base when compared to the streamlined ends of most birds' feathers.After meticulously logging the relative lengths of all those downy sections, Barve analyzed the results and found that the smallest birds and the birds from the highest elevations, where temperatures are at their coldest, tended to have the highest proportion of down on their body feathers. The analysis showed that high-elevation birds had up to 25% more down in their feathers, and the smallest bird had feathers that were three times as long as the largest birds, proportionately to their body size.Past research suggested that birds from colder habitats sported added downy insulation, but Barve said this is the first study to analyze this pattern for such a large number of species in cold environments and across 15,000 feet of elevation.""Seeing this correlation across so many species makes our findings more general and lets us say these results suggest all passerine birds may show this pattern,"" Barve said. ""And we never would have been able to look at so many different species and get at this more general pattern of evolution without the Smithsonian's collections.""Carla Dove, who runs the museum's Feather Identification Lab and contributed to the study, said she was excited to work together with Barve to use the Smithsonian's collections in a new way. ""Sahas looked at more than 1,700 specimens. Having them all in one place in downtown Washington, D.C., as opposed to having to go to the Himalayas and study these birds in the wild, obviously makes a big difference. It allowed him to gather the data he needed quickly before the COVID lockdowns swept the globe, and then work on the analysis remotely.""Barve said he is following up this study with experiments looking into just how much insulation birds get from their feathers and then will tie that to the feather's structure and proportion of down. One day, Barve aims to develop a model that will allow scientists to look at the structure of a feather and predict how much insulation it gives the bird -- a capability that could help researchers identify species vulnerable to climate change.Dove said the potential to use these results to eventually understand how some birds might cope with climate change highlights the importance of museum collections. ""We have more than 620,000 bird specimens collected over the past 200 years waiting for studies like this. We don't know what our specimens will be used for down the line; that's why we have to maintain them and keep enhancing them. These specimens from the past can be used to predict the future.""Funding and support for this research were provided by the Smithsonian.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study led by Sahas Barve, a Peter Buck Fellow at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, has found that birds living at higher elevations in the Himalayas have more down feathers than birds from lower elevations.

Williams, an environmental scientist and professor in Clark University's Graduate School of Geography, reveals that deforestation in the U.S. does not always cause planetary warming, as is commonly assumed; instead, in some places, it actually cools the planet. A peer-reviewed study by Williams and his team, ""Climate Impacts of U.S. Forest Loss Span Net Warming to Net Cooling,"" published Feb. 12 in ","It is well established that forests soak up carbon dioxide from the air and store it in wood and soils, slowing the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; however, that is not their only effect on climate. Forests also tend to be darker than other surfaces, said Professor Williams, causing them to absorb more sunlight and retain heat, a process known as ""the albedo effect.""""We found that in some parts of the country like the Intermountain West, more forest actually leads to a hotter planet when we consider the full climate impacts from both carbon and albedo effects,"" said Professor Williams. It is important to consider the albedo effect of forests alongside their well-known carbon storage when aiming to cool the planet, he adds.The research was funded by two grants from NASA's Carbon Monitoring System. Williams and his research team -- comprising data scientist Huan Gu, Ph.D. from The Climate Corporation and Tong Jiao, Ph.D. -- found that for approximately one quarter of the country, forest loss causes a persistent net cooling because the albedo effect outweighs the carbon effect. They also discovered that loss of forests east of the Mississippi River and in Pacific Coast states caused planetary warming, while forest loss in the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain West tended to lead to a net cooling.According to Professor Williams, scientists have known for some time that expanding forest cover cannot be assumed to cool the planet or to mitigate global warming. However, this has not always been appreciated broadly.""If we fail to consider both the carbon and the albedo effects, large-scale tree-planting initiatives, such as Canada's 2Billion Trees Initiative and The Nature Conservancy's Plant a Billion Trees campaign, could end up placing trees in locations that are counterproductive for cooling the climate system,"" said Professor Williams.""It is all about putting the right trees in the right place,"" said Williams, ""and studies like ours can help identify where the potential for cooling is greatest.""Every year, approximately one million acres of forest are being converted to non-forest areas across the lower 48 states of the U.S.; this is largely due to suburban and exurban expansion and development. Professor Williams' team found that the net climate impact of a full 15 years of forest losses amounts to about 17% of a single year of U.S. fossil fuel emissions.Williams' research team used state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing to bring a detailed, observational perspective to examine this problem that had previously been assessed mostly with computer models. The three researchers pinpointed the locations of forest loss and identified what those sites became -- urban, agricultural, grassland, shrubland, pasture, or something else. They then quantified how much forest biomass carbon was released to the atmosphere, and how much additional sunlight was reflected out to space. By comparing these two effects they measured the net impact of deforestation on the climate system.The new datasets and methods used in Professor Williams' study show that the tools are available to take the albedo effect into account. The Clark team hopes to generate actionable datasets to share with land managers and policymakers worldwide within the next one or two years, to help ensure that their tree-planting efforts focus on the right places and have the intended effects.",Climate,2021.0,"Forests are known to absorb carbon dioxide and store it in wood and soils, slowing the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

In a new study spanning nearly 13 years, she and her colleagues discovered that the ground squirrel has joined many other small mammals in Colorado's Rocky Mountains that are making an ominous trek: They're climbing uphill to avoid warming temperatures in the state brought on by climate change.""It's frightening,"" said McCain, an associate professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. ""We've been talking about climate change in the Rockies for a long time, but I think we can say that this is a sign that things are now responding and responding quite drastically.""The golden-mantled ground squirrel, which is often confused for a chipmunk, lives in conifer forests in the Rockies and several other western mountain ranges.""It is likely one of the most photographed mammals in Rocky Mountain National Park as it poses and preens on rocks near the roadside and in campgrounds,"" said McCain, also curator of vertebrates at the CU Museum of Natural History. ""They hibernate in winter, are territorial in the summer, and they make distinctive alarm calls to notify each other of nearby dangers.""Her latest research, published this week in the journal The team reports that, on average, the ranges of these critters seem to have shifted by more than 400 feet up in elevation since the 1980s. Montane mammals, or those already living at higher elevations like the ground squirrel, have taken the biggest brunt -- moving up by 1,100 feet on average. It's a significant change that, if it continues, could wind up squeezing many of these animals out of Colorado entirely.And while many of these small creatures won't ever show up on Colorado postcards, McCain said that they may be bellwethers for larger and increasingly urgent changes in the Rocky Mountains.For McCain, the project is, in many ways, a culmination of her lifelong love of mountains.It began in the mid-1990s when she was serving in the Peace Corps in Honduras. There, McCain was taken by how much the tropical nation's mountains resembled layer cakes: As she climbed up in elevation, mountain ecosystems transformed around her, sometimes dramatically.""Every place you went to, there were completely different birds,"" she said. ""The changes are so stark.""But that layer cake nature may also be the downfall of mountain ecosystems in the face of climate change. Colorado has warmed by nearly 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1980s because of human-caused climate change. As the state heats up, many scientists have predicted that ponderosa pine forests and other mountain ecosystems will have to move higher to find cooler weather. Some animals, and even entire communities, may be pushed to the tops of mountains with nowhere else to go.McCain and her colleagues wanted to find out if that upward shift was already happening in the Rockies.Beginning in 2008, her team visited multiple sites in Colorado's Front Range and San Juan mountains to collect records of the current ranges of 47 species of rodents and shrews. They included rare animals, such as the pygmy shrew (Sorex hoyi), which weighs less than a quarter and ranks as North America's smallest mammal. The endangered Preble's jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei), known for its long tail and big feet that are useful for swimming, also made the list. In some cases, McCain said, the habitats were so remote that the researchers traveled using horse trains to carry their equipment.""We had to get used to really unpleasant conditions,"" McCain said. ""We put up with being wet in the mountains and being hot in the desert, flash floods and lightning storms.""The group then compared the findings from their surveys to roughly 4,500 historic records from museum collections in the Front Range and San Juan mountains dating back to the 1880s. They included animals stored in CU Boulder's own museum, which houses nearly 12,000 mammal specimens from Colorado.The results showed a complex response to climate change and other pressures. Some of the animals in the survey, McCain said, moved down in elevation, not up, while others actually saw their ranges increase since the 1980s.But most of the study mammals shifted uphill -- and not by a small amount. That was especially true for those already living at high elevations. Before 1980, the pygmy shrew, for example, was never detected above 9,800 feet in elevation. Today, its maximum extent is more than 11,800 feet. The golden-mantled ground squirrel similarly hiked up by 650 feet, or 200 meters, in the Front Range and 2,300 feet, or 700 meters, in the San Juans.""I was expecting that we would see something between 100 to 200 meters, but we saw a lot more,"" McCain said. ""This is way bigger than the change that has been determined in other mountain regions around the world.""The study, McCain said, paints a stark picture of a mountain range in crisis. But it's one with a silver lining: There may still be time to protect the West's iconic ponderosa pine forests, alpine meadows and scraggly tundra -- but only if Coloradans and people around the world act now to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.""It's a wake-up call,"" McCain said. ""We have to start taking this seriously immediately if we want to have healthy mountains and ecosystems.""Other coauthors on the new study include Tim Szewczyk, a former graduate student at CU Boulder now at the University of Lausanne, and Sarah King of Colorado State University.",Climate,2021.0,"Small mammals in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, including the golden-mantled ground squirrel, are moving uphill to avoid warming temperatures caused by climate change, according to a study by ecologists at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Combining pollen records to plant traits provides a picture of how well ecosystems have functioned under different scenarios, Brussel said.""The biggest finding in this study is that researchers can now be confident that transforming pollen into the processes that ecosystems undergo works,"" he said. ""With this information, we can now explore new questions that were previously unanswerable and provide positive guidance on how we can conserve and manage landscapes and biodiversity.""Brussel began pursuing the approach as a doctoral student at the University of Utah in the emerging field of functional paleoecology. Initial reception to the approach, when presented at conferences, drew interest but also calls for proof that the idea is possible, Brussel said. The paper, co-authored with his Utah mentor Simon Christopher Brewer, provides a proof-of-concept that his approach works.For the study, Brussel and Brewer merged publicly available records for surface pollen samples found in the Neotoma Paleoecology Database and plant traits, specifically leaf area, plant height and seed mass, from the Botanical Information and Ecology Network.They then restricted their results to only plants native to ecosystems from Mexico to Canada by combing through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's PLANTS Database and a compilation of all native plants in Mexico.The resulting data for North America covers some 1,300 individual sites and includes 9.5 million plant height measurements for 2,146 species, 13,103 leaf area details from 1,016 species, and 16,621 seed mass data from 3,580 species.The information, Brussel said, provides extensive details on the fitness of ecosystems that should help researchers study the mechanisms of changes in carbon or water cycling related to climate change.""Our work is extremely relevant to modern climate change,"" he said. ""The past houses all these natural experiments. The data are there. We can use that data as parallels for what may happen in the future. Using trait-based information through this approach, we can gain new insight, with confidence, that we haven't been able to get at before now.""At the UO, Brussel is working with Melissa Lucash, a research assistant professor who studies large, forested landscapes with a focus on the impacts of climate change and wildfires. Brussel is part of Lucash's research on potential climate changes being faced by Siberia's boreal forests and tundra.He also is applying his approach to potential conservation and management strategies for some of the world's biodiversity hotspots, which are seeing a decline in plant species and wildlife as a result of global change.""Using the newly validated approach, my idea is to assess the severity of the biodiversity degradation that has been occurring in these regions over recent millennia,"" Brussel said. ""My end goal is to create a list of regions that can be prioritized for hotspot conservation, based on how severe an ecosystem's services have declined over time.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new approach using pollen records and plant traits could help understand how plants provide benefits to humans over the past 21,000 years.

The rates were then compared to those of control areas with similar characteristics such as elevation, slope and proximity to densely populated areas.They found protected areas' deforestation rate is 41% lower than that of unprotected areas. They also found that earlier estimates suggesting 15.7% of the Earth's forest were protected from deforestation were much too optimistic.""It's clearly not enough just to call a forest area 'protected' and assume that it really is,"" Wolf said. ""When you look at conservation effectiveness, you can't simply rely on the amount of officially protected land as a metric. Nearly one-third of all protected areas are actually under intense human pressure.""Protected area deforestation rates were highest in Africa, Europe and South America and lowest in Oceania -- Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and nearby island chains.Among the 63 nations studied, 34 have at least 17% of their forest area protected -- i.e., are in line with the target percentage established by the Convention on Biological Diversity.New Zealand ranked No. 1 in percentage of area protected when effectiveness was factored in, and China ranked last. South Africa's protected areas were the most effective, with deforestation rates eight times lower than those of control sites. Sierra Leone, Malaysia and Cambodia were the three nations losing their forest cover the fastest.""Protected area effectiveness is limited by varying levels of monitoring and enforcement and the money available for them,"" Wolf said.

In some areas, the flooding season will expand, as well.""The flood you're used to seeing out your window once every 10 years will likely be larger than it has been in the past,"" said the study's lead author, Laura Queen, a research assistant at OSU's Oregon Climate Change Research Institute.The findings are based on natural river conditions and do not take into account potential flood control measures, including dams, but the increases are significant nonetheless, said study co-author Philip Mote, a professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and dean of the Graduate School at OSU.""We don't know how much of this increased flood risk can be managed through mitigation measures until we study the issue further,"" Mote said. ""But managing a 30% to 40% increase, as is predicted for many areas, is clearly beyond our management capabilities.""The findings were published recently in the journal The study emerged out of Queen's work on her honors thesis as an undergraduate in the University of Oregon's Robert D. Clark Honors College. Queen, a Corvallis native, continued the work at OCCRI and is now enrolled in a doctoral program at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.The goal of Queen's research was to better understand how flooding in the Columbia River basin might change as the planet warms. The Columbia River drains much of the Pacific Northwest, including portions of seven states and British Columbia. It has the fourth-largest streamflow volume in the United States.The Pacific Northwest has a history of costly and disruptive flooding. The largest flood in modern history occurred in late spring 1948 when flooding from the Columbia River destroyed the city of Vanport, Oregon, displacing more than 18,500 people. Floods on the Chehalis River in 2007 and 2009 closed Interstate 5 in Washington and floods along the Willamette River in 1996 and 2019 caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.Queen ran simulations using hydrology models and a previously collected set of streamflow data for 396 sites throughout the Columbia River basin and other watersheds in western Washington. The data included a 50-year window from the past, 1950-1999, as well as a 50-year window of expected streamflows in the future, 2050 to 2099, that was developed using several different climate models.Previous studies predicting future streamflows showed mixed results, but the results of this new analysis were clear and surprising, Mote said.""This was the best and most complete set of data,"" he said. ""It shows that the magnitude of one-, 10- and 100-year floods is likely go up nearly everywhere in the region. These are profound shifts.""The Willamette River and its tributaries are expected to see the biggest increase in flooding magnitude, with 50% to 60% increases in 100-year floods. The streamflows are expected to be smaller downstream and grow larger upstream.On the Snake River, streamflows will grow larger as they move downstream until they reach the confluence of the Salmon River tributary and then will drop abruptly. Parts of the Snake River will see a 40% increase in 10-year floods and a 60% increase in 100-year floods. But below the confluence with the Salmon River on the Oregon-Idaho border, the increase drops to 20% for 10-year floods and 30% for 100-year floods.The model also suggests a significant increase in the flood season on the Snake River, which is largely concentrated in late spring now but could start as early as December or January in the future, Mote said.One of the drivers of the change is warmer winters that will see precipitation fall more as rain instead of snow. Lower spring snowpack will lead to earlier spring streamflows in many rivers. The cold upper Columbia River basin in Canada is projected to experience little change in snowpack volume, but the snow will melt faster.The study's findings could have implications for flood management policy in the coming decades, Mote said. A logical next step in the research is to run the models again and include existing dams to see the role they may play in mitigating flooding.""This work provides information and impetus for the people who manage flood risk,"" he said. ""We'll need to know how much of this can be mitigated by existing flood control.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new study warns that flooding in the Pacific Northwest, including the Columbia, Willamette and Snake rivers and hundreds of tributaries, is expected to become more severe due to climate change.

This dramatic break off was preceded by quite a rapid melt of 2.5 kilometres of ice a year. This parallels the current melt rates in Antarctica and Greenland and worries the scientists behind the study.","""Our measurements of the ice retreat in Storfjorden Trough show that the prevailing conditions to the great break off, match what we see in Antarctica and Greenland today. It is uncanny. There are new studies published almost weekly, that show that the retreat of current ice sheets is two to four km a year and that it's speeding up."" Says CAGE-professor and first author Tine Lander Rasmussen.The last deglaciation, 20,000 to 10,000 years ago, was a period of coexisting global warming and rapidly shrinking ice sheets. But stating the actual correlation between the two is not as simple as it sounds. The period in question was climatically unstable, and big melts were interrupted by re-freezing and formation of new ice. The speed of the ice retreat, relative to climatic changes, has therefore been difficult to establish.""We have studied the ice sheet development 20,000 - 10,000 years ago using marine sediment cores. The 12 cores have been collected in the area during the past 18 years, and meticulously analysed for different types of microfossils of single-celled organisms called foraminifera,"" says Rasmussen.The biochemistry in the foraminifera fossils helps reconstruct the enormous amount of information about the state of the environment in prehistoric times. The sediments were sliced up in slices representing time periods of 30 to 70 years. Over 70 samples were dated and analyzed.""What we saw is that the ice sheet starts retreating some 20,000 years ago but lingers on a ridge in the fjord. Then, some 15,000 years ago the atmosphere and ocean temperatures warm up, impacting the ocean circulation. A huge chunk of the ice sheet disappears at the same time. At the start of the Holocene warm period, 11,000 years ago, things really pick up speed. We can't see any more evidence of an ice sheet covering the ocean floor after that time.""The periods of extremely rapid ice sheet retreats are consistently correlating with periods of global warming of oceans and temperature. This is mirrored in ice sheet retreat from other eight Northern Norwegian fjord systems.""This is strengthening our hypothesis that an increase in ocean temperature and global warming is the direct cause of the chain of the events leading up to the dramatically rapid ice sheet disintegration."" Says Rasmussen.This gives some alarming perspectives on present-day outlook. The great melt of the glacial maximum to the Holocene was 10,000 years in the making. The present climate change is much more rapid.""The final retreat of the Storfjorden Trough ice sheet happened as rapidly in the outer parts as it did further up the trough. This means that as soon as warmer oceanic water got access to the ice sheet, it surged pretty rapidly inward from the edge of the ice shelf. To the interior of the sheet itself.

While it's not a monster, it has largely remained a mystery.","According to 25 international researchers who collaborated on a first-of-its-kind study, frozen land beneath rising sea levels currently traps 60 billion tons of methane and 560 billion tons of organic carbon. Little is known about the frozen sediment and soil -- called submarine permafrost -- even as it slowly thaws and releases methane and carbon that could have significant impacts on climate.To put into perspective the amount of greenhouse gases in submarine permafrost, humans have released about 500 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, said Sandia National Laboratories geosciences engineer Jennifer Frederick, one of the authors on the study published in IOP Publishing journal While researchers predict that submarine permafrost is not a ticking time bomb and could take hundreds of years to emit its greenhouse gases, Frederick said submarine permafrost carbon stock represents a potential giant ecosystem feedback to climate change not yet included in climate projections and agreements.""It's expected to be released over a long period of time, but it's still a significant amount,"" she said. ""This expert assessment is bringing to light that we can't just ignore it because it's underwater, and we can't see it. It's lurking there, and it's a potentially large source of carbon, particularly methane.""The team of researchers led by Brigham Young University graduate student Sara Sayedi and senior researcher Ben Abbott compiled available articles and reports on the subject to create a base analysis of submarine permafrost's potential to affect climate change. The study was coordinated through the Permafrost Carbon Network, which has more than 400 members from 130 research institutions in 21 countries.The study was conducted through an expert assessment that sought answers to several central questions: What is the current extent of submarine permafrost? How much carbon is locked in submarine permafrost? How much has been and will be released? What is the rate of release into the atmosphere?The participating experts answered questions using their scientific skills, which could include modeling, data analysis or literature synthesis. Frederick, one of the original advocates of the study, has been modeling submarine permafrost for almost 10 years and answered the questions through the lens of her research, which is primarily in numerical modeling. She said she uses published material for model inputs or works directly with researchers who visit the Arctic and provide datasets.Her work on the study was funded by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program that enables Sandia scientists and engineers to explore innovative solutions to national security issues.Frederick's work aligned with Sandia's Arctic Science and Security Initiative. For more than 20 years, the Labs have had a presence in northern Alaska, said Sandia atmospheric sciences manager Lori Parrott.Working for the Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Sandia manages the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility that collects atmospheric data continuously. Researchers measure and predict the speed of de-icing at the North Slope to help federal leaders make decisions on climate change and national security. In addition, Sandia creates accurate models for both sea and land ice and develops technologies for greenhouse gas monitoring. With more than 20 years of data, researchers can begin to decipher trends, Parrott said.""I hope this study begins to unite the research community in submarine permafrost,"" said Frederick. ""Historically, it's not only been a challenging location to do field work and make observations, but language barriers and other obstacles in accessibility to the existing observations and literature has challenged international scientific progress in this area.""The team estimates that submarine permafrost has been thawing since the end of the last glacial period 14,000 years ago, and currently releases about 140 million tons of carbon dioxide and 5.3 million tons of methane into the atmosphere each year. This represents a small fraction of total human-caused greenhouse gas emissions per year, about the same yearly footprint as Spain, Sayedi said.However, modern greenhouse gas releases are predominantly a result of the natural response to deglaciation, according to the study. Expert estimates from this study suggest human-caused global warming may accelerate greenhouse gas release, but due to lack of research and uncertainties in this area, determining causes and rates of the release will remain unknown until better empirical and modeling estimates are available.""I'm optimistic that this study will shed light on the fact that submarine permafrost exists, and that people are studying its role in climate,"" Frederick said. ""The size of the research community doesn't necessarily reflect its importance in the climate system.""Almost every expert involved in the study mentioned the permafrost knowledge gap, which makes it harder for scientists to anticipate changes and reduces the reliability of estimates of carbon pools and fluxes, as well as the thermal and hydrological conditions of permafrost. Frederick said that while there is a wealth of ongoing research on terrestrial permafrost, submarine permafrost hasn't been taken on like this before, and hasn't been the subject of nearly as much international collaboration.The amount of carbon sequestered or associated with submarine permafrost is relevant when compared to the numbers of carbon in terrestrial permafrost and what's in the atmosphere today, Frederick said.""This is an example of a very large source of carbon that hasn't been considered in climate predictions or agreements,"" she said.

The research, which involved interviews with 227 farmers, found that knowledge of birds and nature connection were not correlated, and they did not have any predictors in common.Many farmers recognised bird species that have adapted to farmland and are widespread in Brazil, but most struggled to identify birds that only live in the Amazon forest.The study is the first of its kind to be carried out in the ""Global South"" and is significant because previous, similar studies in the US and Europe indicated that knowledge of biodiversity enhances connection with nature.The Amazon rainforest is under threat from deforestation and climate change, and its farm-forest frontiers are suffering from intense habitat and biodiversity loss. Therefore, understanding the feelings and motivations of its farmers is vital as studies have shown that farmers who care strongly about nature are more likely to engage in conservation.Dr Katarzyna Mikolajczak, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and lead author of the study, said: ""Farmers' decisions are critical for the survival of the Amazon and the species that live there, but their environmental motivations are rarely studied. We investigated how a form of the farmers' ecological knowledge -- the ability to recognise local bird species -- related to their sense of attachment and caring about nature, known as nature connection.""We found that farmers do not need intimate knowledge of local biodiversity to care about nature. However, at the same time, farmers might have difficulty protecting species without some knowledge -- many of the farmers struggled to identify birds commonly found in the Amazon, so may fail to realise the value of forests as an irreplaceable habitat for many species.""Our results contrast with previous similar studies that have taken place in industrialised nations in the Global North, namely the UK and the US, that found a positive correlation between knowing and caring about nature.""This suggests that the relationship between ecological knowledge and nature connection is complex and might be context-specific, and we shouldn't assume there is a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to encouraging nature conservation.

Baker and her co-authors are all affiliated with the HMEI Climate Change and Infectious Disease initiative.""Although we have witnessed a substantial number of COVID-19 cases, population-level immunity remains low in many locations,"" Baker said. ""This means that if you roll back enforcement or adherence to control measures, you can still expect a large outbreak. Climate factors including winter weather play a secondary role and certainly don't help.""The researchers found that even maintaining rigid control measures through the summer can lead to a wintertime outbreak if climate factors provided enough of a boost to viral transmission. ""If summertime controls are holding the transmissibility of coronavirus at a level that only just mitigates an outbreak, then winter climate conditions can push you over the edge,"" Baker said. ""Nonetheless, having effective control measures in place last summer could have limited the winter outbreaks we're now experiencing.""Cases have climbed in many northern hemisphere locations since November. In the United States, spikes in COVID-19 cases are thought to be tied to increased travel and gatherings for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Notably, outbreaks were recorded in temperate locations such as Los Angeles in addition to regions with much colder conditions, Baker said. At the same time, large outbreaks were observed in South Africa from November to January, which are that country's summer months.""The greater incidence of COVID-19 in various environs really speaks to the climate's limited role at this stage,"" Baker said.In May, the same authors published a paper in the journal Science suggesting that local climate variations would be unlikely to affect the coronavirus pandemic. The paper suggested that hopes that the warmer conditions of summer would slow the transmission of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in the northern hemisphere were unrealistic.Gabriel Vecchi, a professor of geosciences and the High Meadows Environmental Institute and co-author of both studies, said that the virus currently spreads too quickly and that people are too susceptible for climate to be a determining factor.""The influence of climate and weather on infection rates should become more evident -- and thus a potentially useful source of information for disease prediction -- as growing immunity moves the disease into endemic phases from the present epidemic stage,"" Vecchi said.The most recent study provides insight on how scientists can determine the impact of various factors on the virus at various times, said co-author C.

Value estimations for grid-tied photovoltaic systems prove solar panels are beneficial for utility companies and consumers alike.","For years some utility companies have worried that solar panels drive up electric costs for people without panels. Joshua Pearce, Richard Witte Endowed Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Michigan Technological University, has shown the opposite is true -- grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) owners are actually subsidizing their non-PV neighbors.Most PV systems are grid-tied and convert sunlight directly into electricity that is either used on-site or fed back into the grid. At night or on cloudy days, PV-owning customers use grid-sourced electricity so no batteries are needed.""Anyone who puts up solar is being a great citizen for their neighbors and for their local utility,"" Pearce said, noting that when someone puts up grid-tied solar panels, they are essentially investing in the grid itself. ""Customers with solar distributed generation are making it so utility companies don't have to make as many infrastructure investments, while at the same time solar shaves down peak demands when electricity is the most expensive.""Pearce and Koami Soulemane Hayibo, graduate student in the Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology (MOST) Lab, found that grid-tied PV-owning utility customers are undercompensated in most of the U.S., as the ""value of solar"" eclipses both the net metering and two-tiered rates that utilities pay for solar electricity. Their results are published online now and will be printed in the March issue of The value of solar is becoming the preferred method for evaluating the economics of grid-tied PV systems. Yet value of solar calculations are challenging and there is widespread disagreement in the literature on the methods and data needed. To overcome these limitations, Pearce and Hayibo's paper reviews past studies to develop a generalized model that considers realistic costs and liabilities utility companies can avoid when individual people install grid-tied solar panels. Each component of the value has a sensitivity analysis run on the core variables and these sensitivities are applied for the total value of solar.The overall value of solar equation has numerous components:Pearce said one of the paper's goals was to provide the equations to determine the value of solar so individual utility companies can plug in their proprietary data to quickly make a complete valuation.""It can be concluded that substantial future regulatory reform is needed to ensure that grid-tied solar PV owners are not unjustly subsidizing U.S. electric utilities,"" Pearce explains. ""This study provides greater clarity to decision makers so they see solar PV is truly an economic benefit in the best interest of all utility customers.""Solar PV technology is now a profitable method to decarbonize the grid, but if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided, emissions from transportation and heating must also decarbonize, Pearce argues.One approach to renewable heating is leveraging improvements in PV with heat pumps (HPs), and it turns out investing in PV+HP tech has a better rate of return than CDs or savings accounts.To determine the potential for PV+HP systems in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Pearce performed numerical simulations and economic analysis using the same loads and climate, but with local electricity and natural gas rates for Sault Ste. Marie, in both Canada and U.S. North American residents can profitably install residential PV+HP systems, earning up to 1.9% return in the U.S. and 2.7% in Canada, to provide for all of their electric and heating needs.""Our results suggest northern homeowners have a clear and simple method to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by making an investment that offers a higher internal rate of return than savings accounts, CDs and global investment certificates in both the U.S. and Canada,"" Pearce said.

An important question is the degree of mobilization and atmospheric release of vast soil carbon stocks, partly stored in permafrost, with amplified warming of these regions. A fraction of this carbon is exported to inland waters and emitted to the atmosphere, yet these losses are poorly constrained and seldom accounted for in assessments of high latitude carbon balances. This is particularly relevant for Western Siberia, with its extensive peatland carbon stocks that are expected to be affected by climate warming.Now researchers at the Climate Impacts Research Centre (CIRC), Umeå University, and collaborators from Russia and France have quantified the carbon emission from inland waters of Western Siberia.

The carbon emission from the inland waters was almost an order of magnitude higher that carbon export to the Arctic Ocean and reached nearly half of the region's land carbon uptake.""The high significance of inland waters in the carbon cycle of Western Siberia is likely a result of the overall flat terrain, which lead to relatively high water coverage and long water transit times, and thus favorable conditions for decomposition and outgassing of land derived carbon in inland waters.

Insects and plants, for example, are two large groups on earth that are linked by a variety of interactions. Since the mid-20th century, theories linking this diversity and specific interactions have proliferated.","The development of new technologies and new methods has made it possible to study the interaction between plants and insects in greater detail and to reveal the impact of these interactions on their respective evolution. In a new study, an international team of researchers, including botanist Prof. Stefan Wanke of TU Dresden, has established the link between ecological changes, genome-level adaptations and macroevolutionary consequences, confirming the importance of ecological interactions as drivers of evolution over long periods of time.Butterflies belonging to the family Papilionidae are an exemplary group for this question. These butterflies specialize in the consumption of poisonous plants, with about 30% of the species feeding exclusively on plants in the family Aristolochiaceae.Consumption of such plants gives the caterpillars of these butterflies an advantage, as they secrete the plants' toxins, which in turn make them poisonous. However, the larvae themselves do not suffer any harm from the toxin.""We knew before we started this study that certain genes of the cytochrome P450 family in the Papillonidae are partly responsible for the adaptation to plants, especially for the detoxification of toxic compounds. However, many different genes are probably involved overall, because in addition to detoxification, this adaptation requires that the female butterfly is able to recognize its preferred plant, or also that the caterpillars can develop and survive normally in this environment"" explains Prof. Wanke. Scientists had long suspected that evolutionary changes in plants must have an influence on many insect genes. From this, the international team first deduced the relationships between different Papilionidae species and reconstructed their host-plant preferences over time. This allowed them to show that Papilionidae feed on plants belonging to the family Aristolochiaceae and, in particular, the pipevine genus Aristolochia.Based on the global distribution of these two groups of insects and plants, it was then possible to estimate the historical biogeography -- the movement in time and space -- of Papilionidae and Aristolochiaceae species. The researchers discovered that both groups originated in the Northern Hemisphere about 55 million years ago and subsequently spread throughout the world.In the case of the Papilionidae, this migration has been accompanied by major changes in host plants since their emergence. The study of Papilionidae species confirmed that various host-plant shifts were generally associated with accelerated species diversification of the butterflies. In other words, more species emerged as a result of host plant change than when the host plant was retained.""Despite our knowledge of the role of key genes such as detoxification genes in the resistance against plant defense mechanisms, our results suggest a more global effect of host plant change on the evolution of Papilionidae.

This is farther north than young white sharks have ever been seen before as the animals historically remain in warmer waters in the southern California Current.Water temperature in the Aptos area averages about 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius), but temperature extremes have become more common since the heatwave hit, rising as high as 69 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) in August 2020.Scientists conducted the research by collecting data from tags the Aquarium and its partners deployed on juvenile white sharks beginning in 2002 to see where the animals were spending most of their time.The team analyzed 22 million electronic data records from 14 sharks and then compared these data to 38 years of ocean temperatures to map the cold edge of the animals' thermal preferences, or ""niche.""The study charts the significant northward shift in the young white sharks' range.Between 1982 and 2013, the northernmost edge of the juveniles' range was located near Santa Barbara (34° N). But after the marine heatwave, their range shifted dramatically north to Bodega Bay (38.5° N). Ever since, the young sharks' range limit has hovered near Monterey (36° N).""After studying juvenile white shark behavior and movements in southern California for the last 16 years, it is very interesting to see this northerly shift in nursery habitat use,"" said Dr. Chris Lowe, a co-author of the study and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach. ""I think this is what many biologists have expected to see as the result of climate change and rising ocean temperatures. Frankly, I'll be surprised if we don't see this northerly shift across more species.""Because this shift took scientists by surprise, the team turned to novel sources of data such as community science and recreational fishing records to document this northward movement of the population.""This study would not have been possible without contributions from our community scientists and treasured Aquarium volunteers,"" says Dr. Van Houtan. ""Eric Mailander, a local firefighter, provided a decade of detailed logbook records of shark sightings, and volunteer Carol Galginaitis transcribed those hand-written data into an electronic database.""The researchers say this study reinforces what scientists have been saying for years: animals and the living world are revealing the impacts of climate change.""White sharks, otters, kelp, lobsters, corals, redwoods, monarch butterflies -- these are all showing us that climate change is happening right here in our backyard,"" says Dr. Van Houtan. ""It's time for us to take notice and listen to this chorus from nature. We know that greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly disrupting our climate and this is taking hold in many ways. Our study showed one example of juvenile white sharks appearing in Monterey Bay. But let's be clear: The sharks are not the problem. Our emissions are the problem. We need to act on climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.""",Climate,2021.0,"Juvenile white sharks are moving north in search of suitable thermal habitats due to rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change, according to a study by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and partners.

The analysis found that on current trends, the planet had only a 5% chance of staying below 2 degrees Celsius warming this century -- the international climate treaty's supposed goal.","Now, the same authors have used their tools to ask: What emissions cuts would actually be required to meet the goal of 2 C warming, considered a threshold for climate stability and climate-related risks such as excessive heat, drought, extreme weather and sea level rise?The University of Washington study finds that emissions reductions about 80% more ambitious than those in the Paris Agreement, or an average of 1.8% drop in emissions per year rather than 1% per year, would be enough to stay within 2 degrees. The results were published Feb. 9 in Nature's open-access journal ""A number of people have been saying, particularly in the past few years, that the emissions targets need to be more ambitious,"" said lead author Adrian Raftery, a UW professor of statistics. ""We went beyond that to ask in a more precise way: How much more ambitious do they need to be?""The paper uses the same statistical approach to model the three main drivers of human-produced greenhouse gases: national population, gross domestic product per person and the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity, known as carbon intensity. It then uses a statistical model to show the range of likely future outcomes based on data and projections so far.Even with updated methods and five more years of data, now spanning 1960 through 2015, the conclusion remains similar to the previous study: Meeting Paris Agreement targets would give only a 5% probability of staying below 2 degrees Celsius warming.Assuming that climate policies won't target population growth or economic growth, the authors then ask what change in the ""carbon intensity"" measure would be needed to meet the 2 degrees warming goal.Increasing the overall targets to cut carbon emissions by an average of 1.8% annually, and continuing on that path after the Paris Agreement expires in 2030, would give the planet a 50% chance of staying below 2 degrees warming by 2100.""Achieving the Paris Agreement's temperature goals is something we're not on target to do now, but it wouldn't take that much extra to do it,"" said first author Peiran Liu, who did the research as part of his doctorate at the UW.The paper looks at what this overall plan would mean for different countries' Paris Agreement commitments. Nations set their own Paris Agreement emissions-reductions pledges. The United States pledged a 1% drop in carbon emissions per year until 2026, or slightly more ambitious than the average. China pledged to reduce its carbon intensity, or the carbon emissions per unit of economic activity, by 60% of its 2005 levels by 2030.""Globally, the temperature goal requires an 80% boost in the annual rate of emissions decline compared to the Paris Agreement, but if a country has finished most of its promised mitigation measures, then the extra decline required now will be smaller,"" Liu said.Assuming that each country's share of the work remains unchanged, the U.S. would need to increase its goal by 38% to do its part toward actually achieving the 2 degrees goal. China's more ambitious and fairly successful plan would need only a 7% boost, and the United Kingdom, which has made substantial progress already, would need a 17% increase. On the other hand, countries that had pledged cuts but where emissions have risen, like South Korea and Brazil, would need a bigger boost now to make up for the lost time.The authors also suggest that countries increase their accountability by reviewing progress annually, rather than on the five-year, 10-year or longer timescales included in many existing climate plans.""To some extent, the discourse around climate has been: 'We have to completely change our lifestyles and everything,'"" Raftery said. ""The idea from our work is that actually, what's required is not easy, but it's quantifiable. Reducing global emissions by 1.8% per year is a goal that's not astronomical.""From 2011 to 2015, Raftery says, the U.S. did see a drop in emissions, due to efficiencies in industries ranging from lighting to transportation as well as regulation. The pandemic-related economic changes will be short-lived, he predicts, but the creativity and flexibility the pandemic has required may usher in a lasting drop in emissions.""If you say, 'Everything's a disaster and we need to radically overhaul society,' there's a feeling of hopelessness,"" Raftery said. ""But if we say, 'We need to reduce emissions by 1.8% a year,' that's a different mindset.""This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study by the University of Washington has found that to stay within the 2°C warming threshold for climate stability and climate-related risks such as drought, extreme weather, and sea level rise, emissions reductions about 80% more ambitious than those in the Paris Agreement would be required.

In most of the ocean, however, enough manganese is available to phytoplankton that it does not limit its growth.Measurements in remote regions of the Southern Ocean, on the other hand, have shown much lower manganese concentrations. During an expedition on the British research vessel RRS JAMES CLARK ROSS through the Drake Passage between Tierra del Fuego and the Antarctic Peninsula in November 2018, Dr. Browning and his team took water samples. While still on board, they used these water samples and the phytoplankton they contained to conduct experiments on which nutrients affect growth and which do not.""In doing so, we were able to demonstrate for the first time a manganese limitation for phytoplankton growth in the center of Drake Passage. Closer to shore, iron was the limiting factor, as expected,"" Dr. Browning reports.After the expedition, the team used additional model calculations to assess the implications of the experimental results. Among other things, they found that manganese limitation may have been even more widespread during the ice ages than it is today. ""This would make this previously unaccounted for factor a central part of understanding the ice ages,"" says Dr. Browning.However, because this is the first record in a specific region of the Southern Ocean, further research is needed to better understand the geographic extent and timing of manganese limitation in the Southern Ocean.

""We think of forests as providing ecosystem services. Those services can be a lot of different things -- recreation, timber, industry. We demonstrate how forests perform another important service: acting as sinks for carbon dioxide. Our research shows that forests consume large amounts of carbon dioxide globally. Without that, more carbon dioxide would go into the air and build up in the atmosphere even more than it already is, which could exacerbate climate change. Our work shows yet another important reason to preserve and maintain our forests and keep them healthy.""Previously, scientists have thought that trees were using water more efficiently over the past century through reduced stomatal conductance -- meaning trees were retaining more moisture when the pores on their leaves began closing slightly under rising levels of carbon dioxide.However, following an analysis using carbon and oxygen isotopes in tree rings from 1901 to 2015 from 36 tree species at 84 sites around the world, the researchers found that in 83% of cases, the main driver of trees' increased water efficiency was increased photosynthesis -- they processed more carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, the stomatal conductance only drove increased efficiency 17% of the time. This reflects a major change in how trees' water efficiency has been explained in contrast to previous research.""We've shown that over the past century, photosynthesis is actually the overwhelming driver to increases in tree water use efficiency, which is a surprising result because it contradicts many earlier studies,"" Mathias said. ""On a global scale, this will have large implications potentially for the carbon cycle if more carbon is being transferred from the atmosphere into trees.""Since 1901, the intrinsic water use efficiency of trees worldwide has risen by approximately 40% in conjunction with an increase of approximately 34% in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Both of these characteristics increased approximately four times faster since the 1960s compared to the previous years.While these results show the rise in carbon dioxide is the main factor in making trees use water more efficiently, the results also vary depending on temperature, precipitation and dryness of the atmosphere. These data can help refine models used to predict the effects of climate change on global carbon and water cycles.""Having an accurate representation of these processes is critical in making sound predictions about what may happen in the future,"" Mathias said.

Through these seemingly small variations climate change may have strong effects on economic growth. This shows data analyzed by researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Columbia University and the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC). In a new study in ","""We have known for a while that changes in annual mean temperature impacts macroeconomic growth,"" explains lead author Maximilian Kotz from PIK. ""Yet now, for the first time, we're also able to show that day-to-day variations in temperature, i.e. short-term variability, has a substantial impact. If this variability increases by one degree Celsius, economic growth is reduced on average by 5 percentage-points.""Particularly affected are economies in low-income regions of the global South, as co-author Leonie Wenz from PIK explains: ""We find that familiarity with temperature variations is important: Economies in Canada or Russia, where average monthly temperature varies by more than 40°C within a year, seem better prepared to cope with daily temperature fluctuations than low-latitude regions such as parts of Latin America or Southeast Asia, where seasonal temperature differences can be as small as 3°C. This is likely because farmers and small business owners have cultivated resilience against temperature variability.""""Furthermore, income protects against losses,"" Wenz adds. ""Even if at similar latitude, economies in poor regions are more strongly affected when daily temperature fluctuates than their counterparts in rich regions."" If the daily temperature deviates from seasonal expectations, fundamental elements of the economy are negatively impacted -- including crop yields, human health, sales and operational costs.Comparing each year's day-to-day temperature variability between 1979 and 2018 with the corresponding regional economic data, the researchers analyzed a total of 29,000 individual observations. ""Rapid temperature variability is something completely different than long-term changes,"" explains Co-Author Anders Levermann from PIK and Columbia University, New York.""The real problem caused by a changing climate are the unexpected impacts, because they are more difficult to adapt to. Farmers and other businesses around the world have started to adapt to climate change. But what if weather becomes simply more erratic and unpredictable?

Policy makers and industry need to take this into account when discussing the real cost of climate change.""",Climate,2021.0,"New research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) has found that day-to-day temperature fluctuations have a bigger impact on economic growth than previously thought.

134,8-Feb-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210208114312.htm,Better understanding the reasons behind Arctic's amplified warming,"It's clear that rising greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of global warming. But on a regional level, several other factors are at play. That's especially true in the Arctic -- a massive oceanic region around the North Pole which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. One consequence of the melting of the Arctic ice cap is a reduction in albedo, which is the capacity of surfaces to reflect a certain amount of solar radiation. Earth's bright surfaces like glaciers, snow and clouds have a high reflectivity. As snow and ice decrease, albedo decreases and more radiation is absorbed by the Earth, leading to a rise in near-surface temperature.","The other regional, yet much more complex factor that scientists need to pay detailed attention to relates to how clouds and aerosols interact. Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air; they come in a wide range of sizes and compositions and can occur naturally -- such as from sea spray, marine microbial emissions or forest fires (like in Siberia) -- or be produced by human activity, for exemple from the combustion of fossil fuels or agriculture. Without aerosols, clouds cannot form because they serve as the surface on which water molecules form droplets. Owing to this role, and more specifically to how they affect the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth surface, and the terrestrial radiation that leaves the Earth, aerosols are an essential element in regulating the climate and Arctic climate in particular.In a paper published in Schmale has carried out several research expeditions to the North Pole, most recently in early 2020 on the German icebreaker Polarstern. She saw first-hand that the Arctic climate tends to change fastest in the winter -- despite there being no albedo during this period of 24-hour darkness. Scientists still don't know why. One reason could be that clouds present in winter are reflecting the Earth's heat back down to the ground; this occurs to varying degrees depending on natural cycles and the amount of aerosol in the air. That would lift temperatures above the Arctic ice mass, but the process is extremely complicated due to the wide range of aerosol types and differences in their capacity to reflect and absorb light. ""Few observations have been made on this phenomenon because, in order to conduct research in the Arctic in the wintertime, you have to block off an icebreaker, scientists and research equipment for the entire season,"" says Schmale.Although many research expeditions have already been carried out in the Arctic, a lot remains to be explored. One option could be to collect all the discoveries made so far on Arctic warming and use them to improve existing weather models. ""A major effort is needed right away, otherwise we'll always be one step behind in understanding what's going on. The observations we've already made could be used to improve our models. A wealth of information is available, but it hasn't been sorted through in the right way to establish links between the different processes. For instance, our models currently can't tell us what kinds of aerosols contribute the most to climate change, whether local or anthropogenic,"" says Schmale.In their paper, the research team puts forth three steps that could be taken to gain better insight into the Arctic climate and the role played by aerosols. They suggest creating an interactive, open-source, virtual platform that compiles all Arctic knowledge to date. They point to the International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA) program as an example; the IASOA coordinates the activities of individual Arctic observatories to provide a collaborative international network for Arctic atmospheric research and operations. ""We need to improve our climate models because what's happening in the Arctic will eventually spread elsewhere. It's already affecting the climate in other parts of the northern hemisphere, as we've seen with the melting glaciers and rising sea levels in Greenland. And to develop better models, a better understanding of aerosols' role will be crucial. They have a major impact on the climate and on human health,"" says Schmale.",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists studying the Arctic climate must focus on the complex interaction between clouds and aerosols, according to a paper published in Nature. Aerosols are tiny particles that come in a range of sizes and compositions, and are essential for cloud formation. They also affect the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface and the terrestrial radiation that leaves it, making them key to regulating the climate.

They're also facing threats that are driving their decline, including the planet's warming waters.","This threat hit extreme levels in 2015, when high temperatures were turning corals white around the globe. Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii was hit hard; nearly half of its corals bleached.Hidden in the aftermath of this extreme event, however, were biochemical clues as to why some corals bleached while others were resistant, information that could help reefs better weather warming waters in the future. These clues have now been uncovered by researchers at Michigan State University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa.""It was kind of horrifying,"" said coral biologist Crawford Drury, who witnessed 2015's bleaching event from Florida before joining UH Manoa's Hawaii Institute for Marine Biology, or HIMB. ""It's disheartening to watch, but I try to think of it as an opportunity.""How this disturbing event became an opportunity is now clear thanks to a Feb. 8 report in The researchers discovered chemical signatures in the corals' biology, or biomarkers, that are present in organisms that were most resistant to the bleaching. This previously hidden insight could help researchers and conservationists better restore and protect reefs around the world.""Usually, we think of biomarkers as signatures of disease, but this could be a signature of health,"" said MSU's Robert Quinn, an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. ""This could help us restore reefs with the most resistant stock.""Corals are symbiotic communities where coral animal cells build homes for algae that provide them energy and create their colors. When corals bleach, however, the algae are lost and leave behind skeletons that are susceptible to disease and death.This symbiosis also plays a role in a coral's resistance and resilience to bleaching, which HIMB was in a unique position to investigate -- literally. The institute sits right next to the reef, enabling experiments in real time.""The reef is about 100 feet away,"" Drury said. ""I could be there in 30 seconds.""During the 2015 bleaching event, researchers in the Gates Coral Lab at HIMB had tagged individual corals to keep tabs on them. Because most of the corals recovered, the team could follow them over time.""We think about it as a biological library,"" said Drury, the principal investigator with the Gates Coral Lab. ""It was set up by researchers in our lab who knew it would be very valuable.""Following the bleaching, the team compared and contrasted coral samples in the wild, noting how the organisms responded and recovered, making some surprising observations along the way. For example, neighboring corals could behave completely differently in response to high temperatures. One coral could bleach completely while its neighbor maintained a healthy golden hue.To understand why, Drury and HIMB postdoctoral researcher Ty Roach, the lead author of the study, sent samples to Quinn at MSU. Here, Quinn and his team could thoroughly analyze the biochemicals of corals collected from this biological library using a method called metabolomics.""I'm known more for my medical work,"" said Quinn, who studies the biochemistry of health and disease in humans. ""But I've always loved ocean science. My background is in marine microbiology.""If the coral samples are the books in the library, Quinn's lab used sophisticated equipment to reveal the biochemical language within. In particular, his team used tools known as mass spectrometers to understand what set resistant corals apart from susceptible ones.""The corals are completely different in their chemistry, but you can't tell until you run the mass spec,"" Quinn said. ""These mass specs are some of the most advanced technology on the planet.""Quinn's team found that corals that were resistant to bleaching and those that were susceptible hosted two different communities of algae. The distinguishing feature between these algal populations was found in their cells, in compounds known as lipids.The researchers' metabolomic analysis detected two different lipid formulations. Bleaching-resistant corals featured algae that have what are known as saturated lipids. Susceptible corals had more unsaturated lipids.""This is not unlike the difference between oil and margarine, the latter having more saturated fat, making it solid at room temperature,"" Quinn said.This discovery poses all sorts of new questions for researchers: How do the corals get these different algae? Is this difference unique to Hawaiian corals or can it be found elsewhere? How can researchers promote the growth and proliferation of resilient corals in a warming world?""Mass specs are such incredible machines and reveal intricate details of the chemistry involved. The biology is really the hard part."" Quinn said. ""We're working on new grants. There are so many avenues to explore.""This initial project was funded by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.""This collaboration has been a great opportunity to ask and answer questions,"" Drury said. ""Hopefully, we're just getting started.""In the meantime, having this chemical information is promising for coral conservation. When conservationists reseed corals to help restore reefs, they can potentially select more resilient specimens.""We can use natural resilience to better understand, support and manage coral reefs under climate change,"" Drury said.""Conservation biology has some of the more successful stories in modern scientific history,"" Quinn said, pointing to the resurgence of elk in Virginia and bald eagles in Michigan. ""Someday, maybe we can add corals to that list.""",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from Michigan State University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa have identified biomarkers in coral reefs that could help protect them from bleaching.

The Donahue lab has been a longtime member of the CERN CLOUD experiment, an international collaboration of scientists that use a special chamber at CERN in Switzerland to remedy that uncertainty by studying how cosmic rays affect the formation of particles and clouds in the atmosphere. The chamber allows researchers to precisely mix vaporous compounds and observe how particles form and grow from them.In a study published today in the journal ""This represents a new pathway for particle formation, which in turn governs the properties of clouds in the marine atmosphere,"" Donahue said.Building on previous research his lab conducted on discovering a new rapid mechanism for atmospheric particle formation from nitric acid and ammonia vapors, Donahue and his team have now helped the CLOUD collaboration discover that the nucleation rates of iodic acid particles are very fast. This means that increasing concentrations of iodine-containing vapors in the atmosphere can lead to large increases in the number of particles that form clouds.Specifically, Donahue and his collaborators, including current Ph.D. candidates Mingyi Wang and Victoria Hofbauer, alumna Qing Ye and former postdoctoral scholar Dexian Chen, contributed their use of a state-of-the-art chemical ionization mass spectrometer that can measure the amount and composition of extremely small particles less than 10 nanometers in size just following their formation.""The CMU measurements showed that the newly formed particles are composed largely of iodic acid, confirming that this critical molecule not only is present as a vapor while particles are forming but definitively drives their growth,"" Donahue said.While clouds forming may sound like a relatively benign outcome, clouds play an important role in regulating Earth's temperature because they are highly reflective. Much of the sun's energy is reflected by clouds back into space, keeping Earth from becoming too hot. However, that reflectivity can work both ways, which is a particular problem at Earth's poles. Typically, the white snow and ice surfaces reflect a lot of sunlight back into space, thus keeping the surface there cool. However, increased cloud formation in those regions can mean that the light reflected off the surface can be reflected back onto the ice and snow by the cloud cover.""The Arctic is an especially vulnerable region, with twice the rate of warming and the huge consequences of both sea ice and ice sheet melting,"" Donahue said. He and his lab are already planning future research into the complex feedbacks between iodic acid and sulfur compounds and how these affect the polar atmosphere and climate change.""We have a great deal more to learn in this area, especially regarding the interactions of the iodine compounds and particles, and dimethyl sulfide oxidation and its particle formation,"" Donahue said.",Climate,2021.0,"Chemists at Carnegie Mellon University have helped to discover a new pathway for atmospheric particle formation, which could have significant implications for climate change.

One reason is that plants bind CO,"As in previous analyses, the scientists used a global, flexible and modular economic model developed at the University of Bonn to simulate the impact of rising supply for bioplastics. The model is based on a world database (Global Trade Analysis Project). For their current study, the researchers modified the original model by disaggregating both conventional plastics and bioplastics, as well as additional crops such as maize and cassava. ""This is crucial to better represent the bioplastics supply chain in major producing regions and assess their environmental impacts from a life cycle perspective,"" emphasizes agricultural engineer Dr. Neus Escobar, who conducted the study at the Institute for Food and Resource Economics (ILR) and the Center for Development Research (ZEF) at the University of Bonn and is now based at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg (Austria).In the current study, she and her colleague Dr. Wolfgang Britz considered the loss of natural vegetation on a global scale. They made estimates of readily available land to be converted into productive uses at the region level and associated model parameters. In their previous publication, the Bonn scientists had already disaggregated the production of conventional plastics and bioplastics in Brazil, China, the EU and the U.S. -- the countries that lead the way in bioplastics production. In their current study, they also included Thailand, which is home of carbon-rich forests. Experts expect the Asian country to become a leading global producer of biodegradable and biobased plastics in the near future. ""All these changes in the model are necessary to estimate global spillovers of policies or technologies,"" says Dr. Wolfgang Britz, who worked with his team on the extension of the model to derive sustainability indicators considering global land use change.The researchers simulated a total of 180 scenarios (36 scenarios per region) that varied according to the degree of bioplastics market penetration and other model parameters determining economywide responses. ""We found that the carbon footprints of commercially available bioplastics are much larger than the values previously estimated in scientific literature and policy reports,"" says Neus Escobar.The reason: COThe overall calculations show that none of the regions is clearly better positioned than another to become a hub for sustainable bioplastics production. The largest land footprints are estimated for Chinese bioplastics, while the European Union has the largest average carbon footprint: Bioplastics produced in the EU take an average of 232.5 years to offset global CO""Our study shows that an expansion in bio-based production should be carefully assessed on a region-by-region case in order to understand potentially sustainability risks and trade-offs,"" says Neus Escobar. The authors emphasize that the proposed metrics can be used in the future to monitor the long-term sustainability of bioeconomic interventions globally. Among other things, the metrics could help identify where complementary policies are needed -- for example, to prevent deforestation.The study is thematically embedded in the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) ""Innovation and Technology for Sustainable Futures"" at the University of Bonn. In six different TRAs, scientists from a wide range of faculties and disciplines come together to work on future-relevant research topics.

The three-dimensional structure of forests plays an important role here because it influences processes of gas and energy exchange with the atmosphere, whilst also providing habitats for numerous species. An international research team led by the University of Göttingen has investigated the variety of different complex structures that can be found in the world's forests, as well as the factors that explain this diversity. The results have been published in ","The researchers investigated the structure of primeval forests on several continents in different climate zones. To achieve this, they spent two years travelling to remote primeval forest areas around the world to record the structure of the forests with the help of 3D laser scanners. A laser scanner captures the environment with the help of a laser beam and thus builds a 3D representation of the forest. This allows important metrics to be calculated to describe the structure. They found that the global variability of forest structures can be explained to a large extent by the amount of precipitation and thus by the availability of water in the different ecosystems. Based on these findings and with the help of climate data, they were able to create maps of the world's forests showing the global variability of structural complexity.The world maps describe the structures that forests can develop free from human influence. Only 30 percent of the world's forests are still primeval forests. ""A long-term goal of our research is to better understand how human influence and climate change affect the forest, its structure and the processes linked to it. The structure of primeval forests is an important reference point for this,"" says first author Dr Martin Ehbrecht from the University of Göttingen. A particular focus here is the question of how changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change affect the structure of forests. ""The importance of water for the formation of complex forest structures can be explained by various interacting mechanisms,"" says Ehbrecht. ""The availability of water is an important driver of the diversity of tree species. The more tree species a forest holds, the more pronounced is the coexistence of different crown shapes and sizes of trees. This means that the space available for the crowns of trees can often be utilised more efficiently in species-rich forests, which makes the forest structure more complex.""Tropical rainforests have a more complex structure than the deciduous and coniferous forests found in temperate zones, which are in turn generally more complex in structure than boreal coniferous forests such as those in Scandinavia, or subtropical forest savannahs in Africa. ""Nevertheless, forests with high structural complexity can also be found in temperate zones, such as in areas with a high rainfall like the Pacific Northwest of the USA or in coastal forests of Chile,"" says Professor Ammer, senior author of the study and head of Silviculture and Forest Ecology of Temperate Zones at Göttingen University.The results of this study are an important starting point for further work. ""With the help of satellite-based recording of 3-D forest structure, in the future it will be possible to precisely record the actual complexity of forests,"" says Ehbrecht. ""This will make it possible to better understand the effects of forest management and climate change on the world's forests.

Climatic changes including increases in temperature, sunlight, and atmospheric carbon dioxide -- which affect the growth of plants and trees -- have changed natural habitats from tropical shrubland to tropical savannah and deciduous woodland. This created a suitable environment for many bat species that predominantly live in forests.The number of coronaviruses in an area is closely linked to the number of different bat species present. The study found that an additional 40 bat species have moved into the southern Chinese Yunnan province in the past century, harbouring around 100 more types of bat-borne coronavirus. This 'global hotspot' is the region where genetic data suggests SARS-CoV-2 may have arisen.""Climate change over the last century has made the habitat in the southern Chinese Yunnan province suitable for more bat species,"" said Dr Robert Beyer, a researcher in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology and first author of the study, who has recently taken up a European research fellowship at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany.He added: ""Understanding how the global distribution of bat species has shifted as a result of climate change may be an important step in reconstructing the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak.""To get their results, the researchers created a map of the world's vegetation as it was a century ago, using records of temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover. Then they used information on the vegetation requirements of the world's bat species to work out the global distribution of each species in the early 1900s. Comparing this to current distributions allowed them to see how bat 'species richness', the number of different species, has changed across the globe over the last century due to climate change.""As climate change altered habitats, species left some areas and moved into others -- taking their viruses with them. This not only altered the regions where viruses are present, but most likely allowed for new interactions between animals and viruses, causing more harmful viruses to be transmitted or evolve,"" said Beyer.The world's bat population carries around 3,000 different types of coronavirus, with each bat species harbouring an average of 2.7 coronaviruses -- most without showing symptoms. An increase in the number of bat species in a particular region, driven by climate change, may increase the likelihood that a coronavirus harmful to humans is present, transmitted, or evolves there.Most coronaviruses carried by bats cannot jump into humans. But several coronaviruses known to infect humans are very likely to have originated in bats, including three that can cause human fatalities: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV-1 and CoV-2.The region identified by the study as a hotspot for a climate-driven increase in bat species richness is also home to pangolins, which are suggested to have acted as intermediate hosts to SARS-CoV-2. The virus is likely to have jumped from bats to these animals, which were then sold at a wildlife market in Wuhan -- where the initial human outbreak occurred.The researchers echo calls from previous studies that urge policy-makers to acknowledge the role of climate change in outbreaks of viral diseases, and to address climate change as part of COVID-19 economic recovery programmes.""The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous social and economic damage. Governments must seize the opportunity to reduce health risks from infectious diseases by taking decisive action to mitigate climate change,"" said Professor Andrea Manica in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, who was involved in the study.""The fact that climate change can accelerate the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans should be an urgent wake-up call to reduce global emissions,"" added Professor Camilo Mora at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, who initiated the project.The researchers emphasised the need to limit the expansion of urban areas, farmland, and hunting grounds into natural habitat to reduce contact between humans and disease-carrying animals.The study showed that over the last century, climate change has also driven increases in the number of bat species in regions around Central Africa, and scattered patches in Central and South America.",Climate,2021.0,"Climate change has led to large-scale changes in vegetation in southern China's Yunnan province, Myanmar and Laos over the past century, creating an environment suitable for many bat species that predominantly live in forests.

145,4-Feb-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210204143218.htm,"In a desert seared by climate change, burrowers fare better than birds","In the arid Mojave Desert, small burrowing mammals like the cactus mouse, the kangaroo rat and the white-tailed antelope squirrel are weathering the hotter, drier conditions triggered by climate change much better than their winged counterparts, finds a new study published today in ","Over the past century, climate change has continuously nudged the Mojave's searing summer temperatures ever higher, and the blazing heat has taken its toll on the desert's birds. Researchers have documented a collapse in the region's bird populations, likely resulting from many bird species' inability to withstand these new hotter temperaturesHowever, the same team that documented the birds' decline has now found that small mammal populations in the desert have remained relatively stable since the beginning of the 20th century.Using computer models to simulate how birds and mammals respond to heat, the study team showed that small mammals' resilience is likely due to their ability to escape the sun in underground burrows and their tendency to be more active at night. As a result of these behaviors, small mammals have much lower ""cooling costs"" than birds, which have less capacity to escape the desert heat and need extra water to maintain a healthy body temperature.""Scientists tend to assume that most species in a region experience the same exposure to temperature or precipitation changes, and that they all respond in the same way. But we're finding now that animals have diverse strategies for reducing their exposure to hot and dry conditions that could kill them,"" said study senior author Steven Beissinger, a University of California, Berkeley, professor of environmental science, policy and management and a researcher at the campus's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. ""You should see these differences most strongly in a harsh environment like the desert, where life is really on the edge.""The findings are part of UC Berkeley's Grinnell Resurvey Project, an effort to revisit and document wildlife at sites in California first studied by UC Berkeley biologist Joseph Grinnell and his colleagues at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology between 1904 and 1940. Grinnell's detailed field notes of the animal and plant life of the early 20th century have given modern-day biologists a glimpse into the ecology of the past, allowing them to document how climate change has impacted wildlife throughout the state.""It's becoming clear that animals across the planet are responding to climate change by shifting where they live and shifting when they breed, and we're starting to get really strong evidence of population declines in certain areas that may be associated with warming,"" said lead author Eric Riddell, an assistant professor of ecology, evolution and organismal biology at Iowa State University. ""Some estimates now suggest that one in six species will be threatened by climate change over the next century. Figuring out which species those are, what kind of traits they have, will be critical.""In recent years, the Grinnell Resurvey Project has turned its focus to ecological change in the Mojave Desert, an area in Southern California and Nevada that is home to Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and the Mojave National Preserve. As a whole, the desert has seen an approximate 2 C (3.6 F) increase in average mean temperature and a 10 to 20% decrease in precipitation over the last century.""Desert species have been thought to be relatively invulnerable to climate warming, but many desert species are already at or near their temperature and aridity tolerance limits. Each species also has different degrees of resilience,"" said study co-author Lori Hargrove, an ecologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. ""Climate change may seem minor, only a few degrees, but it has already had, and is having, direct and significant impacts on many species, each of which, in turn, affects other species, with cascading effects yet to be realized.""While there was no such thing as GPS when Grinnell and his colleagues conducted their surveys, they left behind detailed field notes of landscape features like hills, mountains and streams, that have allowed current day scientists to pinpoint their locations to within less than a kilometer, even in desolate regions like the Mojave Desert.""Sometimes they were very nice and left topo maps, but sometimes you have to do a little detective work,"" said Beissinger, who leads the Grinnell Resurvey Project. ""For instance, they will say, 'We sampled at Horse Mountain.' Well, there are three Horse Mountains in California. So, we track down the Horse Mountain in the study region. And then you find out that they camped at the mouth of a creek. So, then you look at the old topo maps, and you see the creek. Using these details, we're able to recreate more or less where they were.""Once the researchers identify a location, the next step is to take stock of what animals live there. To survey bird populations, researchers will pick a specific trail or route to walk for 1.5 miles and stop at defined intervals to record all the birds they see -- or, more likely, hear.""You have to know your bird songs,"" Beissinger said.Small mammal surveys are a little trickier. Because small mammals are often more active at night and usually spend the daylight hours hiding away in burrows, researchers rely on live traps to get an idea of which animals are around.Co-author James Patton, a professor emeritus of integrative biology and curator in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley, led the trapping efforts with his wife, Carol, in Mojave's Death Valley National Park. To sample a given location, Patton said that they would set a series of approximately 200 traps each night for four or five nights and record what they caught.""To be a fieldworker, you have to have sufficient experience with the local fauna to know that you're sampling the diversity of habitats that are actually occupied. That means variations in plant community and substrate, such as whether the ground surface is sandy, rocky or hardpan,"" said Patton, who has been involved in the Grinnell Resurvey Project since its inception in 2003.Researchers on Beissinger's team have adapted statistical models that account for differences in survey methods and detection between Grinnell's time and today, allowing them to directly compare species diversity and prevalence between the early 20th century and now. The new study's findings are based on multiday surveys of 34 small mammal species at 90 sites and 135 bird species at 61 sites located primarily on Mojave Desert protected lands and national parks.In 2018, the team reported its findings that bird populations have declined precipitously, with the 61 sites losing, on average, 43% of the species that were there a century ago. However, according to the new trapping data, small mammal populations have not significantly changed since then.""Mammals have shown this remarkable stability,"" Beissinger said. ""It's really quite interesting that, in the same region, with the same level of climate change, these two very similar taxa have responded very differently to the changes taking place.""Desert animals have devised a variety of different tricks for staying cool in the dry heat. Unlike humans, birds and small mammals do not sweat. However, some rely on other methods of evaporative cooling, such as panting or ""gular flutter,"" a vibration of a bird's throat muscles that increases air flow. Others will avoid the heat by staying in the shade, or by building dens or burrows to hide from the sun. Some avoid the heat of the day altogether by being nocturnal.As a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, Riddell built computer models of 49 desert birds to calculate each species' body temperature and cooling needs under different desert conditions. Birds that the model predicted would have the greatest increase in cooling costs were also the ones that showed the greatest losses in field surveys -- particularly larger birds, and those that have an insect or animal diet.For the new study, Riddell built additional physiological models, this time for small mammals of the desert.""The simulations estimate the head loads that animals experience and then calculates how much heat they need to gain or lose to maintain a stable body temperature,"" Riddell said. ""It's very similar to how your house controls the temperature. You probably want to keep your house temperature pretty constant throughout the seasons, and keeping your house warm or cool depends on what your house is made of: What are its properties? How thick are the walls? How much sun hits it? These are the types of characteristics that I measured for birds and mammals.""For instance, he said, a black crow will absorb more sunlight than a lighter colored bird. However, the shape of the animal, the thickness of the plumage or fur and the length of the individual fibers will all determine how much sunlight is able to pass through the feathers and hit the skin of the animal.For small mammals, Riddell was also interested in how quickly heat is able to transfer through their fur. To calculate this, he used specimens currently stored at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. By placing the fur samples on a heated device, and placing thermocouples at the tips of the hairs, he was able to get an estimate of each animal's thermal conductance.""Thermal conductance is basically how quickly something transfers heat with its environment,"" Riddell said. ""A big, fluffy mammal might transfer heat very slowly, whereas an animal with very sparse or short fur, like a ground squirrel, might transfer heat quickly.""The models also included different heat sources an animal might be exposed to, such as direct solar radiation, solar radiation reflected from the ground, and infrared radiation from the ground, known as longwave radiation.According to the models, cooling costs were, on average, about 3.3-fold higher for birds than they were for small mammals. Higher temperatures associated with climate change increased cooling costs by 58% for birds, but only 17% for mammals. This was largely due to the fact that the small mammals can retreat to underground burrows during the hottest parts of the day.""A lot of the difference in cooling costs is related to what we call microhabitat differences. Small mammals are able to go underground where it is much cooler, and they're not being exposed to the direct sunlight, which heats up the bodies of the birds,"" Beissinger said. ""These microgeographic variations in their exposure make a big difference, and these variations need to be considered when we think about how climate change will impact individual species.""To prevent further losses, Beissinger says it will be important to identify local refuges in the desert where species will be able to maintain themselves when temperatures soar. Reducing the demand on aquifers in the region may also prevent more desert springs from drying up, returning more water to the parched landscape.""This study has made me realize just how complicated predicting the effects of climate change truly are,"" Riddell said. ""It isn't just about where the landscape is warming and where it isn't warming. It's a really complex process that involves many aspects of an organism's biology, including their physiology, their behavior, their evolution -- it's all coupled. You need to take a really integrative approach to understand it.""",Climate,2021.0,"Small mammals in the Mojave Desert have remained relatively stable since the beginning of the 20th century, despite the region's searing summer temperatures increasing due to climate change, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley.

This could be because farmers are better prepared to frighten off elephants. It could also be because landcover change makes it harder for elephants to hide in forest patches, and this spread of farmland and loss of forest to illegal charcoal clearing means that more of the crop-raiding incidents are taking place closer to the protected area.Professor Smith said: 'Landcover change has had a major impact on where human-elephant conflict takes place. Better land-use planning and support for farmers would help reduce crop-raiding as well as people's tolerance of elephants.'Lydia Tiller said: 'The change in crop-raiding trends going from being highly seasonal during 1999-2000 when maize crops are ripe, to year-round during 2014-2015, is yet another demonstration of how climate change is affecting nature.

For the first time, scientists at the University of Oxford and the University of Washington have directly linked human-induced climate change to the risk of flooding from a glacial lake known as one of the world's greatest flood risks.","The study examined the case of Lake Palcacocha in the Peruvian Andes, which could cause flooding with devastating consequences for 120,000 residents in the city of Huaraz. The paper, published Feb. 4 in ""The scientific challenge was to provide the clearest and cleanest assessment of the physical linkages between climate change and the changing flood hazard,"" said co-author Gerard Roe, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences.In 2016, Roe and colleagues developed a method to determine whether an individual glacier's retreat can be linked to human-induced climate change. The retreat of mountain glaciers has several consequences, including creating basins in the space left by the retreating glacier. Precipitation and meltwater collects in these basins to form glacial lakes. Recent work has shown a rapid worldwide growth in the number and size of high-elevation glacial lakes.""We believe our study is the first to assess the full set of linkages between anthropogenic climate change and the changing glacial lake outburst flood hazard,"" Roe said. ""The methods used in our study can certainly be applied to other glacial lakes around the world.""The new study first calculated the role of human emissions in the observed temperature increase since the start of the industrial era around Palcaraju Glacier. It finds that human activity is responsible for 95% of the observed 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warming in this region since 1880.The authors then used the UW-developed technique to assess the relationship between these warming temperatures and the observed long-term retreat of the glacier that has caused Lake Palcacocha to expand. Results show it is virtually certain, with greater than 99% probability, that human-induced climate change has caused Palcaraju Glacier's retreat.Lead author Rupert Stuart-Smith, a doctoral student at Oxford, then used two methods to assess the hazard of glacial lake outburst flooding, in which an avalanche, landslide or rockfall induces a tsunami wave that overtops the lake's banks, to pinpoint how Lake Palcacocha's growth affects the flood risk faced by the city of Huaraz below.""We found that human influence on climate -- through greenhouse-gas emissions -- is responsible for virtually all of the warming that has been observed in the region,"" said Stuart-Smith, who spent the summer of 2019 at the UW. ""The study shows that warming has caused the retreat of the Palcaraju Glacier, which in turn has greatly increased the flood risk.""The study provides new evidence for an ongoing case in the German courts in which Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a farmer from Huaraz, has sued RWE, Germany's largest electricity producer, for its role in creating global warming. The suit seeks reimbursement for current and future flood-risk reduction measures.""Crucially, our findings establish a direct link between emissions and the need to implement protective measures now, as well as any damages caused by flooding in the future,"" Stuart-Smith said.This is not the first time Huaraz has been threatened by climate change. In 1941, an outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha, resulting from an ice and rock slide, killed at least 1,800 people. The study also found this flood to be influenced by human-induced climate change -- making it one of the earliest identified fatal impacts of climate change.The lake's recent growth strains decades of engineering efforts since the 1970s to contain the lake's water.""Around the world, the retreat of mountain glaciers is one of the clearest indicators of climate change,"" Roe said. ""Outburst floods threaten communities in many mountainous regions, but this risk is particularly severe in Huaraz, as well as elsewhere in the Andes and in countries like Nepal and Bhutan, where vulnerable populations live in the path of the potential floodwaters.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new study has found that human-induced climate change is responsible for the retreat of the Palcaraju Glacier in the Peruvian Andes, which has caused Lake Palcacocha to expand and significantly increased the flood risk faced by the city of Huaraz.

The study cannot confirm the shift is connected to climate change, but the results are consistent with climate models that predict drier autumns for California in a warming climate, according to the authors.","Wildfires can occur at any time in California, but fires typically burn from May through October, when the state is in its dry season. The start of the rainy season, historically in November, ends wildfire season as plants become too moist to burn.California's rainy season has been starting progressively later in recent decades and climate scientists have projected it will get shorter as the climate warms. In the new study, researchers analyzed rainfall and weather data in California over the past six decades. The results show the official onset of California's rainy season is 27 days later than it was in the 1960s and the rain that does fall is being concentrated during the months of January and February.""What we've shown is that it will not happen in the future, it's happening already,"" said Jelena Lukovi?, a climate scientist at the University of Belgrade in Serbia and lead author of the new study. ""The onset of the rainy season has been progressively delayed since the 1960s, and as a result the precipitation season has become shorter and sharper in California.""The new study in AGU's journal The results suggest California's wildfire season, which has been getting progressively worse due to human-caused climate change, will last even longer in the years to come and Californians can expect to see more fires flaring up in the month of November. 2020 was California's worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 10,000 fires burning more than 4.2 million acres of land.An extended dry season means there is more overlap between wildfire season and the influx of Santa Ana winds that bring hot, dry weather to California in the fall. These winds can fan the flames of wildfires and increase the risk of late-season fires getting out of hand.""It's not just a matter of making the vegetation drier and keeping all else equal,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study. ""You're also increasing the number of opportunities for extremely dry vegetation and extremely strong offshore winds to coincide.""The delay in the start of the rainy season is likely due to changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns that bring precipitation to the West Coast, according to the study authors. They found the atmospheric circulation pattern that dominates California during the summer is extending into fall across the north Pacific Ocean. This change is bringing more rain to the states of Washington and Oregon and leaving California high and dry.The changes mean Californians will need to better plan how they manage water resources and energy production -- a longer dry season means more irrigation is needed for crops in an already water-stressed state.""All water-sensitive stakeholders should have this information and plan their management accordingly,"" Lukovi? said.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study shows that California's rainy season is starting 27 days later than it did in the 1960s, and the rain that does fall is being concentrated in January and February.

Before, in many locations, extreme wind-load estimates on projects were uncertain due to limited on-site measurements.By the end of 2019, total global wind turbine installed capacity was more than 651 gigawatts (GW), according to the paper, thanks to 60 GW of recently built capacity -- of which nearly 90% was placed onshore. ""Thus, wind is now generating over 1,700 terawatt hours of electricity per year or about 7.5% of the global electricity supply,"" Pryor said.Barthelmie and Pryor report that the United States carries 17% of the world's current wind energy installed capacity, while Europe (31%) and China (36%) carry more.There are now wind turbines generating carbon-free electricity in more than 90 countries, Pryor said.Development of research product was motivated by a need from the wind-energy industry, Barthelmie said.

It provides most of the vegetation to the area and serves as a home for the local indigenous people, and migration corridor for many animals. The overall vegetation cover increased by 33% between 1984 and 2019, according to a Dartmouth study published in ","The study leveraged recent drone imagery and past satellite imagery to estimate past vegetation cover in this linear oasis of the Kuiseb River, a fertile area in the middle of one of the driest deserts on the earth. The findings are significant, as this is the first study to reconstruct decades of vegetation change over a long stretch of the river, rather than at just a few sites.The research was based on a senior thesis project by Bryn E. Morgan '17, first author of the study, who has a bachelor's degree in geography and chemistry from Dartmouth, and is now a Ph.D. student in the WAVES Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She first visited the Namib Desert, which is located along the coast of Namibia, in 2015 as part of the environmental studies foreign studies program , led by study co-author Douglas T. Bolger, a professor and chair of environmental studies at Dartmouth. Morgan returned to the region on her own in 2016, to conduct this research while working out of the Gobabeb Namib Research Institute and continued this work after graduating from Dartmouth.The study area consisted of a 112-kilometer stretch of the lower Kuiseb River, which was comprised of 12 sites along the river, each of which was 500 meters wide. At each site, Morgan flew one to four unmanned aerial vehicle or drone flights to capture images of the woody vegetation cover along the river. One drone flight would take images with true color and then another flight would take images with false color using near infrared wavelengths of light, which are outside what our eyes can see. False color imagery allows one to distinguish vegetation from sand and soil, and differentiate the various types of vegetation and how healthy it may be.The drone imagery revealed that five species of trees are part of the vegetation cover in the area: Acacia (Vachellia) erioloba, Faidherbia albida, Euclea pseudebenus, Tamrix usneoides, and Salvadora persica. A. erioloba and F. albida have been named national conservation priorities and their pods are an important food source to the livestock of the Topnaar (?Aonin), the indigenous people who live along the Kuiseb River. The Kuiseb also serves as a habitat and migration corridor for many animals, including the mountain zebra, leopard and ostrich.Based on the 2016 data, the research team created a model that calculated the fractional vegetation cover of the lower Kuiseb River based on raw reflectance values. By matching past satellite images for the previous 30 years to the present-day imagery, and then applying the same model, the team was able to estimate past and vegetation cover. ""Essentially, the drone data worked as a bridge from the ground to what the satellite was seeing,"" explains co-author Jonathan Chipman , director of the Citrin Family GIS/Applied Spatial Analysis Laboratory at Dartmouth. ""Our methods in the study provide a model for how ecologists can combine modern drone imagery and historic satellite data to reconstruct past environmental change.""The results showed that one area of the Kuiseb River located between 110 and 140 kilometers upstream from the Atlantic Ocean in the terminal alluvial zone, which is typically dry but within the reach of floods and where soil sediments are deposited, not only had the highest vegetation but also had the most positive change in vegetation cover over the study period.""Our findings demonstrate that vegetation cover in the lower Kuiseb River has been, on average, increasing for more than three decades,"" says Morgan. ""As a result, we provide new insight into not only the long-term change in the hydrology and ecology of this system but also into how ephemeral rivers in desert landscapes might be responding to global change.""The research team examined the climate and hydrological records to see if increased precipitation between 1984 and 2019 may explain the overall change in vegetation cover; however, the records did not show such steady increases in precipitation. According to the co-authors, the increase in vegetation cover may reflect a long-term recovery from the drought in the Namib Desert during the early 1980s, which could be investigated by using coarser-resolution satellite data prior to 1984.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from Dartmouth College and the University of California, Santa Barbara, have used drone imagery and past satellite imagery to estimate past vegetation cover in the Kuiseb River, a fertile area in the Namib Desert.

151,3-Feb-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210203123449.htm,The Arctic Ocean was covered by a shelf ice and filled with freshwater,"The Arctic Ocean was covered by up to 900 m thick shelf ice and was filled entirely with freshwater at least twice in the last 150,000 years. This surprising finding, reported in the latest issue of the journal ","About 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, in a particularly cold part of the last glacial period, large parts of Northern Europe and North America were covered by ice sheets. The European ice sheet spanned a distance of more than 5000 kilometres, from Ireland and Scotland via Scandinavia to the Eastern rim of the Kara Sea (Arctic Ocean). In North America, large parts of what is now known as Canada were buried under two large ice sheets. Greenland and parts of the Bering Sea coastline were glaciated too. What was the ice situation like even further North, in the Arctic Ocean? Was it covered by thick sea-ice, or maybe with the tongues of these vast ice sheets were floating on it, far beyond the North Pole?Scientific answers to these questions were more or less hypothetical so far. In contrast to deposits on land, where erratic boulders, moraines and glacial valleys are the obvious landmarks of glaciers, only few traces of vast ice shelves had been found so far in the Arctic Ocean. Geoscientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have now compiled existing evidence from the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, and combined it with new data to arrive at a surprising conclusion.According to their study, the floating parts of the northern ice sheets covered large parts of the Arctic Ocean in the past 150,000 years. Once about 70,000-60,000 years ago and also about 150,000-130,000 years ago. In both periods, freshwater accumulated under the ice, creating a completely fresh Arctic Ocean for thousands of years.""These results mean a real change to our understanding of the Arctic Ocean in glacial climates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete freshening of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas has been considered -- happening not just once, but twice,"" says the first author, Dr Walter Geibert, geochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute.Their finding is based on geological analyses of ten sediment cores from different parts of the Arctic Ocean, Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas. The stacked deposits mirror the climate history of the past glacials. When investigating and comparing the sediment records, the geoscientists found that an important indicator was missing, always in the same two intervals. ""In saline sea water, the decay of naturally occurring uranium always results in the production of the isotope thorium-230. This substance accumulates at the sea floor, where it remains detectable for a very long time due to its half-life of 75,000 years,"" Walter Geibert explains.Therefore, geologists often use this thorium-isotope as a natural clock. ""Here, its repeated and wide-spread absence is the giveaway that reveals to us what happened. According to our knowledge, the only reasonable explanation for this pattern is that the Arctic Ocean was filled with freshwater twice in its younger history- in frozen and liquid form,"" co-author and micropalaeontologist Dr Jutta Wollenburg, also from the AWI, explains.How can a large ocean basin, connected by several straits with the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, turn entirely fresh? ""Such a scenario is perceivable if we realize that in glacial periods, global sea levels were up to 130 m lower than today, and ice masses in the Arctic may have restricted ocean circulation even further,"" states co-author Professor Ruediger Stein, geologist at the AWI and the MARUM.Shallow connections like Bering Strait or the sounds of the Canadian Archipelago were above sea level at the time, cutting off the connection with the Pacific Ocean entirely. In the Nordic Seas, large icebergs or ice sheets extending onto the sea floor restricted the exchange of water masses. The flow of glaciers, ice melt in summer, and rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean kept delivering large amounts of fresh water to the system, at least 1200 cubic kilometres per year. A part of this amount would have been forced via the Nordic Seas through the sparse narrow deeper connections in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the North Atlantic, hindering saline water from penetrating further north. This resulted in the freshening of the Arctic Ocean.""Once the mechanism of ice barriers failed, heavier saline water could fill the Arctic Ocean again,"" Walter Geibert says. ""We believe that it could then quickly displace the lighter freshwater, resulting in a sudden discharge of the accumulated amount of freshwater over the shallow southern boundary of the Nordic Seas, the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge, into the North Atlantic.""A concept that assumes that enormous amounts of freshwater were stored in the Arctic Ocean and available for rapid release would help understanding the connection between a range of past climate fluctuations. It would also offer an explanation for some apparent discrepancies between different ways of reconstructing past sea levels. ""The remains of coral reefs have pointed to a somewhat higher sea level in certain cold periods than reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores, or reconstructions from the calcareous shells of small marine organisms, would suggest,"" explains Walter Geibert. ""If we now accept that freshwater may not only have been stored in solid form on land, but some of it also in liquid form in the ocean, the different sea level reconstructions agree better and we can reconcile the location of the coral reefs with calculations of the freshwater budget.""Freshwater release from the Arctic Ocean might also serve as an explanation for some abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period. During such events, temperatures in Greenland could rise by 8-10 degree centigrade within a few years, only returning to the original cold glacial temperatures over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. ""We see an example here of a past Arctic climate tipping point of the Earth system. Now we need to investigate in more detail how these processes were interconnected, and evaluate how this new concept of the Arctic Ocean helps in closing further gaps in our knowledge, in particular in view of the risks of humanmade climate change,"" says Walter Geibert.",Climate,2021.0,"The Arctic Ocean was completely fresh for thousands of years, twice in the past 150,000 years, according to a study by geoscientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research and the MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences.

The findings are published in the British Ecological Society's ","The researchers from the University of Aberdeen looked at four of the most important commercial fish species in the North Sea and the West of Scotland: cod, haddock, whiting and saithe. They found that juvenile fish in the North Sea and on the West of Scotland have been getting bigger while adult fish have been getting smaller. These changes in body size correlated with rising sea temperatures in both regions.Idongesit Ikpewe, lead author of the study, said: ""Both the changes in juvenile and adult size coincided with increasing sea temperature. Importantly, we observed this pattern in both the North Sea, which has warmed rapidly, and the west of Scotland, which has only experienced moderate warming. These findings suggest that even a moderate rise in sea temperature may have an impact on commercial fish species' body sizes.""In the short term, the findings may mean a reduction in commercial fishery yields, impacting an industry worth around £1.4 billion to the UK economy and one that employs over twenty-four thousand people, according to records from the House of Commons research library.Idongesit Ikpewe said ""Our findings have crucial and immediate implications for the fisheries sector. The decrease in adult body size is likely to reduce commercial fisheries yields. However, in the long-term, the faster growing and larger juveniles may compensate, to some extent, for the latter yield loss, as although the increase in length (and, therefore, weight) per individual may be small, younger fish are far more numerous. It is this trade-off that we now need to investigate.""To mitigate global warming effects and maximise sustainable yields, the authors say that temperature changes should be factored into forecasts used in fishery management.The findings are also likely to impact marine ecosystems. ""Of the four species we looked at, three (cod, whiting and saithe) are fish eating predators towards the top end of the food chain and therefore have an important ecological role in the ecosystems they inhabit. Since predator size dictates what prey they can target, a change in the body size of these fish species may have implications or predator-prey relationships, with potential consequences on the structure of the food web."" said Idongesit Ikpewe.The maximum body size fish can reach is determined by the supply and demand of limiting resources like oxygen. Warmer water typically contains less oxygen but also increases metabolic rates and therefore demand for oxygen. Fish in warming waters may sooner reach the size where they can no longer acquire the oxygen needed for maintaining metabolic demands, thereby limiting adult body size.It's previously been shown in laboratory experiments that ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) develop faster at warmer temperatures but reach a smaller body size. This phenomenon, termed the 'temperature size rule', has been observed in several different animals, plants and bacteria. However, until now, few empirical studies have shown a link between increased temperature and faster growth in fish.In this study the researchers examined the body size of cod, haddock, whiting and saithe at different age groups and compared trends in juvenile length and adult length with annual bottom sea temperatures.They obtained the data from International Bottom Trawl Surveys provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. This provided 30 years of fishery-independent bottom trawl data from 1970 to 2017 for the North Sea and 1986 to 2016 for the West of Scotland.Although the findings provide strong empirical evidence for changes in fish size and growth rate in warming seas, the study was limited to demersal species (living close to the seabed) in areas around the UK. Other commercially important species to the UK such as mackerel and herring were not considered in this study.""The next stage of our work is to consider the management implications based on modelling these populations."" said Idongesit Ikpewe. ""The idea is to work out what the size changes we observed may mean for future fish productivity and yield under different scenarios of warming.""",Climate,2021.0,"A study from the University of Aberdeen has found that juvenile fish in the North Sea and West of Scotland are getting bigger while adult fish are getting smaller, with rising sea temperatures in both regions correlating with the changes in body size.

New research shows that a potentially toxic species of plankton algae that lives both by doing photosynthesis and absorbing food may become an important player in the Arctic Ocean as the future sea ice becomes thinner and thinner.","Microscopic plankton algae, invisible to the naked eye, are the foundation of the marine food web, feeding all the ocean´s living creatures from small crustaceans to large whales. Plankton algae need light and nutrients to produce food by photosynthesis.A thick layer of sea ice -- sometimes covered with snow -- can reduce how much sunlight penetrates into the water and stop the algae getting enough light. However, as the sea ice is becoming thinner and less widespread in the Arctic, more and more light is penetrating into the sea. Does this mean more plankton algae and thus more food for more fish, whales and seabirds in the Arctic? The story is not so simple.More light in the sea will only lead to a higher production of plankton algae if they also have enough nutrients -- and this is often not the case. With the recent increase in freshwater melt from Arctic glaciers and the general freshening of the Arctic Ocean, more and more fresh and nutrient-depleted water is running out into the fjords and further out into the sea. The fresher water lies on top of the more salty ocean and stops nutrients from the deeper layers from mixing up towards the surface where there is light. And it is only here that plankton algae can be active.However, a brand new study published today in the  journal Mixotrophic algae are small, single-celled plankton algae that can perform photosynthesis but also obtain energy by eating other algae and bacteria. This allows them to stay alive and grow even when their photosynthesis does not have enough light and nutrients in the water.In northeast Greenland, a team of researchers measured the production of plankton algae under the sea ice in the high-Arctic fjord Young Sound, located near Daneborg.""We showed that the plankton algae under the sea ice actually produced up to half of the total annual plankton production in the fjord,"" says Dorte H. Søgaard from the Greenland Climate Research Centre, Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and the Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, who headed the study.""Mixotrophic plankton algae have the advantage that they can sustain themselves by eating other algae and bacteria as a supplement to photosynthesis when there isn't enough light. This means that they are ready to perform photosynthesis even when very little light penetrates into the sea. In addition, many mixotrophic algae can live in relatively fresh water and at very low concentrations of nutrients -- conditions that often prevail in the water layers under the sea ice in the spring when the ice melts,"" Dorte H. Søgaard explains.For nine days, the researchers measured an algal bloom driven by mixotrophic algae occurring under the thick but melting sea ice in Young Sound during the Arctic spring in July, as the sun gained more power and more melt ponds spread across the sea ice, gradually letting through more light.The algae belong to a group called haptophytes. Many of these algae are toxic, and in this study they bloomed in quantities similar to those previously observed in the Skagerrak near southern Norway. Here, the toxic plankton algae killed large amounts of salmon in Norwegian fish farms.""We know that haptophytes often appear in areas with low salinity -- as seen in the Baltic Sea, for example. It is therefore very probable that these mixotrophic-driven algae blooms will appear more frequently in a more freshwater-influenced future Arctic Ocean and that this shift in dominant algae to a mixotrophic algae species might have a large ecological and socio-economic impact."" says Dorte H. Søgaard.The researchers behind the project point out that it is the first time that a bloom of mixotrophic algae has been recorded under the sea ice in the Arctic.",Climate,2021.0,"Plankton algae are the foundation of the marine food web, but a thick layer of sea ice can reduce how much sunlight penetrates into the water and stop the algae getting enough light.

154,2-Feb-21,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210202164530.htm,"Sea level will rise faster than previously thought, researchers show","There are two main elements to observe when assessing sea level rise. One is the loss of the ice on land, e.g., melting mountain glaciers and inland ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica, and the other is that the sea will expand as it gets warmer. The more its temperature increases, the faster the sea will rise. Researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen have constructed a new method of quantifying just how fast the sea will react to warming. The level of the sea is monitored meticulously, and we can compare the responsiveness in models with historical data. The comparison shows that former predictions of sea level have been too conservative, so the sea will likely rise more and faster than previously believed. The result is now published in the European Geosciences Union journal ","During the last 150 years, in what is called the industrial period, sea levels have been rising, as Aslak Grinsted, associate professor at the Niels Bohr Institute research section, Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth, explains. ""We expect, of course, that there is a connection between rising temperature and the rate indicating the momentum of the rise. Observations are telling us that the rate has been accelerating over the past 150 years. This means we can create a picture of how the connection between temperature and sea level rise has been, historically. But 150 years is not very long, actually, because of the great inertia in the warming of the oceans and inland ice sheets, so several hundreds of years can pass before we see the full consequences of warming in the atmosphere. This is why we compare the observations with the results from the detailed computer models we use to depict a future scenario. Among others, the climate panel of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has gathered these projections, made from a collection of many smaller models. These, in turn, have been validated, obviously, as well as can be done.""The predictions used by the IPCC are based on a jigsaw puzzle of models for ice sheets, glaciers and the warming of the sea. The predictions suffer, however, from the fact that only a limited amount of data are sometimes available for the models to be tested on. There was practically no data on the melt-off rate for Antarctica before we had coverage from satellite observations in the 1990s. ""We have better historical data for the sea level rise in total, which, in principle, allows for a test of the combined puzzle of models. However, it has not been part of the routine to make sea level hindcasts at IPCC, so presently we are not able to tell if these models are capable of reproducing the historical sea level. At the Niels Bohr Institute, we have used this situation as our starting point, and so we observe how sensitive the models are in reacting to warming. We expect that if we compare observational data from the fairly short period of time from 1850 onwards with the sensitivity of the models, it should allow us to assess whether the models are realistic or not,"" Aslak Grinsted explainsThe research team at the Niels Bohr Institute is hoping their method for validating future scenarios by looking into the past can gain a foothold in how sea level rise will be analysed in the future. ""Apparently, the models we are basing our predictions of sea level rise on presently are not sensitive enough. To put it plainly, they don't hit the mark when we compare them to the rate of sea level rise we see when comparing future scenarios with observations going back in time,"" Grinsted says.""It is crucial for our faith in model based climate predictions that they are able to reproduce the realized climate as realistically as possible,"" Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, Professor at the Ice, Climate and Geophysics Section at the Niels Bohr Institute and a co-author on the paper, adds. ""We hope this new comparison metric will be adopted to as large extent as is possible and can become a tool we can apply in comparing different models. A good example is that we don't expect the sensitivity to be the same all the way back to the last millennium or several millions of years back in time, but the added understanding of how the sensitivity might change over time is something we can add to the comparisons between models and observations. Besides, we'd like to see the method applied to the individual processes contributing to sea level rise. This might make the understanding of the sensitivity even more detailed, we believe.""""You could say,"" Aslak Grinsted ends the interview, "" that this article has two main messages: The scenarios we see before us now regarding sea level rise are too conservative -- the sea looks, using our method, to rise more than what is believed using the present method. The other message is that research in this area can benefit from using our method to constrain sea level models in the scenarios in the future.""",Climate,2021.0,"Sea levels have been rising for the past 150 years, and the rate of rising has been accelerating during this time, according to Aslak Grinsted, associate professor at the Niels Bohr Institute research section, Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth. However, current models used to predict future sea level rise may not be sensitive enough to accurately predict the rate of sea level rise. The research team at the Niels Bohr Institute has developed a new comparison metric to validate future scenarios by looking into the past, which they hope can become a tool to compare different models and improve our understanding of the sensitivity of different processes contributing to sea",,

But then came the novel coronavirus apparently has leapt from wildlife meat markets in China to the world in a matter of months. Global climate change creates conditions ripe for infernos in the North American west and Australia. Extreme Ohio flooding in 2018 gave way to sediments and excessive nutrients to dump into the Gulf of Mexico to the tune of some 300 square kilometers.In other words, all that's local is a lot more global, and the scientists in this week's ""Understanding and finding solutions to the recent and future crises need an integrated framework across local to global scales,"" said Jianguo ""Jack"" Liu, Michigan State University's (MSU) Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability.Liu has introduced the framework of metacoupling, which allows scientists to view the world as it truly is -- with humans and nature interacting over space and time and without boundaries of academic disciplines. The metacoupling framework lets scientists understand how actions locally, nearby and far away -- like policies that regulate the sale of wild animals or affect the release of greenhouse gasses -- result more in just cause and effect. Actions bounce back and forth between humans and nature from the community nearby and the country on the other side of the world. These are examples of feedback, and there are impacts that spill over in between. The paper notes that the metacoupling inserts the human element into the equation -- both where events happen, and where our impact is felt, and the spaces in between.In other words, for much of environmental sciences, Tobler's Law and its geography focus is going the way of tube tops and tie-dye in favor of what the authors say is ""a more comprehensive understanding of human-natural systems will emerge through this approach as a requisite for addressing today's large-scale ecological problems, and this will be part of the ""evolution"" of the new field of macrosystems biology.""Lead author Flavia Tromboni says the paper delivers a message that science indeed must evolve to capture the world as it is -- and where it is going. ""We cannot capture the magnitude of human impacts globally and be able to find solutions for pressing global environmental issues without considering all these multi-scale interactions,"" she said.

Urban areas produce almost 70 percent of those emissions, and city governments are proposing a variety of policy actions aimed at reducing them. Many cities also produce inventories that detail their greenhouse gas emissions.","Now, professor Kevin Gurney of Northern Arizona University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems and colleagues have compared the self-reported emissions inventories published by 48 major U.S. cities to estimates from a state-of-the-art emissions information system. As described in Gurney, who specializes in atmospheric science, ecology and climate policy, has spent the past two decades developing a standardized system for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions under his Vulcan and Hestia Projects. The system, funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), quantifies and visualizes greenhouse gases emitted across the entire country down to individual power plants, neighborhoods and roadways.The emissions estimates generated by the system help identify problem areas and enable better decisions about where to cut emissions most effectively. Two recent studies, at the nationwide level (link) and within the city of Indianapolis, IN (link), have shown that Gurney's estimates are consistent with estimates based on direct atmospheric monitoring, a key independent form of independent validation.Climate change policies in cities are rapidly progressing, and cities often rely on their self-reported inventories when developing their policies, Gurney compared 48 of these self-reported inventories from U.S. cities to emissions estimated by his Vulcan information system. The cities in the study included New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver and Philadelphia.""The results of this comparison were surprising,"" Gurney said. ""The differences were large and varied widely from one city to the next. When averaged, the self-reported emissions were almost 20 percent below the emissions estimated by the Vulcan system."" But that average doesn't tell the whole story: for example, Cleveland, Ohio reported emissions 90.1 percent below the Vulcan estimate while Palo Alto, Calif., reported emissions 41.7 percent greater than the Vulcan estimate.In order to prioritize and track emission reductions, cities will need an unbiased understanding of their emissions. ""The adage 'you can't manage what you can't measure' is really applicable here,"" Gurney said. ""Cities need a comprehensive and accurate assessment of their emissions. Without it, they could target the wrong emissions sources in their landscape for emission reduction or think they are on an emissions trajectory to meet their target, when in fact, they are not.""For example, the city of Indianapolis aims to make a 20 percent reduction in GHG emissions from buildings by 2025 relative to 2016 values. With the 26.9 percent underestimate found in the study, it will be difficult to track progress towards this target or know when and if it has been achieved.""Consistency in estimating emissions from one city to the next is also critical to comparing and contrasting different mitigation approaches and policies,"" said Gurney. ""This allows cities to borrow emission mitigation policies from others with similar emission characteristics. The inconsistencies in self-reported inventories make that very difficult.""The approach taken by the research team uses a consistent method across all cities in the U.S., combining federal, state, and local data systematically.""It is expensive and time-consuming for cities to build accurate urban greenhouse gas inventories,"" said Geoffrey Roest, an NAU postdoctoral researcher and co-author of the study. ""But we have emissions data for every city in the U.S., and we can collaborate with cities to help them produce comprehensive, accurate inventories from that data."" The research team found that the differences between the self-reported inventories and the Vulcan estimates were likely due to cities' not accounting for particular fuels or sectors where local information was limited or difficult to come by.""Vulcan data can be adapted to meet the needs of different cities by incorporating local data"" said Yang Song, an NAU postdoctoral researcher and co-author on the study. ""This will help cities identify the most effective strategies towards true and lasting emission reductions backed by the best science.""",Climate,2021.0,"A study by professor Kevin Gurney of Northern Arizona University has shown that self-reported emissions inventories published by 48 major US cities differ significantly from estimates generated by a state-of-the-art emissions information system.

People living at the time faced a series of challenges: changes in the climate, the opening up of trade and a degree of population growth. How did they respond to changes in their diet, especially in Western Switzerland? A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, and Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Spain has for the first time carried out isotopic analyses on human and animal skeletons together with plant remains. The scientists discovered that manure use had become widespread over time to improve crop harvests in response to demographic growth. The researchers also found that there had been a radical change in dietary habits following the introduction of new cereals, such as millet. In fact, the spread of millet reflected the need to embrace new crops following the drought that ravaged Europe during this period. Finally, the team showed that the resources consumed were mainly terrestrial. The research results are published in the journal ","Today, archaeological resources for studying the Bronze Age are limited. ""This is partly down to changes in funeral rituals,"" begins Mireille David-Elbiali, an archaeologist in the Laboratory of Prehistoric Archaeology and Anthropology in the F.-A. Forel Department in UNIGE's Faculty of Sciences. ""People gradually abandoned the inhumation practice in favour of cremation, thereby drastically reducing the bone material needed for research. And yet the Bronze Age signals the beginning of today's societies with the emergence of metallurgy."" As the name suggests, societies began working with bronze, an alloy consisting of copper and tin. ""And this development in metallurgy called for more intensive trade so they could obtain the essential raw materials. This increased the circulation of traditional crafts, prestigious goods, religious concepts and, of course, people between Europe and China,"" continues the archaeologist.The Neolithic Age marked the inception of animal husbandry and the cultivation of wheat and barley. But what about the diet in the next Bronze Age? Archaeobotany and archaeozoology have been routinely used to reconstruct the diet, environment, agricultural practices and animal husbandry in the Bronze Age, but these methods only provide general information. ""For the first time, we decided to answer this question precisely by analysing human and animal skeletons directly. This meant we could study the stable isotopes from the collagen of the bones and teeth that constitute them and define their living conditions,"" continues Alessandra Varalli, a researcher in UPF's Department of Human Sciences and the study's first author. ""In fact, we are what we eat,"" points out Marie Besse, a professor in the Laboratory of Prehistoric Archaeology and Anthropology in the F.-A. Forel Department at UNIGE. Biochemical analyses of bones and teeth will tell us what types of resources have been consumed."" Forty-one human skeletons, 22 animal skeletons and 30 plant samples from sites in Western Switzerland and Haute-Savoie (France) were studied, ranging from the beginning to the end of the Bronze Age.The study's first outcome showed that there was no difference between the diets of men and women, and that there were no drastic changes in diet between childhood and the adult phase of these individuals. ""So, there was no specific strategy for feeding children, just as men didn't eat more meat or dairy product than women. What's more, when it comes to the origin of the proteins consumed, it was found that although Western Switzerland is home to a lake and rivers, the diet was mainly based on terrestrial animals and plants to the exclusion of fish or other freshwater resources,"" adds Dr Varalli. But the main interest of the study lies in plants, which reveal societal upheavals.""During the early Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC), agriculture was mainly based on barley and wheat, two cereals of Near Eastern origin that were grown from the Neolithic Age in Europe,"" explains Dr Varalli. ""But from the late Late Bronze Age (1300 to 800 BC), we note that millet was introduced, a plant from Asia that grows in a more arid environmen."" In addition, nitrogen isotopes revealed that manuring was used more intensively. ""The analysis of several plant species from different phases of the Bronze Age suggests that there was an increase in soil fertilisation over time. This was most likely to boost the production of agricultural crops.""These two discoveries combined seem to confirm the general aridity that prevailed in Europe during this period, which meant agriculture had to be adapted; and that there was heightened trade between different cultures, such as Northern Italy or the Danube region, leading to the introduction of millet into Western Switzerland. These new cereals might have played an important role in the security of supply, and perhaps contributed to the population increase observed in the Late Bronze Age. In fact, these cereals grow more quickly and are more resistant to drought, at a time when the climate was relatively warm and dry. Finally, the use of fertiliser went hand-in-hand with a general improvement in techniques, both agricultural and artisanal. ""This first study on changes in diet in Western Switzerland during the Bronze Age corroborates what we know about the period. But it also demonstrates the richness of the widespread intercultural exchanges,"" states Professor Besse with enthusiasm. We still have much to learn about this millennium, in spite of the scientific problems related to the paucity of available material. ""This is one of the reasons that led me to excavate the Eremita cave with UNIGE students. Located in the Piedmont region of Italy, it is dated to the Middle Bronze Age around 1600 BC,"" concludes Professor Besse.",Climate,2021.0,"Archaeologists at the University of Geneva have used stable isotopes from human and animal bones and teeth to reveal changes in diet, agricultural practices and animal husbandry during the Bronze Age.

Their findings have been recently published in the scientific journal ""Inspired by the photosynthesis in nature, carbon dioxide can now be converted effectively into methane fuel by our newly designed solar-powered catalyst, which will lower carbon emission. Furthermore, this new catalyst is made from copper-based materials, which is abundant and hence affordable,"" said Dr Ng.He explained that it is thermodynamically challenging to convert carbon dioxide into methane using a photocatalyst because the chemical reduction process involves a simultaneous transfer of eight electrons. Carbon monoxide, which is harmful to human, is more commonly produced in the process because it requires the transfer of two electrons only.He pointed out that cuprous oxide (Cu2O), a semiconducting material, has been applied as both photocatalyst and electrocatalyst to reduce carbon dioxide into other chemical products like carbon monoxide and methane in different studies. However, it faces several limitations in the reduction process, including its inferior stability and the non-selective reduction which causes the formation of an array of various products. Separation and purification of these products from the mixture can be highly challenging and this imposes technological barrier for large scale application. Furthermore, cuprous oxide can be easily corroded after brief illumination and evolve into metallic copper or copper oxide.To overcome these challenges, Dr Ng and his team synthesised a novel photocatalyst by enwrapping cuprous oxide with copper-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Using this new catalyst, the team could manipulate the transfer of electrons and selectively produce pure methane gas.They discovered that when compared with cuprous oxide without MOF shell, cuprous oxide with MOF shell reduced carbon dioxide into methane stably under visible-light irradiation with an almost doubled yield. Also, cuprous oxide with MOF shell was more durable and the maximum carbon dioxide uptake was almost seven times of the bare cuprous oxide.The team encapsulated the one-dimensional (1-D) cuprous oxide nanowires (with a diameter of about 400nm) with the copper-based MOF outer shell of about 300nm in thickness. This conformal coating of MOF on cuprous oxide would not block light-harvesting of the catalyst. Besides, MOF is a good carbon dioxide adsorbent. It provided considerable surface areas for carbon dioxide adsorption and reduction. As it was closely attached to the cuprous oxide, it brought a higher concentration of carbon dioxide adsorbed at locations near the catalytic active sites, strengthening the interaction between carbon dioxide and the catalyst.Moreover, the team discovered that the cuprous oxide was stabilised by the conformal coating of MOF. The excited charges in cuprous oxide upon illumination could efficiently migrate to the MOF. In this way, excessive accumulation of excited charges within the catalyst which could lead to self-corrosion was avoided, hence extended the catalyst's lifetime.Previously, it was generally believed that the improved photocatalytic activities were merely induced by MOF's reactant concentration effect and MOF only served as a reactant adsorbent. However, Dr Ng's team unveiled how the excited charges migrate between cuprous oxide and MOF in this research. ""MOF is proven to play a more significant role in shaping the reaction mechanism as it changes the electron pathway,"" he said. He pointed out that this discovery has extended the understanding of relationships between MOFs and metal oxides beyond their conventional physical/chemical adsorption type of interactions to facilitating charge separation.The team has spent more than two years to develop this effective strategy in converting carbon dioxide. Their next step will be to further increase the methane production rate and explore ways to scale up both the synthesis of the catalyst and the reactor systems. ""In the entire process of converting carbon dioxide to methane, the only energy input we have used was sunlight. We hope in the future, carbon dioxide emitted from factories and transportation can be 'recycled' to produce green fuels,"" concluded Dr Ng.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers led by Dr Ng Yun-hau from the School of Energy and Environment have discovered a new catalyst that can convert carbon dioxide into methane fuel.

The answer to this question has important implications for how climate change might shift species' distributions across the globe.,"The study was published today in the journal Like lines of traffic traveling the same roads at the same time without crashing into each other, dwarf birch and gray willow dominate the Arctic landscape, covering and overlapping the same expansive territory, yet excluding each other in nearly indistinguishable microhabitats.The study suggests that climate and species interactions work together to promote the shrubs at large scales while also promoting their exclusion at small scales. In this case, herbivory by caribou and muskoxen tips the balance in favor of one species or another at small scales but favors their co-occurrence at large scales.This question of species diversity and co-occurrence versus exclusion has roots in a seminal paper in 1958 by Robert H. MacArthur that is taught in community ecology classes across the world. In that study, five species of warblers in the northeastern United States were observed avoiding each other while making their livings on different parts of the same tree -- some preferring upper or middle branches, others the ground or trunk, for example.""This is one of the most readily observable phenomena in nature,"" said lead author Eric Post, director of the UC Davis Polar Forum and a professor in the Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology. ""Yet what influences species co-variation at both scales is something ecologists have argued about for decades. Our study shows that the same factors can act at both large and small scales with opposite effects on co-occurrence and exclusion. It's fascinating.""For the study, the authors conducted the 15-year experiment at Post's long-time field site in Greenland. There, they recorded how arctic shrub abundance and composition changed in response to experimental warming treatments and to a treatment that fenced off large sections of tundra to exclude herbivores, such as caribou and muskoxen.The experiment confirmed what recent theoretical work has suggested: physical conditions, such as climate, combine with species interactions to shape opposing patterns of variation among arctic shrubs at large and local scales.The Arctic is becoming warmer and, in many places, drier. Those conditions favor willow over dwarf birch, the study found, even though birch are more abundant at the study site. While the absence of large herbivores favors almost complete exclusion of willow by birch, warming under those conditions swings the pendulum back slightly in favor of willow. Work in progress at the site also indicates changes in numbers of caribou and muskoxen, suggesting that muskoxen may be driving the balance between willows and birch under warming.How willow and birch react to such changes will affect how much carbon can be stored. The more shrubs in the Arctic, the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere. A diversity of species across the tundra provides a more efficient carbon sponge that just one dominant species of shrub.""Woody shrubs are expanding across many, but not all, regions of the treeless arctic tundra in what's referred to as 'arctic greening,'"" Post said. ""We're witnessing the transformation of a sensitive biome right beneath our feet.""This work suggests that large herbivores can interact with warming-driven shrub expansion in complex ways, potentially shaping the carbon landscape.The study's co-authors include Sean Cahoon of the USDA Forest Service in Alaska, Jeffrey Kerby of Aarhus University in Denmark, Christian Pedersen of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, and Patrick Sullivan of the University of Alaska in Anchorage.The study was funded by the National Geographic Society, NASA and the U.S. National Science Foundation.",Climate,2021.0,"Dwarf birch and gray willow dominate the Arctic landscape and overlap in the same territory, but exclude each other in microhabitats.

MIT geologists have now reconstructed a timeline of the Earth's temperature during the early Paleozoic era, between 510 and 440 million years ago -- a pivotal period when animals became abundant in a previously microbe-dominated world.","In a study appearing today in the The new record, more detailed than previous timelines of this period, is based on the team's analysis of carbonate muds -- a common type of limestone that forms from carbonate-rich sediments deposited on the seafloor and compacted over hundreds of millions of years.""Now that we have shown you can use these carbonate muds as climate records, that opens the door to looking back at this whole other part of Earth's history where there are no fossils, when people don't really know much about what the climate was,"" says lead author Sam Goldberg, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).Goldberg's co-authors are Kristin Bergmann, the D. Reid Weedon, Jr. Career Development Professor in EAPS, along with Theodore Present of Caltech and Seth Finnegan of the University of California at Berkeley.To estimate Earth's temperature many millions of years ago, scientists analyze fossils, in particular, remains of ancient shelled organisms that precipitated from seawater and either grew on or sank to the seafloor. When precipitation occurs, the temperature of the surrounding water can change the composition of the shells, altering the relative abundances of two isotopes of oxygen: oxygen-16, and oxygen-18.""As an example, if carbonate precipitates at 4 degrees Celsius, more oxygen-18 ends up in the mineral, from the same starting composition of water, [compared to] carbonate precipitating at 30 degrees Celsius,"" Bergmann explains. ""So, the ratio of oxygen-18 to -16 increases as temperature cools.""In this way, scientists have used ancient carbonate shells to backtrack the temperature of the surrounding seawater -- an indicator of the Earth's overall climate -- at the time the shells first precipitated. But this approach has taken scientists only so far, up until the earliest fossils.""There is about 4 billion years of Earth history where there were no shells, and so shells only give us the last chapter,"" Goldberg says.The same precipitating reaction in shells also occurs in carbonate mud. But geologists assumed the isotope balance in carbonate muds would be more vulnerable to chemical changes.""People have often overlooked mud. They thought that if you try to use it as a temperature indicator, you might be looking at not the original ocean temperature in which it formed, but the temperature of a process that occurred later on, when the mud was buried a mile below the surface,"" Goldberg says.To see whether carbonate muds might preserve signatures of their original surrounding temperature, the team used ""clumped isotope geochemistry,"" a technique used in Bergmann's lab, which analyzes sediments for clumping, or pairing, of two heavy isotopes: oxygen-18 and carbon-13. The likelihood of these isotopes pairing up in carbonate muds depends on temperature but is unaffected by the ocean chemistry in which the muds form.Combining this analysis with traditional oxygen isotope measurements provides additional constraints on the conditions experienced by a sample between its original formation and the present. The team reasoned that this analysis could be a good indication of whether carbonate muds remained unchanged in composition since their formation. By extension, this could mean the oxygen-18 to -16 ratio in some muds accurately represents the original temperature at which the rocks formed, enabling their use as a climate record.The researchers tested their idea on samples of carbonate muds that they extracted from two sites, one in Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, and the other in western Newfoundland. Both sites are known for their exposed rocks that date back to the early Paleozoic era.In 2016 and 2017, teams traveled first to Svalbard, then Newfoundland, to collect samples of carbonate muds from layers of deposited sediment spanning a period of 70 million years, from the mid-Cambrian, when animals began to flourish on Earth, through the Ordovician periods of the Paleozoic era.When they analyzed the samples for clumped isotopes, they found that many of the rocks had experienced little chemical change since their formation. They used this result to compile the rocks' oxygen isotope ratios from 10 different early Paleozoic sites to calculate the temperatures at which the rocks formed. The temperatures calculated from most of these sites were similar to previously published lower-resolution fossil temperature records. In the end, they mapped a timeline of temperature during the early Paleozoic and compared this with the fossil record from that period, to show that temperature had a big effect on the diversity of life on the planet.""We found that when it was warmer at the end of the Cambrian and early Ordovician, there was also a peak in microbial abundance,"" Goldberg says. ""From there it cooled off going into the middle to late Ordovician, when we see abundant animal fossils, before a substantial ice age ends the Ordovician. Previously people could only observe general trends using fossils. Because we used a material that's very abundant, we could create a higher-resolution record and could see more clearly defined ups and downs.""The team is now looking to analyze older muds, dating back before the appearance of animals, to gauge the Earth's temperature changes prior to 540 million years ago.""To go back beyond 540 million years ago, we have to grapple with carbonate muds, because they are really one of the few records we have to constrain climate in the distant past,"" Bergmann says.This research was supported, in part, by NASA and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.",Climate,2021.0,"MIT researchers have created a timeline of Earth's temperatures using carbonate muds, a common type of limestone that forms from carbonate-rich sediments deposited on the seafloor and compacted over hundreds of millions of years.

""Breeding for this trait should be helpful in developing new crops for climate mitigation.""Called multiseriate cortical sclerenchyma by the researchers -- or MCS -- the phenotype is characterized by small cells with thick walls just beneath the surface of the roots. Roots with the MCS genotype have a greater concentration of lignin -- a complex organic polymer that is important in the formation of cell walls, especially in wood and bark, that lends rigidity.More lignin gives the MCS roots greater tensile strength and greater root tip bending force compared to non-MCS genotypes. This added rigidity helps roots penetrate hard soil layers.The findings of the root anatomy study, published today (Feb. 1) in Soil compaction reduces porosity, limits water infiltration, reduces aeration and restricts root growth by presenting a physical impediment, noted lead researcher Hannah Schneider, postdoctoral scholar in Lynch's research group in the College of Agricultural Sciences.""Compacted soil layers constrain crop productivity by restricting root growth and exploration in deeper soil layers, which in turn limits access to nutrients and water,"" she said. ""Plants with roots that are able to penetrate hard soil and forage deeper have an advantage in capturing water and nutrients -- ultimately performing better in drought or low soil fertility.""The study included both field and greenhouse components to assess root-penetration ability in compacted soils.Scientists conducted two field experiments to study root growth -- one at the Apache Root Biology Center in Willcox, Arizona, and the other at Penn State's Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center at Rock Springs. At each location, researchers grew six corn genotypes contrasting in root lignin content. Each field experiment involved compaction and noncompaction treatments.When the corn flowered, soils were cored near randomly selected plants to assess root growth. The roots of two plants per research plot also were dug up and evaluated, and shoot biomass was collected.Twelve wheat genotypes and six corn genotypes also were grown in a greenhouse at the University Park campus. Large growth containers, or ""mesocosms,"" were set up with a compacted soil layer to determine which roots penetrated the hard substrate. After more than a month's growth, root segments from each of the corn and wheat genotypes were collected, measured and tested for tensile strength and root tip bending force.This research utilized laser ablation tomography -- known as LAT -- to visualize the anatomy of roots from plants in the study. Lynch's research group developed the unique technology in 2011 for other root-analysis applications. Researchers using LAT can measure the light spectra given off by different cells cut by the laser to differentiate between various tissues.Genetic variation for MCS was found in each of the cereals examined by the researchers, and heritability was relatively high, they reported, suggesting that this trait can be selected in breeding programs. Of the plant lines reviewed in this study, MCS was present in 30 to 50% of modern corn, wheat and barley cultivars.The implications of corn crops growing deeper roots to range farther for water and nutrients -- and as a consequence producing larger yields -- would be immense in regions where the populace is food-insecure, Schneider pointed out. That is especially true in the face of a changing climate that is making vast areas more drought-prone.""We observe MCS in corn, wheat, barley and many other cereal crops, and our work suggests that many of the benefits of MCS may be analogous across different species,"" she said. ""MCS could be an important trait for stress tolerance and increased yields in cereal crops.""",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have discovered a genetic trait in corn, wheat and barley that could help crops grow deeper roots, making them more drought-resistant, nitrogen-efficient and capable of carbon sequestration.

""Although winter mortality is known to vary regionally, the landscape and weather factors underlying this variation are poorly understood.""Honey bee colonies are not dormant during the winter, Calovi pointed out. The bees remain active and maintain the hive temperature between 75 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit by forming a thermoregulating cluster, in which they organize into a tight ball and vibrate their flight muscles to generate heat, allowing the colony to survive when outside temperatures fall below 50 F. This enables them to survive long periods of cold temperatures.""During the winter, the colony stops foraging for nectar and pollen and relies on its existing food stores, collected during the plant growing season,"" she said. ""Rearing of new bees also ceases, and the colony depends on the survival of a long-lived cohort of bees that is produced in the autumn.""As a result, any factors that limit the colony's ability to store adequate amounts of food during the summer and fall, that undermine effective thermoregulation during the winter, or that reduce the life span of overwintering bees can contribute to colony mortality, said co-author Christina Grozinger, Publius Vergilius Maro Professor of Entomology in the College of Agricultural Sciences.Among these factors, she said, are weather conditions that influence the availability of forage, the bees' ability to thermoregulate in the winter, and the amount of time before bees are able to initiate brood rearing in the spring. Other dynamics include beekeeper management practices that affect parasite and pathogen loads -- particularly control of Varroa mites that transmit viruses -- and forage quality and pesticide exposure due to the surrounding land use.""We need to consider all of these factors when modeling and predicting honey bee winter survival,"" Grozinger said, ""and that requires large data sets that span multiple types of habitats, microclimates and years.""To collect beekeeper management and winter survival data, the researchers collaborated with the Pennsylvania State Beekeepers Association, which conducts an annual winter-loss survey of beekeepers across the state. The association provided data from this survey covering three winters and containing information about 1,429 honey bee colonies within 257 apiaries.For each reported apiary location, the researchers compiled data on weather and topographic variables that determine temperature and moisture conditions, as well as landscape variables that influence the availability of floral resources and insecticide exposure risk. The team included agronomic measures such as consecutive dry days and growing degree days, which is a measure of heat accumulation used to estimate growth and development of plants and insects during the growing season.These diverse and complex datasets were integrated and analyzed using Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm that merges the output of multiple variables to reach a single result.As the research team reported recently in For these beekeepers, the four most important variables in predicting winter colony survival were growing degree days, maximum temperature of the warmest quarter, precipitation during the warmest quarter and precipitation during the wettest quarter. Of these, the strongest predictor was growing degree days in the prior summer, which researchers said may relate to floral resource availability.""The importance of weather conditions in predicting winter bee survival is quite clear from our analysis,"" said co-author Sarah Goslee, ecologist with the Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.""Our nuanced analysis of 36 weather and other environmental variables found adverse effects of both too-cool and too-hot summers,"" she said.

Extreme snowfall one year, for example, might increase the amount of ice in Antarctica. Changes in the atmosphere or surrounding ocean might decrease it another year.Overall, Wang said, the volume of ice in Antarctica is decreasing. But a chart of the decline on a line graph would have spikes and valleys depending on what happened in a given time period.To understand those changes, Wang and the other researchers evaluated data on the gravitational field between the satellites over Antarctica and ice on the continent. Changes to the ice's mass -- either increases from big snowfalls or decreases from melt -- change that gravitational field.From 2016 to 2018, for example, the ice sheet in West Antarctica actually grew a bit because of a massive snow. During that same time period, though, the ice sheet in East Antarctica shrank because of melt.""I'm not saying Antarctica's ice melt is not an acute problem -- it is still very acute,"" Wang said.

The results of the extensive research project were recently published in the The researchers discovered that atmospheric vapors, particles, and cloud formation have clear differences within various Arctic environments. The study clarifies how Arctic warming and sea ice loss strengthens processes where different vapors are emitted to the atmosphere. The thinning of sea ice enables more iodine emissions while broader open waters enable more emissions of sulfur-containing vapors.Higher concentrations of vapors result in a higher amount of particles.

Detailed knowledge of these processes is crucial in order to understand the consequences of global warming.""Our observations are contributing to further understanding of what happens in the Arctic atmosphere due to warming. In general, atmospheric particles and clouds play an important role in regulating the atmosphere's temperature, and any changing behavior of these has consequences on Arctic warming.

While both sites are located at similar latitudes, about 1000 km south of the North Pole, their environments are very different. Villum-station is surrounded by sea ice all year round, while the warm sea currents cause the sea around Ny-Ålesund to remain open.In Northern Greenland the researchers discovered that in the spring after the Polar night the microalgae below the sea ice started to emit iodine compounds to the atmosphere. As the spring continues, the thinning sea ice leads to the emission of even more iodine compounds. These compounds form molecular clusters that can grow into bigger particles.In Svalbard, surrounded by open waters, the observations showed how sulfur-compounds emitted by phytoplankton could form a large amount of particles that could grow fast, and can even form cloud droplets.

Prehistoric engravings of giraffes and crocodiles testify to this, as does a stone-age cave painting in the desert that even shows swimming humans. However, these illustrations only provide a rough picture of the living conditions. Recently, more detailed insights have been gained from sediment cores extracted from the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya. An international research team examined these cores and discovered that the layers of the seafloor tell the story of major environmental changes in North Africa over the past 160,000 years. Cécile Blanchet of the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ and her colleagues from Germany, South Korea, the Netherlands and the USA report on this in the journal ","Together with the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, a team of scientists organized a research cruise on the Dutch vessel Pelagia to the Gulf of Sirte in December 2011. ""We suspected that when the Sahara Desert was green, the rivers that are presently dry would have been active and would have brought particles into the Gulf of Sirte,"" says lead author Cécile Blanchet. Such sediments would help to better understand the timing and circumstances for the reactivation of these rivers.Using a method called ""piston coring,"" the scientists were able to recover 10-meters long columns of marine mud. ""One can imagine a giant hollow cylinder being pushed into the seafloor,"" says co-author Anne Osborne from GEOMAR, who was onboard the research ship. ""The marine mud layers contain rock fragments and plant remains transported from the nearby African continent. They are also full of shells of microorganisms that grew in seawater.

The team's unprecedented reconstruction continuously covers the last 160,000 years. It offers a comprehensive picture of when and why there was sufficient rainfall in the Central Sahara to reactivate these rivers. ""We found that it is the slight changes in the Earth's orbit and the waxing and waning of polar ice sheets that paced the alternation of humid phases with high precipitation and long periods of almost complete aridity,"" explains Blanchet.The fertile periods generally lasted five thousand years and humidity spread over North Africa up to the Mediterranean coast. For the people of that time, this resulted in drastic changes in living conditions, which probably led to large migratory movements in North Africa. ""With our work we have added some essential jigsaw pieces to the picture of past Saharan landscape changes that help to better understand human evolution and migration history,"" says Blanchet.

The research is published today in Globally, 80 to 100 cyclones develop over tropical oceans each year, impacting regions in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans and causing billions of dollars of damage.Lead author Dr Shuai Wang, from the Department of Physics at Imperial, said: ""Tropical cyclones are some of the most devastating natural hazards in terms of how destructive and frequent they are in coastal regions.""Our study shows they are likely becoming more destructive as they spend more time along coastlines at their highest intensities. The risk to some coastal communities around the world may be increasing and that will have profound implications over the coming decades.""The team analysed global data from 1982-2018 on tropical cyclone formation, movement and intensity mainly gathered from satellite observations. They found that at maximum intensity, cyclones were on average getting 30km closer to coastlines per decade. There were also on average two more cyclones per decade within 200km of land.These increases did not necessarily mean more cyclones made landfall (reached land). However, the 'near-misses' or 'indirect-hit' cyclones near coasts can still cause damage, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Dorian in 2019, both of which skirted along the US coast for a considerable time before making landfall.The paper's other author, Professor Ralf Toumi from the Department of Physics and Co-Director of the Grantham Institute -- Climate Change and Environment at Imperial, said: ""We need to understand all aspects of tropical cyclones and this new study shows how their locations are changing. This often gets less attention than changes in their intensity but is at least as important.""Previously, studies have shown that the maximum intensity of tropical cyclones is found further towards the poles. However, this does not necessarily mean these more poleward storms are more devastating. The new findings show cyclones at maximum intensity are also migrating westward, bringing them closer to coastlines and increasing their potential for damage.The westward migration appears to be driven by anomalous 'steering' -- the underlying flow in the atmosphere that carries cyclones along their tracks. The exact mechanism for this enhanced westward steering is unknown, but it may be due to the same underlying mechanism for poleward migration of cyclones as rising temperatures cause atmospheric patterns to shift.The team will next use climate simulations to determine the underlying mechanism behind these historical shifts and project potential future shifts in tropical cyclone tracks towards global coastal regions.",Climate,2021.0,"Tropical cyclones, such as hurricanes and typhoons, are increasingly moving towards coasts due to a westward shift in their tracks, according to a study by Imperial College London.

This was a huge international effort that includes over 90 authors from 60 institutions in 20 countries.The data can be used by scientists and conservationists to better understand the environmental cues that influence when coral species spawn, such as temperature, daylight patterns and the lunar cycle.By providing access to data going back as far as 1978, it can also help researchers identify any long-term trends in the timing of spawning and provide additional evidence for differentiating very closely related coral species.It will also provide an important baseline against which to evaluate future changes in regional and global patterns of spawning times or seasonality associated with climate change.Most corals reproduce by expelling eggs and sperm into open water during short night-time spawning events. These events can be highly synchronised within and among species, with millions of colonies spawning at much the same time resulting in one of nature's most spectacular displays.The discovery of multi-species synchronous spawning of scleractinian, or hard, corals on the Great Barrier Reef in the 1980s stimulated an extraordinary effort to document spawning times in other parts of the globe. However, much of the data remained unpublished until now, meaning that there was little information about the month, date, and time of spawning or geographical variation in these factors.The new, open access database collates much of the disparate data into one place. The CSD includes over 6,000 observations of the time or day of spawning for more than 300 scleractinian species from 101 sites in tropical regions across the Indian and western Pacific oceans.Dr James Guest, from the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University, said: ""Coral spawning times can be used to address many significant and fundamental questions in coral reef ecology. Knowing when corals spawn can assist coastal management -- for example, if dredging operations cease during mass spawning events. It also has enormous potential for scientific outreach, education and tourism if spawning events can be witnessed in person or remotely.""Professor Andrew Baird from the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reefs Studies at James Cook University added: ""The CSD is a dynamic database that will grow over time as new observations become available. Anyone can add data at any time by contacting us and we will update the online database annually.""Our vision is to help advance many aspects of coral reef science and conservation at a time of unprecedented environmental and societal change.

Their reproductive strategy is like investing in a mutual fund. Females divide their resources among many stocks rather than investing everything in a single stock,"" said Deby Cassill, biology professor at USF's St. Petersburg campus and author of the study.During their 50-year lifetime, a single female loggerhead will produce around 4,200 eggs and scatter them at 40 different sites on the barrier island. This strategy helps reduce the risk of complete reproductive failure by hurricanes and thunderstorms that could wash out or flood all clutches.""Because females diversify reproduction in unpredictable patterns over time and space, nearly two-thirds of loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings made it into the Gulf of Mexico,"" said Cassill.For the study, Cassill analyzed 17 years of data provided by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida on loggerhead females nesting on Keewaydin Island off the southwestern Gulf coast of Florida. For years, conservancy staff and community volunteers tagged turtles and patrolled the island to monitor and record detailed information on the nesting population.Though the study shows most sea turtle hatchlings reach the Gulf of Mexico, future impacts due to human encroachment and climate change could affect the population. Increased frequency of extreme storms due to warmer waters and sea-level rise may flood or wash away larger portions of clutches, leading to population declines of the threatened species.""It's important to follow individuals over time to really get a glimpse of how they mate, find food and ensure that some of their young survive to maturity.

Mammal mothers like whales and elephants provide extensive care to one offspring at a time when the likelihood their young will starve during seasonal droughts is high.The model, based on the number and size of offspring produced by a mother, extends Darwin's theory of natural selection by explaining the fusion of parents and offspring into family units and societies.",Climate,2021.0,"Female loggerhead sea turtles scatter their eggs at 40 different sites on a barrier island to reduce the risk of complete reproductive failure caused by hurricanes and thunderstorms, according to a study by the University of South Florida.

But new research by Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geosciences with the Virginia Tech College of Science, and Tian Gan, a visiting Ph.D. student in the Xiao lab, highlights yet another important role that fungi have played throughout the Earth's history: helping the planet recover from an ice age.","A team of scientists from Virginia Tech, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guizhou Education University, and University of Cincinnati has discovered the remains of a fungi-like microfossil that emerged at the end of an ice age some 635 million years ago. It is the oldest terrestrial fossil ever found. To put it into perspective, this microfossil predates the oldest dinosaurs about three times over.Their findings were published in The fossil was found in small cavities within well-studied sedimentary dolostone rocks of the lowermost Doushantuo Formation in South China. Although the Doushantuo Formation has provided a plethora of fossils to date, researchers did not expect to find any fossils toward the lower base of the dolostones.But against all odds, Gan found a few long, thread-like filaments -- one of the key characteristics of fungi.""It was an accidental discovery,"" said Gan. ""At that moment, we realized that this could be the fossil that scientists have been looking for a long time. If our interpretation is correct, it will be helpful for understanding the paleoclimate change and early life evolution.""This discovery is key for understanding multiple turning points throughout Earth's history: the Ediacaran period and the terrestrialization of fungi.When the Ediacaran period began, the planet was recovering from a catastrophic ice age, also known as the ""snowball Earth."" At that time, ocean surfaces were frozen to a depth of more than a kilometer and it was an incredibly harsh environment for virtually any living organism, except for some microscopic life that managed to thrive. Scientists have long wondered how life ever returned to normalcy -- and how the biosphere was able to grow larger and more complex than ever before.With this new fossil in hand, Tian and Xiao are certain that these microscopic, low profile cave dwellers played numerous roles in the reconditioning of the terrestrial environment in the Ediacaran time. One role involved their formidable digestive system.Fungi have a rather unique digestive system that plays an even greater role in the cycling of vital nutrients. Using enzymes secreted into the environment, terrestrial fungi can chemically break down rocks and other tough organic matter, which can then be recycled and exported into the ocean.""Fungi have a mutualistic relationship with the roots of plants, which helps them mobilize minerals, such as phosphorus. Because of their connection to terrestrial plants and important nutritional cycles, terrestrial fungi have a driving influence on biochemical weathering, the global biogeochemical cycle, and ecological interactions,"" said Gan.Although previous evidence stated that terrestrial plants and fungi formed a symbiotic relationship around 400 million years ago, this new discovery has recalibrated the timeline of when these two kingdoms colonized the land.""The question used to be: 'Were there fungi in the terrestrial realm before the rise of terrestrial plants',"" said Xiao, an affiliated faculty member of the Fralin Life Sciences Institute and the Global Change Center. ""And I think our study suggests yes. Our fungus-like fossil is 240 million years older than the previous record. This is, thus far, the oldest record of terrestrial fungi.""Now, new questions have arisen. Since the fossilized filaments were accompanied by other fossils, Gan will set out to explore their past relationships.""One of my goals is to constrain the phylogenetic affinities of these other types of fossils that are associated with the fungal fossils,"" said Gan.Xiao is thrilled to tackle the environmental aspects of these microorganism. Sixty years ago, few believed that microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, could be preserved as fossils. Now that Xiao has seen them with his very eyes, he plans to learn more about how they have been virtually frozen in time.""It is always important to understand the organisms in the environmental context,"" said Xiao. ""We have a general idea that they lived in small cavities in dolostone rocks. But little is known about how exactly they lived and how they were preserved. Why can something like fungi, which have no bones or shells, be preserved in the fossil record?""However, it can't be said for sure if this fossil is a definitive fungus. Although there is a fair amount of evidence behind it, the investigation into these microfossils is ongoing.""We would like to leave things open for other possibilities, as a part of our scientific inquiry,"" said Xiao. ""The best way to put it is that perhaps we have not disapproved that they are fungi, but they are the best interpretation that we have at the moment.""Three distinct groups and labs at Virginia Tech were crucial for the identification and timestamping of this fossil. The Confocal Laser Scanning and Microscopy lab at the Fralin Life Sciences Institute helped Tian and Xiao perform initial analysis that prompted further investigation at the University of Cincinnati.The Department of Biological Sciences' Massey Herbarium, which houses over 115,000 specimens of vascular plants, fungi, bryophytes, and lichens, provided modern fungal specimens for comparison with the fossils.The team called in technicians to conduct geochemical analysis using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, which ionize nanomoles of material from small areas that are a fraction the thickness of a hair strand, to analyze the isotopic abundance of sulfur-32 and sulfur-34 in order to understand the fossilization environment.Advanced computerized tomography was crucial to getting the 3D morphology of the filaments, which are just a few micrometers thick. And a combination of Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy allowed researchers to cut samples with surgical precision and take an even closer look at every nanometer of the filaments.""This wasn't a single person or even a single lab that did this work,"" said Xiao.Xiao also emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary research in this study and many others.""It's very important to encourage the next generation of scientists to be trained in an interdisciplinary light because new discoveries always happen at the interface of different fields,"" said Xiao.",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists from Virginia Tech, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guizhou Education University, and University of Cincinnati have discovered the remains of a fungi-like microfossil that emerged at the end of an ice age some 635 million years ago.

But new findings, published today in the journal Scientists from a UK-China partnership, including the University of Exeter, used an innovative climate model to simulate vegetation and plant diversity, combined with spectacular new fossil finds, to discover how this unique biodiversity hotspot evolved.Lead author, Dr Shufeng Li, a visiting scientist at the University of Bristol in the UK and associate professor at Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) Institute in Yunnan, China, said: ""Until now it was unknown why the climate changed from that of a dry, arid, almost desert-like ecosystem to that of a lush, wet ecosystem where a vast array of plant, animal, and marine life can be found, including some of the world's rarest species.""We conducted 18 sensitivity experiments using different Tibetan topographies representing various late Paleogene to early Neogene conditions, which test almost all possible Tibetan growth evolution scenarios.""The findings showed that from the late Paleogene to the early Neogene age, some 23-40 million years ago, the growth of the north and northeastern portion of Tibet was the most important factor because it increased rainfall, especially winter rainfall, over eastern Asia where dry winter conditions existed before.This allowed the development of a stable, wet and warm climate, conducive to the evolution of vast and varied plants and animal species which formed the biodiversity hotspot known today for supplying more than a billion people with fresh water and providing ingredients used for lifesaving pharmaceutical drugs. Rare species of monkey, tiger, leopard, bear, fox, mongoose, hedgehog, seal, dolphin, and sea lion all live in this abundant ecosystem.Earlier research has mainly investigated the impact of Tibetan mountain building much further to the South when India collided with Asia around 55 million years ago, leading to the rise of the Himalaya mountains and, eventually, the vast arid Tibetan Plateau. However, recent work is increasingly showing the creation of the modern Tibetan plateau was complex, and did not rise as one monolithic block as originally believed.Dr Taraka Davies-Barnard, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Physicals Sciences at the University of Exeter said: ""This collaboration between scientists from across the world has revealed how subtle interactions of climate and environment shaped an area of exceptional biodiversity. We need to cooperate similarly to safeguard this ecosystem for future generations.""Co-author Professor Paul Valdes, Professor of Physical Geography at the University of Bristol who led the modelling group, said: ""Most previous studies have focused on Southern Tibet and the Himalaya, but our results indicate it is the growth of northern Tibet which is really important.""The topography of northern Tibet decreases the East Asian winter monsoon winds in the southern part of China, causing wetter winters in eastern Asia and this allows the expansion of vegetation and biodiversity.""So enigmatic was the drastic change that even in Chinese folklore this area is known as the 'Land of Fish and Rice', due to its immense productivity.""Without the growth in Northern Tibetan mountains, none of this would exist. But our research should also be taken as a cautionary tale,"" Professor Valdes explained.""A unique set of tectonic and stable climatic conditions over millions of years allowed the development of this rare species rich region of South East Asia. However, global warming, harmful intensive agricultural techniques, forest clearing and lack of integrated conservation to preserve this unique ecosystem means once it is gone, it is gone for good.""Professor Zhekun Zhou, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' XTBG, who led on the fossil analysis, said: ""So effectively, without northern Tibetan growth, there would be no 'land of milk and honey' in eastern Asia. This research represents a significant breakthrough in understanding how this remarkably rich region of mountainous terrain and diverse plant life formed.""",Climate,2021.0,"New research published in the journal Science has shown that the growth of the north and northeastern portion of Tibet was the most important factor in the creation of the biodiversity hotspot that is now home to some of the world's rarest species, including monkeys, tigers, bears, hedgehogs and dolphins.

""We looked into the processes responsible for higher or lower emissions and paid particularly close attention to trends in net COThe researchers learned that poorer countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa experienced the most pronounced surge in these ""land-use change"" emissions.East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East produced fewer greenhouse gases as a result of land-use change, according to the study, but the regions' agricultural emissions were growing strongly as output raced to keep up with population expansion. And more affluent North America, Europe and Oceania showed negative land-use change emissions but nonetheless substantial farm-originated pollution.""While the situation in low-income countries is critical, mitigation opportunities in these places are large and clear,"" said senior author Steve Davis, UCI associate professor of Earth system science. ""Improving yields on already cultivated land can avoid clearing more carbon-dense forests for cultivation of soybeans, rice, maize and palm oil, thereby drastically reducing land-use emissions in these countries.""The authors suggest that nations in emerging and developed markets also can lessen the emissions intensity of agriculture by adopting more efficient tilling and harvesting methods, by better soil and livestock waste management, and by reducing food waste.In addition, dietary changes could help, according to the study, which says that while red meat supplies only about 1 percent of calories produced globally, it's responsible for up to a quarter of the world's land-use greenhouse gas emissions.Europe has the lowest land-use emissions, at 0.5 tons per person per year, the researchers note, but the figure is substantially higher almost everywhere else, and as the planet's population continues to increase, farmers and policymakers will need to meet and exceed current best practices.The paper highlights some promising technological solutions, such as new ways of cultivating rice that create less methane and dietary supplements for cattle that reduce their harmful emissions by up to 95 percent.""Feeding the planet may always generate substantial greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Davis, a member of the executive board of UCI's Solutions that Scale initiative which seeks answers to the planet's most pressing climate and environmental problems. ""Even if we get emissions down to European levels worldwide, with expected population growth, we could still be looking at more than 5 gigatons of land-use emissions per year in 2100, an amount at odds with ambitious international climate goals unless offset by negative emissions.""The project -- funded by the National Science Foundation, the German Research Foundation, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation -- also included researchers from the University of California, San Diego; Colorado State University; Stanford University; and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study published in Nature Communications has found that poorer countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have experienced the most significant surge in ""land-use change"" emissions.

She and her colleagues tested the hypothesis that these ancient communities displayed coordinated stasis -- a theory that attempts to explain the emergence and disappearance of species across geologic time.Newton and Brower, along with their student Willis Newman G'93, found that Devonian marine communities vary more in species composition than the theory predicts. Newton points out that they sought not to disprove coordinated stasis but rather to gain a more sophisticated understanding of when it is applicable. ""Discovering more about the dynamics of these apparently stable Devonian communities is critical,"" she says. ""Such knowledge has immediate significance for marine community changes in our rapidly warming seas.""Since geologist James Hall Jr. first published a series of volumes on the region's Devonian fossils and strata in the 1840s, the Hamilton Group has become a magnet for research scientists and amateur collectors alike. Today, Central New York is frequently used to test new ideas about large-scale changes in Earth's organisms and environments.During Middle Devonian time (approximately 380-390 million years ago), the faunal composition of the region changed little over 4-6 million years. ""It's a significant amount for marine invertebrate communities to remain stable, or 'locked,'"" explains Newton, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences.She, Brower and student researchers spent years examining eight communities of animals that once dwelled in a warm, shallow sea on the northern rim of the Appalachian Basin (which, eons ago, lay south of the equator). When the organisms died, sediment from the seafloor began covering their shells and exoskeletons. Minerals from the sediment gradually seeped into their remains, causing them to fossilize. The process also preserved many of them in living position, conserving original shell materials at some sites.These fossils currently populate exposed bedrock throughout Central New York, ranging from soft, dark, deep-water shale to hard, species-rich, shelf siltstone. ""Communities near the top of the bedrock exhibit more taxonomic and ecological diversity than those at the bottom,"" Newton says. ""We can compare the community types and composition through time. They are remarkable sites.""Coordinated stasis has been a source of contention since 1995, when it was introduced. At the center of the dispute are two model-based explanations: environmental tracking and ecological locking.Environmental tracking suggests that faunas follow their environment. ""Here, periods of relative stasis are flanked by coordinated extinctions or regional disappearances. When the environment changes, so do marine faunas,"" says Newton, also Professor of Interdisciplinary Sciences and Dean Emerita of Arts and Sciences.Ecological locking, in contrast, views marine faunas as tightly structured communities, resistant to large-scale taxonomic change. Traditionally, this model has been used to describe the stability of lower Hamilton faunas.Newton and her colleagues analyzed more than 80 sample sites, each containing some 300 specimens. Special emphasis was placed on the Cardiff and Pecksport Members, two rock formations in the Finger Lakes region that are part of the ancient Marcellus subgroup, famed for its natural gas reserves.""We found that lower Hamilton faunas, with two exceptions, do not have clear counterparts among upper ones. Therefore, our quantitative tests do not support the ecological locking model as an explanation for community stability in these faunas,"" she continues.Newton considers this project a final tribute to Newman, a professor of biology at the State University of New York at Cortland, who died in 2014, and Brower, who fell seriously ill while the manuscript was being finalized. ""Jim knew that he likely would not live to see its publication,"" says Newton, adding that Brower died as the paper was submitted to GSA.She says this new work extends and, in some ways, completes the team's earlier research by further analyzing community structures in the Marcellus subgroup. ""It has the potential to change how scientists view long-term stability in ecological communities.""",Climate,2021.0,"A team of paleontologists led by Professor Cathryn Newton has conducted 15 years of quantitative analysis on the fossils of Devonian marine faunas, which are lodged in a unit of bedrock in Central New York known as the Hamilton Group.

Optimizing switchgrass to grow efficiently in many diverse environments is a key component of ensuring its success as a biofuel feedstock.The findings are published today in the journal This quest for better switchgrass began more than a decade ago in the UT Austin lab of Tom Juenger, a professor of integrative biology and a corresponding author of the paper. In requesting samples from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's switchgrass stocks, he noticed a lack of diversity. So, he and his then-postdoctoral researcher, David Lowry, set out to find their own.""Originally, a lot of these collections came from us driving around in a pickup truck with a shovel and digging up plants off the side of the road or in parks where we had permits,"" said Lowry, a co-author of the paper, who is now an assistant professor of plant biology at Michigan State University.Switchgrass is a hardy perennial with deep roots that grows all over the country from Canada to Mexico and is an important component of the tallgrass prairie habitats of central North America. It can reach heights of 12 feet in some areas and is used to control erosion, as a game cover and occasionally as food for cattle.But its most important use may come as a source of biofuel, which is a critical component of lowering atmospheric carbon levels and combatting climate change. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop high-yielding varieties of switchgrass matched to one or more of the many different climates and eco-regions of the United States.Juenger, Lowry and colleagues from HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and the DOE Joint Genome Institute created 10 identical gardens in eight states, growing clones of more than 1,000 switchgrass samples collected from across North America. They sequenced the genetic diversity of these samples and assembled a high-quality reference genome sequence to compare the diversity. They then chronicled which varieties thrived and where, matching sections of their genomes with specific traits that had evolved over millennia to specific climates throughout the continent.""We ended up finding three very distinct populations of switchgrass from three regions of the United States, all of which had their own sets of adaptations to climate,"" said Alice MacQueen, who is a first author of the paper and a research associate at UT Austin.

Knowing which bird species are able to infect ticks with pathogens can help scientists predict where tickborne diseases might emerge and pose a health risk to people.,"A new study published in the journal Lead author Daniel Becker, a Postdoctoral Fellow at Indiana University, says, ""We know birds can infect ticks with the Lyme bacterium; however, until now, no one has systematically studied the ecological and evolutionary drivers that influence which bird species are most likely to host and spread Borrelia burgdorferi on a global scale. We set out to fill this gap by identifying traits of bird species that are most likely to pass Lyme to feeding ticks.""Senior author Barbara Han, a disease ecologist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, says, ""To predict and monitor species that could spread tickborne diseases to people, we first need to know which traits make certain animals good pathogen hosts. Here, we used machine learning to assess bird species traits, paired with Lyme infection data from ticks found on birds, to predict bird species that have the potential to spread Lyme.""In this study, the team searched published literature to locate studies reporting Lyme infection of ticks found feeding on birds. The global search yielded 102 studies, including data from ticks found on 183 bird species; of these, 91 carried ticks that tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi. These bird species are considered 'competent' reservoir species because they are known to infect feeding ticks with Borrelia burgdorferi. Species flagged have a broad range, reaching across the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.Next, machine learning was used to compare traits of competent bird species with 4691 other bird species. Data included information on life history features like diet composition, foraging location, body size, lifespan, reproductive rate, and fledgling age, as well as geographical information like migration distance, global dispersal, and maximum elevation. They also looked at baseline corticosterone -- the stress hormone in birds -- which can influence susceptibility to infection.The model identified birds that were known to spread Lyme to ticks with 80% accuracy, and revealed 21 new species that should be prioritized for surveillance based on sharing traits with known competent species. High-risk species tend to have low baseline corticosterone, breed and winter at high latitudes and low elevations, are broadly distributed, and occur on either extreme of the pace-of-life continuum (species that breed early and die young, or breed late and are longer lived).Species from the genus Turdus, commonly known as true thrushes, were found to have a significantly greater likelihood of competence compared to other taxa. This finding suggests that thrushes might be the riskiest bird species for Lyme transmission. Passerines, or perching birds, also tended to have higher competence, as did birds that primarily eat seeds and those that forage on the ground -- a behavior that would put them in reach of questing ticks.Identifying Lyme-competent bird species could have direct implications for our health. Tickborne diseases, especially Lyme disease, can be difficult to diagnose. Knowing where ticks and the diseases they carry are spreading can help medical practitioners prepare for diagnosis and treatment, improving health outcomes for patients.Due to climate change, the breeding ranges of many birds are shifting north. As birds spread into higher latitudes, so do ticks and pathogens. Some bird species have taken up full or part-time residence in cities and suburbs. Birds that can succeed in developed environments, especially those that are overwintering in these new places in close proximity to people, increase residents' risk of contracting a tickborne disease.Becker says, ""Birds don't spread Lyme directly to people, but they can carry infected ticks to new locations with no history of Lyme occurrence. A tick could drop off a bird and into a garden or yard, where it could later bite and infect a person. If local medical practitioners are unfamiliar with Lyme symptoms, proper diagnosis could be delayed. Identifying where ticks are spreading could improve medical response to Lyme and other tickborne diseases.""Han concludes, ""These findings remind us that pathogen competence varies tremendously, even among animals of the same family. Machine learning techniques allow us to analyze animal traits and help us predict risky species on a global scale -- not only for Lyme, but for other tickborne and zoonotic diseases that involve multiple host species. These predictions could provide crucial information to guide early interventions, prevent disease spillover, and protect our health.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new study has identified bird species that are most likely to spread Lyme disease to humans.

But new research from Princeton University shows that carbon molecules can potentially escape the soil much faster than previously thought. The findings suggest a key role for some types of soil bacteria, which can produce enzymes that break down large carbon-based molecules and allow carbon dioxide to escape into the air.","More carbon is stored in soil than in all the planet's plants and atmosphere combined, and soil absorbs about 20% of human-generated carbon emissions. Yet, factors that affect carbon storage and release from soil have been challenging to study, placing limits on the relevance of soil carbon models for predicting climate change. The new results help explain growing evidence that large carbon molecules can be released from soil more quickly than is assumed in common models.""We provided a new insight, which is the surprising role of biology and its linkage to whether carbon remains stored"" in soil, said coauthor Howard Stone, the Donald R. Dixon '69 and Elizabeth W. Dixon Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.In a paper published Jan. 27 in The ""chip"" was a modified microscope slide, or a microfluidic device, containing silicone-walled channels half a centimeter long and several times the width of a human hair (about 400 micrometers). Inlet and outlet tubes at each end of the channels allowed the researchers to inject the synthetic clay solution, followed by suspensions containing carbon molecules, bacteria or enzymes.After coating the channels with the see-through clay, the researchers added fluorescently labeled sugar molecules to simulate carbon-containing nutrients that leak from plants' roots, particularly during rainfall. The experiments enabled the researchers to directly observe carbon compounds' locations within the clay and their movements in response to fluid flow in real time.Both small and large sugar-based molecules stuck to the synthetic clay as they flowed through the device. Consistent with current models, small molecules were easily dislodged, while larger ones remained trapped in the clay.When the researchers added Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common soil bacterium, to the soil-on-a-chip device, the bacteria could not reach the nutrients lodged within the clay's small pores. However, the enzyme dextranase, which represents enzymes released by certain soil bacteria, could break down the nutrients within the synthetic clay and make smaller sugar molecules available to fuel bacterial metabolism. In the environment, this could lead large amounts of CO2 to be released from soil into the atmosphere.Researchers have often assumed that larger carbon compounds are protected from release once they stick to clay surfaces, resulting in long-term carbon storage. Some recent field studies have shown that these compounds can detach from clay, but the reason for this has been mysterious, said lead author Yang, who conducted the research as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton and is now an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota.""This is a very important phenomenon, because it's suggesting that the carbon sequestered in the soil can be released [and play a role in] future climate change,"" said Yang. ""We are providing direct evidence of how this carbon can be released -- we found out that the enzymes produced by bacteria play an important role, but this has often been ignored by climate modeling studies"" that assume clay protects carbon in soils for thousands of years.The study sprang from conversations between Stone and coauthor Ian Bourg, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and the High Meadows Environmental Institute. Stone's lab has used microfluidic devices to study the properties of synthetic fibers and bacterial biofilms, while Bourg has expertise in the surface geochemistry of clay minerals -- which are thought to contribute most to soil carbon storage due to their fine-scale structure and surface charges.Stone, Bourg and their colleagues realized there was a need to experimentally test some of the assumptions in widely used models of carbon storage. Yang joined Stone's group to lead the research, and also collaborated with Xinning Zhang, an assistant professor of geosciences and the High Meadows Environmental Institute who investigates the metabolisms of bacteria and their interactions with the soil environment.Jinyun Tang, a research scientist in the climate sciences department at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, noted that in recent years he and others have observed the degradation of large carbon molecules in soils and hypothesized that it was mediated by biologically produced enzymes.The Princeton team's observations ""provide a very strong support to our hypothesis,"" said Tang, who was not involved in the study. He added that the study's technique could also be used to explore such questions as ""Will the reversible interaction between small-size carbon molecules and clay particles induce carbon starvation to the microbes and contribute to carbon stabilization? And how do such interactions help maintain microbial diversity in soil? It is a very exciting start.""Future studies will test whether bacteria in the model system can release their own enzymes to degrade large carbon molecules and use them for energy, releasing COWhile the carbon stabilization Tang described is possible, the newly discovered phenomenon could also have the opposite effect, contributing to a positive feedback loop with the potential to exacerbate the pace of climate change, the study's authors said. Other experiments have shown a ""priming"" effect, in which increases in small sugar molecules in soil lead to release of soil carbon, which may in turn cause bacteria to grow more quickly and release more enzymes to further break down larger carbon molecules, leading to still further increases in bacterial activity.The study was supported by the Grand Challenges program and the Carbon Mitigation Initiative of Princeton's High Meadows Environmental Institute.",Climate,2021.0,"Soil stores more carbon than all the planet's plants and atmosphere combined, and absorbs about 20% of human-generated carbon emissions.

But a new study led by SMU suggests that people living in fire-prone places can learn to manage fire as an ally to prevent dangerous blazes, just like people who lived nearly 1,000 years ago.","""We shouldn't be asking how to avoid fire and smoke,"" said SMU anthropologist and lead author Christopher Roos. ""We should ask ourselves what kind of fire and smoke do we want to coexist with.""An interdisciplinary team of scientists published a study in the journal Jemez people learned how to live with and manage fire long agoAncestors of the Native American community in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico lived continuously in fire-prone forests for more than five centuries. Similar to today's communities in the western U.S. forests, Pueblos of the Jemez people had relatively high population densities, and the forested landscape they managed was an area larger than the city of Chicago.Starting in the 1100s, the Jemez people limited fire spread and improved forest resilience to climate variability by creating purposeful burning of small patches of the forest around their community, researchers found.""The area around each village would have been a fire-free zone,"" Roos said. ""There were no living trees within two football fields of each village, and the hundreds or thousands of trampling feet mean that fine fuels, such as grasses, herbs, and shrubs, to carry surface fires would have been rare too. The agricultural areas would have seen targeted applications of fire to clean fields after harvest, to recycle plant nutrients as fertilizer, and to clear new fields.""Roos calls those controlled burns ""the right kind of fire and smoke."" The Jemez practice of burning wood for heat, light, and cooking in their homes also removed much of the fuel that could burn in wildfires, he said.Roos said the ancient Jemez model could work today. Many communities in the western United States, including those of Native Americans, still rely on wood-burning to generate heat during the winter, he said. Regularly setting small, low-intensity fires in a patchwork around where people live to clear out flammable material would also follow the Jemez model, he said.""Some sort of public-private tribal partnership might do a lot of good, empowering tribal communities to oversee the removal of the small trees that have overstocked the forests and made them vulnerable to dangerous fires, while also providing wood fuel for people who need it,"" Roos said.Since 2018, wildfires have destroyed more than 50,000 structures in California alone. Global warming is only expected to make the amount and severity of wildfires worse.Almost every major study of fire activity over the last 10,000 years indicates that climate drives fire activity, particular larger fires. Yet, many examples from traditional societies suggest the role of climate can be blunted or buffered by a patchwork of small, purposeful burns before the peak natural fire season. In the Jemez Mountains, the climate influence was weakened and large fires were rare when Jemez farmers used fire preemptively in many small patches, effectively clearing out the materials that fuel today's megafires.In contrast, today's forests are filled with these young trees, increasing the chances they can generate huge flames and waves of flaming embers that can catch homes on fire.The scientists used a variety of methods to document how Jemez people handled smoke and fire centuries ago, including interviewing tribal elders at Jemez Pueblo. The team also compared tree-ring fire records with paleoclimate records, which indicated that fire activity was disconnected from climate during the time when Jemez's population was at a peak. In addition, charcoal and pollen records show that Jemez people began using fire to establish an agricultural landscape and to promote habitats for large animals, such as mule deer and elk.Roos noted that tolerance of fire and smoke hazards probably went hand-in-hand with recognition of the benefits of fire and smoke.""Paul Tosa, former governor of Jemez Pueblo, said 'Fire brings richness to the land,'"" Roos noted.

This rise in temperature can lead to rapid physiological changes in these reef fishes, which could have long-term effects on survival.""We found that the fusilier rapidly responded to thermal stress, with nearly immediate changes detected in gill shape and structure and blood parameters, however, the cardinalfish exhibited a delayed response and was far less able to adjust to the elevated temperatures,"" said Jacob Johansen, Ph.D., a co-author of the study who is an assistant research professor at the University of Hawaii's Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at Manoa.""More importantly, we identified seven parameters across both species that may be useful as biomarkers for evaluating how fast and to what extent coral reef fishes can cope with increasing temperatures.

Their work is the subject of a study published recently in ","Working under the auspices of the Oceans Melting Greenland mission for the past five years, the researchers used ships and aircraft to survey 226 glaciers in all sectors of one of Earth's largest islands. They found that 74 glaciers situated in deep, steep-walled valleys accounted for nearly half of Greenland's total ice loss between 1992 and 2017.Such fjord-bound glaciers were discovered to be the most subject to undercutting, a process by which warm, salty water at the bottom of the canyons melts the ice from below, causing the masses to break apart more quickly than usual. In contrast, the team found that 51 glaciers positioned in shallower gullies experienced less undercutting and contributed only about 15 percent of the total ice loss.""I was surprised by how lopsided it was. The biggest and deepest glaciers are undercut much faster than the smaller glaciers in shallow fjords,"" said lead author Michael Wood, a post-doctorate researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, who began this research as a doctoral student at UCI. ""In other words, the biggest glaciers are the most sensitive to the warming waters and those are the ones really driving Greenland's ice loss.""The study highlighted the dynamic whereby deeper fjords allow the intrusion of warmer ocean water than shallow ones, hastening the process of undercutting with some of Greenland's largest glaciers.Greenland is home to one of Earth's only two ice sheets, the largest being Antarctica's. The ice in Greenland is more than two miles (three kilometers) thick in places. At the edges of the land mass, the vast glaciers extending from the ice sheet travel slowly down valleys like icy conveyor belts, which inch into the fjords and then melt or break off as icebergs. The ice is replenished by snowfall that is compressed over time into the ice pack.If the ice sheet were in balance, the amount of snow accumulating on the top would roughly equal the ice lost from melt, evaporation and calving -- chunks breaking free from anchored masses and floating off into the ocean.But the ice sheet has been out of balance since the 1990s. Melt has accelerated and calving has increased, causing glaciers that extend into the sea to retreat back toward land. Together, these are resulting the ice sheet shrinkage.According to the research team, the build-up of warm salty water at the bottom of fjords has been accelerated by increasing temperatures in the summer months, which heat the surfaces of glaciers, creating pools of meltwater. This liquid leaks through cracks in the ice to form subsurface freshwater rivers which flows into the sea where it interacts with salty water beneath fjords.Glacier meltwater is free of salt, so it is lighter than seawater and rises to the surface as a plume, dragging up warm water and putting it in contact with the bottoms of glaciers. Fjord depth is a fairly immutable factor, but other factors such as seawater temperature and the amount of meltwater from glaciers surfaces are greatly impacted by climate warming. All three factors combine to cause accelerated deterioration of Greenland's ice sheet, the researchers said.As the water temperature around Greenland's coastline is predicted to continue to increase in the future, these findings suggest that some climate models may underestimate glacial ice loss by at least a factor of two if they do not account for undercutting by a warm ocean.The study also lends insight into why many of Greenland's glaciers never recovered after an abrupt ocean warming between 1998 and 2007, which caused an increase in ocean temperature by nearly 2 degrees Celsius. Although ocean warming paused between 2008 and 2017, the glaciers had already experienced such extreme undercutting in the previous decade that they continued to retreat at an accelerated rate.""We have known for well over a decade that the warmer ocean plays a major role in the evolution of Greenland glaciers,"" said OMG deputy principal investigator Eric Rignot, also of JPL and UCI. ""But for the first time, we have been able to quantify the undercutting effect and demonstrate its dominant impact on the glacier retreat over the past 20 years.""",Climate,2021.0,"Glaciers in deep, steep-walled valleys are the most susceptible to melting from below by warm, salty water, according to a study by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The problem is that most corals grow in tropical waters that are poor in nutrients, sort of like ocean deserts; it's this lack of nutrients that makes the water around coral reefs so crystal clear. Because food is not readily available, corals have developed a remarkable feeding mechanism that involves a symbiotic relationship with single-celled algae. These algae grow inside the corals, using the coral tissue as shelter and absorbing the CO2 that the corals produce. In exchange, the algae provide corals with nutrients they produce through photosynthesis. These algae contain a variety of pigments, which give the coral reefs the colors they're known for.","Over the past 35 years, tropical oceans have experienced multiple major heat waves. Scientists have observed that during these episodes, the algae -- stressed by the warmer temperatures -- release compounds that are toxic to the coral, prompting the coral to expel the algae from their tissue. That means the corals lose their color and their primary food source, and then begin to starve. This is the process of coral bleaching. And it has been occurring more and more frequently, threatening the survival of many reefs, including Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Bleached corals do not necessarily die; their symbiotic algae population can be reestablished if the conditions around a reef return to normal. But if the heat persists, or is aggravated by other factors like pollution, the coral becomes too weak to survive.In a paper published in Scientists already knew that ocean warming is the main factor causing the symbiotic relationship to break down. But what Rädecker's team discovered was that the coral is already in a stressed state and lacking nutrients even before the algae begin releasing toxic compounds. ""The roots of the problem are much deeper than we thought, and they involve an early breakdown of the metabolic exchanges in these fascinating organisms,"" says Anders Meibom, the head of LGB and a coral expert.Rädecker spent more than a year studying a coral reef just off the coast of Thuwal, Saudi Arabia -- the city where the Red Sea Research Center, part of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, is located. He then replicated these environmental conditions in the aquaria at the Center so that he could investigate the corals under controlled conditions. The data were then analyzed at several laboratories, including EPFL and the Biology Department at the University of Konstanz in Germany.""Based on what we found, we can determine which environmental conditions other than temperature (such as water quality) stress the corals in a reef, and use this information to predict whether the reef will bleach. Our findings can also be used to identify corals that are particularly resistant to bleaching, like those in the Gulf of Aqaba and elsewhere in the Red Sea. That will tell scientists which reefs should be protected because they have a better chance of survival,"" says Rädecker.According to Meibom, this study makes a major contribution to coral research and sheds new light on earlier observations. ""Nils' research has uncovered metabolic mechanisms that play a fundamental role in the coral bleaching process -- and that we didn't understand the importance of until now. I believe he found the key to what's actually going on inside corals when they're stressed by global warming,"" he says.",Climate,2021.0,"Coral reefs are at risk of dying off due to bleaching caused by multiple major heat waves in tropical oceans over the past 35 years.

The work is a first step in determining how a wetter climate may affect the estuarine ecosystem.","Picophytoplankton are defined as any phytoplankton measuring less than three micrometers in size. Although well studied as part of the oceanic ecosystem and food web, picophytoplankton are understudied in estuarine systems, even though they occur in significant numbers within these environments.""Picophytoplankton are important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems,"" says Ryan Paerl, assistant professor of marine, earth and atmospheric sciences and lead author of the research. ""They provide food for larger microorganisms, play a role in carbon fixation and cycling, and are sentinels of good ecosystem health. So understanding the effect of moderate to extreme precipitation events on these tiniest members of the ecosystem gives us a more complete sense of impacts of storms on estuaries and the life within them.""Paerl and his team conducted a study of picophytoplankton numbers and composition in the Neuse River Estuary -- a major component of the second largest estuary in the lower U.S. -- from July 2017 to December 2018, taking monthly or bimonthly samples at 11 sites along the estuary and using flow cytometry to identify the amount and composition of picophytoplankton.During ""stable"" conditions -- warm, sunny weather -- picophytoplankton were found in concentrations of 1 million cells per milliliter. However, increased precipitation overall and the arrival of Hurricane Florence in September 2018 had huge impacts on the picophytoplankton in the estuary, bringing numbers down at least a thousand-fold, to 1,000 cells per milliliter or fewer.The composition of picophytoplankton changed following these extreme weather events as well, from primarily cyanobacteria to primarily picoeukaryotic phytoplankton (PEUK).""We saw that precipitation and resulting increased river flow acts like a hose on these picophytoplankton, flushing them out of the estuary,"" Paerl says. ""Then the PEUKs have mini-blooms after the flushing events. They do really well and grow very quickly after disturbances.

Now, researchers at MIT have developed a method that could significantly boost the performance of systems that use catalytic surfaces to enhance the rates of carbon-sequestering electrochemical reactions.","Such catalytic systems are an attractive option for carbon capture because they can produce useful, valuable products, such as transportation fuels or chemical feedstocks. This output can help to subsidize the process, offsetting the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In these systems, typically a stream of gas containing carbon dioxide passes through water to deliver carbon dioxide for the electrochemical reaction. The movement through water is sluggish, which slows the rate of conversion of the carbon dioxide. The new design ensures that the carbon dioxide stream stays concentrated in the water right next to the catalyst surface. This concentration, the researchers have shown, can nearly double the performance of the system.The results are described today in the journal ""Carbon dioxide sequestration is the challenge of our times,"" Varanasi says. There are a number of approaches, including geological sequestration, ocean storage, mineralization, and chemical conversion. When it comes to making useful, saleable products out of this greenhouse gas, electrochemical conversion is particularly promising, but it still needs improvements to become economically viable. ""The goal of our work was to understand what's the big bottleneck in this process, and to improve or mitigate that bottleneck,"" he says.The bottleneck turned out to involve the delivery of the carbon dioxide to the catalytic surface that promotes the desired chemical transformations, the researchers found. In these electrochemical systems, the stream of carbon dioxide-containing gases is mixed with water, either under pressure or by bubbling it through a container outfitted with electrodes of a catalyst material such as copper. A voltage is then applied to promote chemical reactions producing carbon compounds that can be transformed into fuels or other products.There are two challenges in such systems: The reaction can proceed so fast that it uses up the supply of carbon dioxide reaching the catalyst more quickly than it can be replenished; and if that happens, a competing reaction -- the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen -- can take over and sap much of the energy being put into the reaction.Previous efforts to optimize these reactions by texturing the catalyst surfaces to increase the surface area for reactions had failed to deliver on their expectations, because the carbon dioxide supply to the surface couldn't keep up with the increased reaction rate, thereby switching to hydrogen production over time.The researchers addressed these problems through the use of a gas-attracting surface placed in close proximity to the catalyst material. This material is a specially textured ""gasphilic,"" superhydrophobic material that repels water but allows a smooth layer of gas called a plastron to stay close along its surface. It keeps the incoming flow of carbon dioxide right up against the catalyst so that the desired carbon dioxide conversion reactions can be maximized. By using dye-based pH indicators, the researchers were able to visualize carbon dioxide concentration gradients in the test cell and show that the enhanced concentration of carbon dioxide emanates from the plastron.In a series of lab experiments using this setup, the rate of the carbon conversion reaction nearly doubled. It was also sustained over time, whereas in previous experiments the reaction quickly faded out. The system produced high rates of ethylene, propanol, and ethanol -- a potential automotive fuel. Meanwhile, the competing hydrogen evolution was sharply curtailed. Although the new work makes it possible to fine-tune the system to produce the desired mix of product, in some applications, optimizing for hydrogen production as a fuel might be the desired result, which can also be done.""The important metric is selectivity,"" Khan says, referring to the ability to generate valuable compounds that will be produced by a given mix of materials, textures, and voltages, and to adjust the configuration according to the desired output.By concentrating the carbon dioxide next to the catalyst surface, the new system also produced two new potentially useful carbon compounds, acetone, and acetate, that had not previously been detected in any such electrochemical systems at appreciable rates.In this initial laboratory work, a single strip of the hydrophobic, gas-attracting material was placed next to a single copper electrode, but in future work a practical device might be made using a dense set of interleaved pairs of plates, Varanasi suggests.Compared to previous work on electrochemical carbon reduction with nanostructure catalysts, Varanasi says, ""we significantly outperform them all, because even though it's the same catalyst, it's how we are delivering the carbon dioxide that changes the game.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new design for electrochemical carbon capture systems has been developed by researchers at MIT.

This demographic development has been compared with environmental data for the first time by professor of ancient history, Sabine Huebner of the University of Basel -- leading to a discovery of climate change and its consequences.","The oasis-like Faiyum region, roughly 130 km south-west of Cairo, was the breadbasket of the Roman Empire. Yet at the end of the third century CE, numerous formerly thriving settlements there declined and were ultimately abandoned by their inhabitants. Previous excavations and contemporary papyri have shown that problems with field irrigation were the cause. Attempts by local farmers to adapt to the dryness and desertification of the farmland -- for example, by changing their agricultural practices -- are also documented.Basel professor of ancient history Sabine R. Huebner has now shown in the US journal A powerful tropical volcanic eruption around 266 CE, which in the following year brought a below-average flood of the Nile, presumably also played a role. Major eruptions are known from sulfuric acid deposits in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, and can be dated to within three years. Particles hurled up into the stratosphere lead to a cooling of the climate, disrupting the local monsoon system.In the third century CE, the entire Roman Empire was hit by crises that are relatively well documented in the province of Egypt by more than 26,000 preserved papyri (documents written on sheets of papyrus). In the Faiyum region, these include records of inhabitants who switched to growing vines instead of grain or to sheep farming due to the scarcity of water. Others accused their neighbors of water theft or turned to the Roman authorities for tax relief. These and other adaptive strategies of the population delayed the death of their villages for several decades.""Like today, the consequences of climate change were not the same everywhere,"" says Huebner.

This has been mainly driven by steep rises in losses from the polar ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland.Lead author Dr Thomas Slater, a Research Fellow at Leeds' Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling , said: ""Although every region we studied lost ice, losses from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have accelerated the most.""The ice sheets are now following the worst-case climate warming scenarios set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea-level rise on this scale will have very serious impacts on coastal communities this century.""Dr Slater said the study was the first of its kind to examine all the ice that is disappearing on Earth, using satellite observations .He added: ""Over the past three decades there's been a huge international effort to understand what's happening to individual components in Earth's ice system, revolutionised by satellites which allow us to routinely monitor the vast and inhospitable regions where ice can be found.""Our study is the first to combine these efforts and look at all the ice that is being lost from the entire planet.""The increase in ice loss has been triggered by warming of the atmosphere and oceans, which have warmed by 0.26°C and 0.12°C per decade since the 1980, respectively. The majority of all ice loss was driven by atmospheric melting (68 %), with the remaining losses (32%) being driven by oceanic melting.The survey covers 215,000 mountain glaciers spread around the planet, the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the ice shelves floating around Antarctica, and sea ice drifting in the Arctic and Southern Oceans.Rising atmospheric temperatures have been the main driver of the decline in Arctic sea ice and mountain glaciers across the globe, while rising ocean temperatures have increased the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. For the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctic ice shelves, ice losses have been triggered by a combination of rising ocean and atmospheric temperatures.During the survey period, every category lost ice, but the biggest losses were from Arctic Sea ice (7.6 trillion tons) and Antarctic ice shelves (6.5 trillion tons), both of which float on the polar oceans.Dr Isobel Lawrence, a Research Fellow at Leeds' Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said: ""Sea ice loss doesn't contribute directly to sea level rise but it does have an indirect influence. One of the key roles of Arctic sea ice is to reflect solar radiation back into space which helps keep the Arctic cool.""As the sea ice shrinks, more solar energy is being absorbed by the oceans and atmosphere, causing the Arctic to warm faster than anywhere else on the planet.""Not only is this speeding up sea ice melt, it's also exacerbating the melting of glaciers and ice sheets which causes sea levels to rise.""Half of all losses were from ice on land -- including 6.1 trillion tons from mountain glaciers, 3.8 trillion tons from the Greenland ice sheet, and 2.5 trillion tons from the Antarctic ice sheet. These losses have raised global sea levels by 35 millimetres.It is estimated that for every centimetre of sea level rise, approximately a million people are in danger of being displaced from low-lying homelands.Despite storing only 1 % of the Earth's total ice volume, glaciers have contributed to almost a quarter of the global ice losses over the study period, with all glacier regions around the world losing ice.Report co-author and PhD researcher Inès Otosaka, also from Leeds' Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said: ""As well as contributing to global mean sea level rise, mountain glaciers are also critical as a freshwater resource for local communities.""The retreat of glaciers around the world is therefore of crucial importance at both local and global scales.""Just over half (58 %) of the ice loss was from the northern hemisphere, and the remainder (42 %) was from the southern hemisphere.",Climate,2021.0,"The Earth has lost 28 trillion tonnes of ice between 1994 and 2017, with the rate of ice loss increasing from 0.8 trillion tons per year in the 1990s to 1.3 trillion tons per year by 2017, according to a survey of global ice loss using satellite data led by the University of Leeds.

The Greenland ice sheet -- the second largest ice body in the world after the Antarctic ice sheet -- covers almost 80% of the surface of Greenland. Over the last 25 years, surface melting and water runoff from the ice sheet has increased by about 40%. The international research team, led by the University of Leeds, analysed samples from the southwestern margin on Greenland's 1.7 million km² ice sheet over two years. They discovered that phosphorus containing minerals may be driving ever-larger algal blooms on the Greenland Ice Sheet. As the algal blooms grow they darken the ice surface, decreasing albedo -- the ability to reflect sunlight. The blooms cause increased melting thus contributing to higher sea levels. In particular, a band of low-albedo ice, known as the Dark Zone, has developed along the western margin of the massive ice sheet.","The research, published in By examining the surface dust, the scientists were able to demonstrate how phosphorus is used as a key nutrient to help the algae grow, identifying the phosphorus-bearing mineral hydroxylapatite as the source of fuel for the blooms in the Dark Zone.

In a study published today in,"Throughout Earth's history, global climate and the global carbon cycle have undergone significant changes, some of which challenge the current understanding of carbon cycle dynamics.Less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere cools Earth and decreases weathering of rocks and minerals on land over long time scales.

This ""new particle formation"" occurs when sunlight reacts with molecules of trace gases in the marine boundary layer, the atmosphere within about the first kilometer above Earth's surface. The findings, published in the journal ","""When we say 'new particle formation,' we're talking about individual gas molecules, sometimes just a few atoms in size, reacting with sunlight,"" said study co-author Chongai Kuang, a member of the Environmental and Climate Sciences Department at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. ""It's interesting to think about how something of that scale can have such an impact on our climate -- on how much energy gets reflected or trapped in our atmosphere,"" he said.But modeling the details of how aerosol particles form and grow, and how water molecules condense on them to become cloud droplets and clouds, while taking into consideration how different aerosol properties (e.g., their size, number, and spatial distribution) affect those processes is extremely complex -- especially if you don't know where all the aerosols are coming from. So a team of scientists from Brookhaven and collaborators in atmospheric research around the world set out to collect data in a relatively pristine ocean environment. In that setting, they expected the concentration of trace gases to be low and the formation of clouds to be particularly sensitive to aerosol properties -- an ideal ""laboratory"" for disentangling the complex interactions.""This was an experiment that really leveraged broad and collaborative expertise at Brookhaven in aerosol observations and cloud observations,"" Kuang said. Three of the lead researchers -- lead authors Guangjie Zheng and Yang Wang, and Jian Wang, principal investigator of the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) campaign -- began their involvement with the project while working at Brookhaven and have remained close collaborators with the Lab since moving to Washington University in St. Louis in 2018.The study made use of a long-term ground-based sampling station on Graciosa Island in the Azores (an archipelago 850 miles west of continental Portugal) and a Gulfstream-1 aircraft outfitted with 55 atmospheric instrument systems to take measurements at different altitudes over the island and out at sea. Both the ground station and aircraft belong to the DOE Office of Science's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility, managed and operated by a consortium of nine DOE national laboratories.The team flew the aircraft on ""porpoise flights,"" ascending and descending through the boundary layer to get vertical profiles of the particles and precursor gas molecules present at different altitudes. And they coordinated these flights with measurements taken from the ground station.The scientists hadn't expected new particle formation to be happening in the boundary layer in this environment because they expected the concentration of the critical precursor trace gases would be too low.""But there were particles that we measured at the surface that were larger than newly formed particles, and we just didn't know where they came from,"" Kuang said.The aircraft measurements gave them their answer.""This aircraft had very specific flight patterns during the measurement campaign,"" Kuang said. ""They saw evidence that new particle formation was happening aloft -- not at the surface but in the upper boundary layer."" The evidence included a combination of elevated concentrations of small particles, low concentrations of pre-existing aerosol surface area, and clear signs that reactive trace gases such as dimethyl sulfide were being transported vertically -- along with atmospheric conditions favorable for those gases to react with sunlight.""Then, once these aerosol particles form, they attract additional gas molecules, which condense and cause the particles to grow to around 80-90 nanometers in diameter. These larger particles then get transported downward -- and that's what we're measuring at the surface,"" Kuang said.""The surface measurements plus the aircraft measurements give us a really good spatial sense of the aerosol processes that are happening,"" he noted.At a certain size, the particles grow large enough to attract water vapor, which condenses to form cloud droplets, and eventually clouds.Both the individual aerosol particles suspended in the atmosphere and the clouds they ultimately form can reflect and/or absorb sunlight and affect Earth's temperature, Kuang explained.So now that the scientists know new aerosol particles are forming over the open ocean, what can they do with that information?""We'll take this knowledge of what is happening and make sure this process is captured in simulations of Earth's climate system,"" Kuang said.Another important question: ""If this is such a clean environment, then where are all these precursor gases coming from?"" Kuang asked. ""There are some important precursor gases generated by biological activity in the ocean (e.g., dimethyl sulfide) that may also lead to new particle formation. That can be a nice follow-on study to this one -- exploring those sources.""Understanding the fate of biogenic gases such as dimethyl sulfide, which is a very important source of sulfur in the atmosphere, is key to improving scientists' ability to predict how changes in ocean productivity will affect aerosol formation and, by extension, climate.The research was funded by the DOE Office of Science, DOE's Atmospheric System Research, and by NASA.

Female caribou are unique among deer for growing and shedding antlers each year like males.The study is timely given the auction this year of oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Indigenous Gwich'in opposed the leases, arguing development could disrupt the migration of caribou they depend on for sustenance.An international team of researchers led by UC geologist Joshua Miller focused on the antlers of female caribou, which are shed within a few days of giving birth each spring. The location where antlers drop marks their spring calving grounds.Caribou then spend the summer growing a new pair of antlers.Miller and his collaborators found that analyses of isotopes from the antlers could not only identify one caribou herd from another but also identify changes in their summer range over time.Miller, an assistant professor in UC's College of Arts and Sciences, traveled extensively across the Arctic during five expeditions with collaborators from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Using inflatable boats, the team navigated rivers, avoiding bears and enduring mosquitoes to collect caribou antlers across the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska.""It's one of the most remote places on the planet,"" Miller said. ""So it poses all sorts of logistical challenges. It is a real adventure.""The refuge is home to grizzly and polar bears, musk ox and hundreds of thousands of caribou found in different herds. Caribou are an important staple food for Indigenous Alaskans who seasonally hunt them.Two populations of caribou are found in the Arctic Refuge: the Central Arctic herd and the Porcupine caribou herd, which is named for the Porcupine River that flows in the heart of its range. While caribou numbers can fluctuate year to year, the Porcupine herd is home to about 200,000 caribou. The Central Arctic herd has approximately 60,000 more, though its numbers may be declining.The collected antlers were shipped back to Miller's UC geology lab, where researchers, including UC graduate student Abigail Kelly, prepared them for isotopic analysis.Strontium, which is found virtually everywhere on Earth, is absorbed up the food chain through plants that caribou and other herbivores eat. Strontium exists as different isotopes, which vary with the geology like an isotopic footprint. By comparing the ratios of strontium-87 and strontium-86, researchers could track where the antlers were grown.Since new female antlers grow in just a few months each year, they make an ideal time capsule to identify where a caribou has been feeding.Miller said finding the antlers is straightforward on the flatter terraces of the Arctic Refuge away from the thick grass tussocks.""On these flat areas, they can be everywhere -- more than 1,000 antlers per square kilometer. In some places, you can find one every several steps,"" he said.Some of the antlers had been lying on the tundra for hundreds of years. One was dated to the 1300s.Researchers observed a shift in summer movements among caribou in the Central Arctic herd before and after the 1970s. This coincides with three factors known to alter caribou migration: population growth, climate change and increased human disturbances to their summer and calving ranges.Human development in the 1970s included oil field expansion and construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Previous studies have found that pregnant caribou avoid pipelines and roads while calves born in the vicinity of roads and other development are underweight compared to those living farther from human development.""An important future area of research will be to test this shift in preferred summer landscapes using an expanded sampling of antlers shed across each herd's calving grounds,"" researchers said.Scientists only began studying caribou migration using radio telemetry in the 1970s and '80s.

Since the start of their southbound migration from their high latitude feeding grounds, several sightings of emaciated gray whales have already been reported along their migration route.","This has raised concern among scientists that the unusual mortality event (UME, an unexpected phenomenon during which a significant number of a marine mammal population dies), that started in January 2019, and which so far has resulted in 378 confirmed gray whale deaths, and possibly many more unrecorded, is entering its third year.The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is the only living species in the family Eschrichtiidae, in honour of the Danish zoologist Daniel Frederik Eschricht. Gray whales undertake annual migrations between feeding grounds in the Bering, Chukchi, and Arctic Seas, and breeding grounds from the Southern California Bight to lagoons along the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico.During the summer feeding season, between May and October, the whales build up large amount of energy reserves, mainly in the form of blubber, to support the energetic costs of migration and while residing on the breeding grounds. Sufficient energy reserves is crucial for the reproduction and survival of gray whales, which do not feed during the migration and breeding season.Mary Lou Jones and Steven Swartz, co-author on the current paper, conducted the first research and monitoring of the gray whales from 1977 to 1982 in Laguna San Ignacio (LSI) in Baja California Sur, Mexico. In 2006 with their colleague Dr Jorge Urban, co-author on the current paper, they initiated the Laguna San Ignacio Ecosystem Science Program (LSIESP), a project of the Ocean Foundation, which is a partnership with the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur (UABCS) and international collaborators.In 2017, Dr Fredrik Christiansen from the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies and the Dept. of Zoology at Aarhus University, and Professor Lars Bejder from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, joined LSIESP to study the body condition of gray whales with the use of drone photogrammetry. The technique involves measuring the body length and width of gray whales from vertical photographs taken by drones above the whales, from which a measure of relative body condition (or fatness) of individual whales can be obtained.Already in the second year of sampling, the researchers found a marked decline in the body condition of juvenile and adult gray whales visiting Laguna San Ignacio. The decline was also visible in 2019, at the start of the current UME. The decline in body condition also coincided with a drop in the number of mother-calf pairs sighted in Laguna San Ignacio, which indicated a reduction in the reproductive rate of female gray whales.A similar UME occurred in 1999-2000, when 651 gray whales were recorded dead along the west coast of North America. During that two-year event, the gray whale population declined with about 25% from about 21,000 animals in 1998 to about 16,000 in 2002. It is yet unknown what effects the current UME is having on the eastern North Pacific population.While the study by Dr Fredrik Christiansen and colleagues suggests that the decline in survival and reproductive rates of gray whale during the current UME was caused by starvation, the underlying factors that caused this reduction in body condition has not yet been determined. The fact that gray whales in 2018 and 2019 arrived on their Mexican breeding grounds already in significantly poorer body condition, indicates that this decline must have occurred either during the previous feeding season and/or during the southbound migration.""It appears that a large number of gray whales are leaving their feeding grounds already in a poor nutritional state and by the time they have completed the breeding season in Mexico they have depleted their energy reserves and starve to death,"" says Dr Fredrik Christiansen.A decline in prey availability on the main feeding grounds is hence the most probably explanation for the current UME. Since the late 1980s, there has been a decline in the abundance and biomass of amphipods, the main prey for gray whales, in the central Chirikov Basin, the main feeding area for gray whales in the Bering Sea. This in turn is believed to be caused by warming of Arctic waters as a result of natural and/or human-induced climate change. If that is the case, UMEs like this one might become more frequent, which could result in a decline in gray whale numbers in coming decades.As the world keeps struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic, LSIESP researchers are preparing for the 2021 field season in Laguna San Ignacio to hopefully get one step closer to understanding the full extent of the current gray whale UME.",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists are concerned that the unusual mortality event (UME) affecting gray whales, which began in January 2019 and has resulted in 378 confirmed deaths, may be entering its third year.

Globally, flood risk is projected to increase in the future, driven by climate change and population growth. The role of dams in flood mitigation, previously unaccounted for, was found to decrease by approximately 15% the number of people globally exposed to historical once-in-100-year floods, downstream of dams during the 21st century.Currently, about half of major river systems worldwide are regulated by dams and more than 3,700 major dams are planned or under construction. Consequently, to realistically assess population exposure to present and future floods, current and future dam landscapes must be integrated into existing flood modeling frameworks.Accounting for dams in river flood simulations, the number of people exposed to the historical once-in-100-year flood below dams were 7.2 and 13.4 million on average over 2006-2099 given a low and a medium-high greenhouse gas emission trajectory (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, respectively). The populations exposed to flooding below dams decreased on average by 16.3% and 12.8% for the two trajectories compared to simulations not accounting for the flow regulations produced by dams. At the end of the 21st century, the decrease was further extended to 20.6% and 12.9% respectively.To maintain the levels of flood protection that dams have provided, new dam operations will be required to offset the effect of climate change, possibly negatively affecting energy production and water storage.

To gain insight into future ice sheet stability and sea-level rise, new research from an international team led by University of South Florida geoscientists is drawing on evidence from past interglacial periods when Earth's climate was warmer than today.","Using deposits in the caves of the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, known as phreatic overgrowths on speleothems, to reconstruct past sea level stands, the team was able to determine that the vertical extent of these unique deposits corresponds with the amplitude of the fluctuating water table, said author USF geosciences Professor Bogdan Onac.

Despite their uniqueness and key functional role in the ocean, they are still partially unknown ecosystems, which still lack of thorough procedures to protect them from human-derived disturbances. In fact, they are considered vulnerable marine ecosystems by the United Nations, the OSPAR Commission and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.Now, an international team of scientists from the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC) and the NOC has studied for the first time the main drivers that control the development of cold-water reefs in the Western Mediterranean during the last 400,000 years. In these reefs, the deeper you go, the older the corals will be, since new generations grow on top of the previous ones. The results of this research are collected in a paper published recently in the journal To carry out the study, researchers made use of Laser Ablation U-series dating, a new technique consisting of ablating and ionising samples with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to determine the age of 110 cold-water coral skeletons. Combined with other analyses, these allowed them to describe when the main periods of reef formation occurred and which were the main environmental drivers of coral reef formation in this region.According to this work, cold-water corals have been growing almost continuously in the Mediterranean for the last 400,000 years, even before the appearance of the first Neanderthals. Nonetheless, they might have started to form much earlier, as only the shallower part -10 m- of the entire reef height -80-90 m- could be described in this study.The analyses of the semi-fossil corals acquired showed that coral growth and reef formation was affected by major changes in climate over this time period. ""Climate swings associated with ice ages, such as changes in sea surface productivity and sea-level variations appear to be the main factors controlling the development of these cold-water coral reefs,"" explains Guillem Corbera, PhD student from NOC and the University of Southampton.""In addition, intense and prolonged monsoon events that mainly affected the Eastern Mediterranean Sea had a detrimental impact for the development of these reefs, located 1000s of kilometers away in the Westernmost Mediterranean,"" adds Corbera.""Throughout the last 400,000 years, depending on the climate conditions, different species of corals dominated these reefs, which created impressive geo-forms in the deep ocean.

Its cubic crystal structure and its strong chemical bonds give it its unique hardness. For thousands of years, it has also been sought after as both a tool and as a thing of beauty. Only in the 1950s did it become possible to produce diamonds artificially for the first time.","Most natural diamonds form in the Earth's mantle at depths of at least 150 kilometres, where temperatures in excess of 1500 degrees Celsius and enormously high pressures of several gigapascals prevail -- more than 10,000 times that of a well-inflated bicycle tyre. There are different theories for the exact mechanisms that are responsible for their formation. The starting material is carbonate-rich melts, i.e. compounds of magnesium, calcium or silicon which are rich in both oxygen and carbon.Because electro-chemical processes take place in the Earth's mantle and the melts and liquids that exist there can have a high electrical conductivity, researchers led by Yuri Palyanov of the V. S. Sobolev Institute of Geology and Mineralogy SB of the Russian Academy of Sciences Novosibirsk developed a model for the formation of diamonds in which highly localised electrical fields play a central role. According to this concept, applying less than even one volt -- a voltage lower than that provided by most household batteries -- provides electrons that trigger a chemical transformation process. These available electrons make it possible for certain carbon-oxygen compounds of the carbonates to become CO2 through a series of chemical reactions, ultimately leading to pure carbon in the form of diamond.To test their theory, the Russian research team developed a sophisticated experimental facility: A millimetre-sized platinum capsule was surrounded by a heating system which in turn was placed in a high-pressure apparatus needed to produce immense pressures of up to 7.5 gigapascals. Tiny, carefully constructed electrodes led into the capsule, which had been filled with carbonate or carbonate-silicate powders. Numerous experiments were run at temperatures between 1300 and 1600°C, some of which lasted for as long as 40 hours.The experiments conducted in Novosibirsk showed, as predicted, that tiny diamonds grow in the vicinity of the negative electrode over the course of several hours, but this happened only when a small voltage was applied; half a volt was already enough. With a diameter reaching a maximum of 200 micrometres, i.e. one fifth of a millimetre, the newly created crystals were smaller than a typical grain of sand. Furthermore, as expected, the other pure-carbon mineral graphite was found to form in experiments conducted at lower pressures. Further proof of the new mechanism came when the researcher reversed the voltage polarity -- diamonds then grew on the other electrode, exactly as expected. Without any voltage being suppled from outside the capsule neither graphite nor diamonds formed. In the vicinity of the diamonds, other minerals that are associated with the Earth's deep mantle were also found.""The experimental facilities in Novosibirsk are absolutely impressive,"" says Michael Wiedenbeck, head of the SIMS laboratory at the GFZ, which is part of Potsdam's Modular Earth Science Infrastructure (MESI). He has been cooperating with the Russian researchers for more than ten years; he along with SIMS laboratory engineer Frédéric Couffignal, analysed diamonds produced by their Russian colleagues. In order to determine whether Yuri Palyanov's theory on diamond formation is completely correct, the isotopic composition of the diamonds had to be characterised very precisely.The Potsdam researchers used secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for this purpose. The Potsdam instrument is a highly specialized mass spectrometer, providing geoscientists from all over the world with high precision data from extremely small samples. ""With this technology we can determine the composition of tiny areas on sub-millimetre samples with great precision,"" says Wiedenbeck. Thus, less than one billionth of a gram from a laboratory produced diamond needed to be removed using a very precisely targeted ion beam. Electrically charged atoms were then injected into a six metre long apparatus which separated each the billions of particles based on their individual mass. This technology makes it possible to separate chemical elements, and in particular it is possible to distinguish their lighter or heavier variants known as isotopes. ""In this way we have shown that the ratio between the carbon isotopes 13C to 12C behaves exactly according the model developed by our colleagues in Novosibirsk. With this, we have contributed to the final piece of the puzzle, so to speak, to confirm this theory,"" says Wiedenbeck. However, it must be noted that this new method is not suitable for the mass production of large artificial diamonds.""Our results clearly show that electric fields should be considered as an important additional factor that influences the crystallisation of diamonds. This observation may prove to be quite significant for understanding carbon isotope ratios shifts within the global carbon cycle,"" Yuri Polyanov sums up.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers at the V. S.

But nobody was there to bundle up more than 3 billion years ago.","The ancient Martian crater is the focus of a study by Rice University scientists comparing data from the Curiosity rover to places on Earth where similar geologic formations have experienced weathering in different climates.Iceland's basaltic terrain and cool weather, with temperatures typically less than 38 degrees Fahrenheit, turned out to be the closest analog to ancient Mars. The study determined that temperature had the biggest impact on how rocks formed from sediment deposited by ancient Martian streams were weathered by climate.The study by postdoctoral alumnus Michael Thorpe and Martian geologist Kirsten Siebach of Rice and geoscientist Joel Hurowitz of State University of New York at Stony Brook set out to answer questions about the forces that affected sands and mud in the ancient lakebed.Data collected by Curiosity during its travels since landing on Mars in 2012 provide details about the chemical and physical states of mudstones formed in an ancient lake, but the chemistry does not directly reveal the climate conditions when the sediment eroded upstream. For that, the researchers had to look for similar rocks and soils on Earth to find a correlation between the planets.The study published in The crater once contained a lake, but the climate that allowed water to fill it is the subject of a long debate. Some argue that early Mars was warm and wet, and that rivers and lakes were commonly present. Others think it was cold and dry and that glaciers and snow were more common.""Sedimentary rocks in Gale Crater instead detail a climate that likely falls in between these two scenarios,"" said Thorpe, now a Mars sample return scientist at NASA Johnson Space Center contractor Jacobs Space Exploration Group. ""The ancient climate was likely frigid but also appears to have supported liquid water in lakes for extended periods of time.""The researchers were surprised that there was so little weathering of rocks on Mars after more than 3 billion years, such that the ancient Mars rocks were comparable to Icelandic sediments in a river and lake today.""On Earth, the sedimentary rock record does a fantastic job of maturing over time with the help of chemical weathering,"" Thorpe noted. ""However, on Mars we see very young minerals in the mudstones that are older than any sedimentary rocks on Earth, suggesting weathering was limited.""The researchers directly studied sediments from Idaho and Iceland, and compiled studies of similar basaltic sediments from a range of climates around the world, from Antarctica to Hawaii, to bracket the climate conditions they thought were possible on Mars when water was flowing into Gale Crater.""Earth provided an excellent laboratory for us in this study, where we could use a range of locations to see the effects of different climate variables on weathering, and average annual temperature had the strongest effect for the types of rocks in Gale Crater,"" said Siebach, a member of the Curiosity team who will be a Perseverance operator after the new lander touches down in February. ""The range of climates on Earth allowed us to calibrate our thermometer for measuring the temperature on ancient Mars.""The makeup of sand and mud in Iceland were the closest match to Mars based on analysis via the standard chemical index of alteration (CIA), a basic geological tool used to infer past climate from chemical and physical weathering of a sample.""As water flows through rocks to erode and weather them, it dissolves the most soluble chemical components of the minerals that form the rocks,"" Siebach said. ""On Mars, we saw that only a small fraction of the elements that dissolve the fastest had been lost from the mud relative to volcanic rocks, even though the mud has the smallest grain size and is usually the most weathered.""This really limits the average annual temperature on Mars when the lake was present, because if it were warmer, then more of those elements would have been flushed away,"" she said.The results also indicated the climate shifted over time from Antarctic-like conditions to become more Icelandic while fluvial processes continued to deposit sediments in the crater. This shift shows the technique can be used to help track climate changes on ancient Mars.While the study focused on the lowest, most ancient part of the lake sediments Curiosity has explored, other studies have also indicated the Martian climate probably fluctuated and became drier with time. ""This study establishes one way to interpret that trend more quantitatively, by comparison to climates and environments we know well on Earth today,"" Siebach said. ""Similar techniques could be used by Perseverance to understand ancient climate around its landing site at Jezero Crater.""In parallel, climate change, especially in Iceland, may shift the places on Earth best-suited for understanding the past on both planets, she said.",Climate,2021.0,"Rice University scientists have compared data from NASA's Curiosity rover to places on Earth with similar geologic formations to study an ancient Martian crater.

What they learned can help fine-tune future climate predictions.,"In June 1783, Laki spewed more sulfur into the atmosphere than any other Northern Hemisphere eruption in the last 1,000 years. The Inuit in North America tell stories about the year that summer never arrived. Benjamin Franklin, who was in France at the time, noted the ""fog"" that descended over much of Europe in the aftermath, and correctly reasoned that it led to an unusually cold winter on the continent.Previous analyses of annual tree rings have shown that the entire 1783 growing season for the spruce trees in Alaska was colder than average. But Julie Edwards, a first-year doctoral student in the School of Geography, Development and Environment reasoned that since Laki erupted in June, it doesn't make sense to assume that the entire growing season, which starts in May for the trees they analyzed, was cooler than normal. So, she set out to solve the mystery.Edwards is lead author of a new paper published in the What happens to the climate a half a world away from the eruption reflects a combination of forces -- what the volcano did and the natural variability in the climate. To really understand how volcanoes affect the climate system, the UArizona team looked closely at the structure of tree rings to reveal what happened to the climate on a finer time scale.Edwards cut a very thin slice of tree ring and dyed it. Using computer software, she calculated the thickness of each of the stained cells. In warm years, the walls of these cells are thickened, and the wood appears darker. In cold years, however, the cell walls are thin, and the wood appears light and less dense.""This is quantitative wood anatomy, and what we're doing is looking at cellular scale measurements on a cell-by-cell basis to see how climate is imprinting on cell growth throughout a season,"" Edwards said. ""Using this technique, we can measure growth week by week.""With this new way of seeing climate history, the researchers found that Alaskan trees in 1783 started off growing like they would in any normal year. A few months after Laki erupted, the trees suddenly stopped growing much earlier than in normal years, and only a very thin wall was formed in the last part of the ring.""This suggests a sudden cooling at the end of the growing season, which is a different result than what you'd get by just looking at annual tree-ring width or wood density,"" said paper co-author Kevin Anchukaitis, an associate professor in the School of Geography, Development, and Environment and the Laboratory of Tree Ring Research. ""What Julie's work shows is that using this fine-scale analysis, this week-to-week perspective from individual cells, it is possible to explain the previous and unexpected observation that the entire summer of 1783 was cold in Alaska and get a much better perspective on a truly extreme climate event.""Edwards is one of only a few scientists in the United States to use the quantitative wood anatomy technique. The method has been previously used mostly in Europe, where she participated in a weeklong workshop in San Vito di Cadore, a small town in the Italian Alps, to learn the method from the people who perfected it.Edwards said it was also important for her and her collaborators to factor in natural variability in climate to check their result.Partnering with climate modeler Brian Zambri from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the team used a computer model to see how natural year-to-year variations in climate could have changed tree growth.""The model was run a total of 80 times,"" Anchukaitis said. ""The first 40 times, we allowed the eruption to occur. Then, the model was run another 40 times without the eruption, and we compared the results.""The researchers saw a wide range of climate conditions following the eruptions. Some years were especially cold immediately following the eruption, but some were warm. Natural variability in the climate seems to overwhelm any cooling from the volcano.""Many of the model runs agree with what the trees tell us,"" Anchukaitis said. ""Summer starts normally and then a few months after the eruption, things rapidly get cold. This serves as independent evidence of what we interpret from the trees in 1783.""The study demonstrates that the traditional way of studying tree rings doesn't always provide enough detail when studying rapid or extreme climate events, and also that natural variability in the system can be more important than once thought.""We use these proxy measurements of past climate, including tree rings, as one way to validate our climate models,"" Edwards said. ""We want to be able to look at these extreme scenarios and have our climate models accurately simulate them and understand the role of natural variability.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new study by the University of Arizona has shown that a volcanic eruption in Iceland in 1783 caused a sudden cooling in Alaska later that year.

Productivity fluctuations point to big changes in lake ecosystems.""The base of the food chain in these lakes is algal productivity. These lakes are oceanic in size, and are teaming with phytoplankton -- small algae,"" said co-author Gary Fahnenstiel, a fellow at MTRI and recently retired senior research scientist for NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. ""We measured the carbon fixation rate, which is the rate at which the algae photosynthesize in these lakes. As that rate changes, whether increasing or decreasing, it means the whole lake is changing, which has ramifications all the way up the food chain, from the zooplankton to the fish.""Many factors affect these lakes. Climate change, increasing nutrients (eutrophication) and invasive species all combine to wreak systemwide change -- making it difficult to pinpoint specific causes, particularly from the ground with limited on-site observations.But satellite imagery has made sorting through the noise easier and provides insights over time and space. Michael Sayers, MTRI research scientist and study lead author, uses ocean color remote sensing -- making inferences about type and quantity of phytoplankton based on the color of the water -- to track freshwater phytoplankton dynamics.""We've relied on NASA assets -- the MODIS satellite, which has been flying since 2002, to which we apply the algorithm and model we've been developing at MTRI for a decade,"" Sayers said. ""When we start to tally the numbers of pixels as observations globally for 11 lakes for 16 years, it is really quite remarkable."" The pixels observed per lake number ""in the millions,"" he added.One of the most remarkable aspects of the results is just how fast changes in these freshwater lakes have occurred -- a noticeable amount in fewer than 20 years. The research contributes to NASA's Carbon Monitoring System's goal of determining how much freshwater lakes contribute to the global carbon cycle.""Three of the largest lakes in the world are showing major changes related to climate change, with a 20-25% change in overall biological productivity in just the past 16 years,"" Fahnenstiel said.In the 16 years of data, Great Bear and Great Slave lakes in northern Canada saw the greatest increases in productivity, while Lake Tanganyika in southeastern Africa has seen decreases. The trends are linked to increases in water temperatures, as well as solar radiation and a reduction in wind speed.Sayers said looking at productivity, algal abundance, water clarity, water temperature, solar radiation and wind speeds at freshwater lakes provides a richer picture of the overall ecosystem.""Temperature and solar radiation are factors of climate change,"" Sayers said. ""Chlorophyll and water transparency changes are not necessarily caused by climate change, but could be caused by eutrophication or invasive species, like quagga mussels.""The researchers used lake measurements performed by the Great Lakes Research Center research vessel fleet to ground truth the satellite observations and to provide input for model estimates.The article ""Carbon Fixation Trends in Eleven of the World's Largest Lakes: 2003-2018"" is published in the journal As the saying goes, water is life. Gaining a better understanding of how lake productivity changes affect the bodies of water so many people rely on is important to the communities who live on the lakeshores. It's also significant to the global community as we delve deeper into the role freshwater lakes play in the global carbon cycle and climate change.Phytoplankton are microscopic algae that photosynthesize, or make energy from sunlight. Carbon fixation is a part of photosynthesis -- inorganic carbon (particularly carbon dioxide) is converted into an organic compound by an organism. All living things on Earth contain organic carbon. The amount of phytoplankton and the rate at which they photosynthesize equal the carbon fixation rate in a lake.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers at the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) have studied 11 of the world's largest lakes, including the five Laurentian Great Lakes and Lake Baikal in Russia, to understand how they are being affected by climate change and other factors.

For a realistic assessment of these effects, it is necessary to also consider previous temperature trends going far back into Earth's history. Researchers from the University of Bayreuth and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg show this in a paper for ","The research team led by Bayreuth ecologist Prof. Dr. Manuel Steinbauer used palaeobiological and climate science models to investigate how a temperature trend over a long period of time and a subsequent short-term temperature change together affect species extinction. For this purpose, research data on eight different groups of marine and terrestrial animals were combined and analysed. In total, these groups include around 3,200 genera and more than 46,000 species. One of the key findings of the study was that the extent to which short-term temperature changes affect species diversity depends largely on the context of geographic and climatic history. If a long-lasting cooling is intensified by a subsequent short-term cooling, the climate-related extinction risk of the studied genera increases by up to 40 percent. However, this risk decreases if a long-term cooling of the Earth, such as occurred 40 million years ago up to the industrial age, is followed by a short-term warming.The researchers explain the effect they discovered by the fact that every species develops adaptations to certain climatic conditions in the course of its evolution. They retain these adaptations over a period of hundreds of thousands or millions of years. A long-term cooling therefore moves the species further and further away from the living conditions that are favourable for them and increases the risk of extinction. If a brief warming now follows, the habitat of the species will again approach the preferred climate. ""Further studies are still needed to apply the results of our now published work to climate change as we are currently experiencing it. However, it seems very possible that human-induced global warming that began with the industrial age does not threaten global biodiversity as much as some predictions assume,"" explains Gregor Mathes M.Sc., first author of the study, who is currently writing a doctoral thesis in palaeobiology at the Universities of Bayreuth and Erlangen-Nuremberg.""In the next two years, we wish to investigate even more closely the extent to which current forecasts of climate-induced species loss should be adjusted given that they ignore the context of geographic and climatic history. In the current biodiversity crisis, climate change is only one of many causes of species extinction.

Shraddhanand Shukla and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara's Climate Hazards Center, present these findings in the open-access journal ","Climate-driven seasonal drought can impact crop yields and is among major contributors to food insecurity, which can threaten people's lives and livelihoods. In the last five years, parts of Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced a significant rise in food insecurity, sometimes requiring emergency food assistance. Early warning systems that reliably predict conditions likely to lead to food insecurity could help drive timely actions to mitigate these effects.Shukla and colleagues hypothesized that the onset date of the rainy season, as calculated from precipitation data, could serve as such a warning. To explore this possibility, they analyzed the relationship between the onset date, drought conditions observed via satellite images of vegetation cover, and the risks of food insecurity based on quarterly reports on food insecurity in across Sub-Saharan Africa from April 2011 through February 2020.The analysis showed that a delay of about 10 days from the median date of onset of the rainy season was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of seasonal drought in regions with the highest risk of acutesevere food insecurity.

Indeed, the research suggests that methane gas emissions from AOG wells are currently the 10th and 11th largest sources of anthropogenic methane emission in the US and Canada, respectively. Since methane gas is a more important contributor to global warming than carbon dioxide, especially over the short term, the researchers believe that it is essential to gain a clearer understanding of methane emissions from AOG wells to understand their broader environmental impacts and move towards mitigating the problem.","The researchers show that the difficulties in estimating overall methane emissions from AOG wells in both countries are due to a lack of information about both the quantities of methane gas being emitted annually from AOG wells (depending on whether and how well they have been capped), and about the number of AOG wells themselves.""Oil and gas development started in the late 1850s both in Canada and the US,"" explains Mary Kang, the senior author on the paper and an assistant professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at McGill. ""Many companies that dug wells have come and gone since then, so it can be hard to find records of the wells that once existed.""To determine the number of AOG wells, the researchers analyzed information from 47 state, provincial or territorial databases as well as from research articles and national repositories of drilled and active wells in the US and Canada.They found that, of the over 4,000,000 AOG wells they estimate to exist in the US, more than 500,000 are undocumented by the relevant state agencies. A similar picture emerges in Canada. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) only has records going back to 1955 although historical documents confirm that oil and gas activity in Canada began in the 1850s. Based on the various sources they examined, the researchers estimate that there are over 370,000 AOG wells in Canada. Over 60,000 of are not included in databases of provincial or territorial agencies.To gain a better sense of exactly how much methane was being emitted from the wells, the researchers analyzed close to 600 direct measurements of methane emissions drawn from existing studies covering the AOG wells in the states of Ohio, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Pennsylvania in the US and from British Columbia and New Brunswick in Canada. They developed different scenarios to attribute different levels of annual methane emissions to the wells, depending on what is known of the plugging status of the wells as well as whether they were oil or gas wells.""We see that methane emissions from abandoned wells can vary regionally, highlighting the importance of gathering measurements from Texas and Alberta which have the highest percentage of wells in the U.S. and Canada and no prior measurements,"" adds James P. Williams, the first author on the study and a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at McGill.All five scenarios show annual emissions of methane gas from AOG wells in the US that are approximately 1/5th higher than the amount that the US EPA's estimates for 2018.

These results were coded to allow comparison -- with over half the studies analysed ""blind"" by different researchers to avoid bias.The ten policy ""instruments"" covered in the study include forms of investment -- targeted R&D funding, for example -- as well as financial incentives including different kinds of subsidies, taxes, and the auctioning of energy contracts.The policies also include market interventions -- e.g. emissions permits; tradable certificates for clean or saved energy -- and efficiency standards, such as those for buildings.Researchers looked at whether each policy type had a positive or negative effect in various environmental, industrial and socio-economic areas.When it came to ""distributional consequences"" -- the fairness with which the costs and benefits are spread -- the mass of evidence suggests that the impact of five of the ten policy types are far more negative than positive.""Small firms and average households have less capacity to absorb increases in energy costs,"" said co-author Laura Diaz Anadon, Professor of Climate Change Policy.""Some of the investment and regulatory policies made it harder for small and medium-size firms to participate in new opportunities or adjust to changes.""If policies are not well designed and vulnerable households and businesses experience them negatively, it could increase public resistance to change -- a major obstacle in reaching net zero carbon,"" said Anadon.For example, feed-in tariffs pay renewable electricity producers above market rates. But these costs may bump energy prices for all if they get passed on to households -- leaving the less well-off spending a larger portion of their income on energy.Renewable electricity traded as 'green certificates' can redistribute wealth from consumers to energy companies -- with 83% of the available evidence suggesting they have a ""negative impact,"" along with 63% of the evidence for energy taxes, which can disproportionately affect rural areas.However, the vast tranche of data assembled by the researchers reveals how many of these policies can be designed and aligned to complement each other, boost innovation, and pave the way for a fairer transition to zero carbon.For example, tailoring feed-in tariffs (FiTs) to be ""predictable yet adjustable"" can benefit smaller and more dispersed clean energy projects -- improving market competitiveness and helping to mitigate local NIMBYism*.Moreover, revenues from environmental taxes could go towards social benefits or tax credits e.g. reducing corporate tax for small firms and lowering income taxes, providing what researchers call a ""double dividend"": stimulating economies while reducing emissions.The researchers argue that creating a ""balance"" of well-designed and complementary policies can benefit different renewable energy producers and ""clean"" technologies at various stages.Government funding for research and development (R&D) that targets small firms can help attract other funding streams -- boosting both eco-innovation and competitiveness. When combined with R&D tax credits, it predominantly supports innovation in startups rather than corporations.Government procurement, using tiered contracts and bidding, can also improve innovation and market access for smaller businesses in ""economically stressed"" areas. This could aid the ""levelling up"" between richer and poorer regions as part of any green recovery.""There is no one-size-fits-all solution,"" said Peñasco. ""Policymakers should deploy incentives for innovation, such as targeted R&D funding, while also adapting tariffs and quotas to benefit those across income distributions.""We need to spur the development of green technology at the same time as achieving public buy-in for the energy transition that must start now to prevent catastrophic global heating,"" she said.",Climate,2021.0,"A study by the University of Cambridge has found that low-carbon policies must be designed to benefit local firms and lower-income families in order to achieve 'Net Zero' carbon and a green recovery.

Through ocean and atmosphere interactions, El Niño (Spanish for The Christ Child) events cause significant warming of the eastern Pacific, accompanied by catastrophic rainfall over South America and droughts in the Indo-Pacific region. Powerful events have global effects that reach even into the extra-tropics. There is also an El Niño variant in the Atlantic, called the Atlantic Niño, which, for example, has effects on rainfall in West Africa as well as the development of tropical cyclones over the eastern tropical Atlantic. A better understanding of the poorly investigated little brother of the Pacific El Niño in the Atlantic could potentially improve climate forecasts in the region. The study now provides first results and suggests useful predictability of the Atlantic Niño.","""The Atlantic Niño, like its Pacific counterpart, exhibits a characteristic asymmetric structure in the changes of sea surface temperatures and surface winds from east to west, with the strongest warming occurring in the east.

Although the ACG's protected status has effectively eliminated certain threats to biodiversity loss, such as fire, hunting, deforestation, and pesticide use, the creatures that dwell there are not exempt from what Janzen and Hallwachs call the ""heterogenous blanket"" of climate change effects.""What we have seen and lived since the mid-1970s, unambiguously, in our Costa Rican tropical wild world is that the biomass and species richness of insect individuals and species, and their interactions with everything, are decomposing,"" they write.To respond to this decline, the scientists have focused their efforts locally. Keeping track of the effects of climate change through consistent monitoring is essential, they say, but what even more critical is engaging the people who own the preserved land: all five million Costa Ricans, in this case. Janzen and Hallwachs are internationally known for their work on this front, having created a model in ACG that empowers and employs local people in conservation work and attempts to facilitate the movement of these processes throughout the national park system and abroad.In their article, the researchers describe a new approach to expand on these successes: BioAlfa, a nationwide program designed to enlist Costa Ricans themselves in hands-on learning and research about their nation's wild ecosystems. The initiative's name comes from the Spanish for bioliterate, ""bioalfabetizado.""""The tradition in tropical countries is that when you want to know something about the biology of your country, expeditions from the North come and do studies of one sort or another and then they take the information home with them,"" Janzen and Hallwachs say. ""What we said is, 'Look, you're capable of doing this all yourselves. You can find all the bugs and the plants and the birds and everything in your own country and, in the process, learn about them.'""Janzen and Hallwachs never intended to explicitly study climate change. But its effects have been impossible to ignore. They note that in the 1980s cloud cover was a constant presence over the aptly named cloud forests of ACG, shrouding peaks like Volcán Orosí and Volcán Cacao. Yet the cloud layer shrank by the 1990s and now,many days pass with no cloud cover whatsoever. The result is a drying of forest ecosystems to the detriment of insects and other wildlife that thrive in damp leaf litter and moist conditions, to say nothing of the drying waterways that used to adequately irrigate flatland crops and other development.The ACG now experiences far more days of temperatures that approach and exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit than it did in past decades. In addition, a prolonged dry season and greater irregularities in rainfall amount and timing compound the stresses on the biodiversity that lives there. Essentially all tropical organisms use weather cues to guide their lives, and when these change and fracture everyone takes a hit.Janzen and Hallwachs note that these climatic perturbations have extracted a price on insect biodiversity, a bellwether for impacts on the food web bottom to top. In their report, they compare photos from moth surveys -- conducted at night by using a bright light to attract moths to a light-colored sheet, where they can be counted -- that indicate a dramatic drop in both moth numbers and species diversity since the 1980s.Looking at a different types of insects, they say that, despite a constant search effort by ACG's on-the-ground staff of trained and experienced neighbor researchers, the overall number of caterpillars found during regular surveys has fallen in half since 2005, a clear sign of decline.Supporting this finding, when caterpillars are found, they are now less likely to be parasitized by another insect species. About a fifth of caterpillars were found parasitized in 1985; that has fallen to just 5% in recent years. While this may be a good thing for individual caterpillars, it's a worrying sign overall. Because parasites are hyperspecialized to associate with particular caterpillar species, Janzen says that this lack of parasitized caterpillars suggests that caterpillar numbers are so few that the parasites are unable to locate their desired species and maintain their populations.""When caterpillar density goes down, the parasites go extinct faster,"" Janzen says. ""So now you've lost that carnivore. And you repeat that a thousand times, 10,000 times.""Mitigating climate change can be an overwhelming task, and Janzen says that ""little guys"" -- like the economically-small but biodiversity-big country of Costa Rica -- are unlikely to make a big-picture impact, except by example. In his eyes, it's essential for small tropical nations to focus energy on creating the conditions that enable the survivors of climate change to maintain a foothold. And that is where BioAlfa comes in.While international conservation groups contribute money to preserve land in lush, biodiverse locales, such as ACG, the researchers argue that gaining buy-in from all levels of the owners of that preserved land, rather than outsiders who may never step foot in the country, is a necessary ingredient in tropical conservation.""Charismatic vertebrates, tourist snapshots, and marketable big tree trunks are not even 0.001% of tropical biodiversity,"" Janzen and Hallwachs write. ""The millions to billions of species, and billions of wild interactions still viable, are largely invisible without bioliteracy.""That's why underscoring bioliteracy is the foundation of BioAlfa. The Penn scientists' vision is that, just as elementary school children are taught to read, they should also be taught about the biodiversity around them, and not just in a classroom but by going on the land and learning by doing. And like reading, this knowledge becomes something one takes into whatever social sector becomes home.This enhanced bioliteracy would then feed back into conservation, they say. Not only might a greater understanding of ecosystems among Costa Ricans translate into greater appreciation but concrete results by using biodiversity information wherever they are. Specifically, Janzen and Hallwachs want to expand the practice of having local researchers carry out their DNA barcoding work, in which species are identified by sequencing stretches of their genetic material.While the Costa Rican government has committed to the idea of BioAlfa, fully fleshing it out over 10 years will take an estimated $100 million, a hefty sum that Janzen and Hallwachs hope can come from both international governmental and private sources.""Right now Costa Rica has the political permission for this project, but it also needs the financial permission,"" says Janzen.For their part, the couple continues to plug away at building their biodiversity inventory and studies in ACG, while sharing their successes at international meetings (for now virtually), hoping that other tropical nations will follow in their footsteps, protecting land to, in the words of their scientific paper, ""be kind to the survivors"" of climate change.As soon as they're vaccinated for the coronavirus, Janzen and Hallwachs plan to be back on the ground in Costa Rica, continuing to pursue that goal.Daniel Janzen is professor of biology and Thomas G. and Louise E.

Ants? Fish? No, and not humans either. The answer is nematodes, also known as roundworms. Four out of five animals on earth belong to this group, and the reason hardly anyone is aware of the fact is that they live underground, invisible to us. Together with thousands of other soil organisms, they quietly, discreetly and constantly perform enormously important services for the world above them.","The soil is one of the most species-rich habitats in existence. Living under one square meter of healthy soil you can find up to 1.5 kilograms of organisms: among others, roundworms, earthworms, springtails, mites and insect larvae. There is also a multitude of microorganisms including bacteria, protists and fungi. They eat and transform living and dead animal and plant material into nutrients which become the basis for growth and new life. Without soil organisms, no plants would be able to grow and no humans could live.It is therefore all the more astonishing that soils have so far hardly featured in international strategies for protecting biodiversity. The authors of the new article in Healthy soils are becoming increasingly rare. They suffer the burden of intensive cultivation with heavy machinery, fertilisers and pesticides, are compacted, built over or are lost due to wind and water erosion. Global warming is putting them under additional pressure. According to the German Heinrich Böll Foundation, around 24 billion tons of fertile soil are lost worldwide every year. As a result, the soils' wide variety of services such as water purification and protection against plant diseases gradually decline. In addition, soils are the most important carbon reservoir on earth and therefore help slow global climate warming.According to the researchers, these services are given far too little attention in the political debate. ""Up to now, soil conservation has been mostly reduced to the impacts related to soil erosion and its importance for agriculture,"" said first author Dr Carlos Guerra (iDiv, MLU). ""It's about time that soil conservation policies consider the protection of soil organisms and ecosystem functions more than just for food production and other productive systems. Soil biodiversity monitoring and conservation can support the achievement and tracking of many sustainability goals, targeting areas such as climate, food and biodiversity protection.""""Protection measures have so far mainly focused on life above ground, for example in the designation of protected areas,"" said senior author Dr Diana Wall from Colorado State University. However, since these do not necessarily benefit underground biodiversity, the specific needs of the biotic communities in the soil have to be taken into account.In order to be able to decide which regions of the world are particularly in need of protection, and which protective measures are appropriate, sufficient information must be available on the status and trends of biodiversity in soils. Since this has not been the case so far, the researchers launched the Soil BON monitoring network. ""We want to move biodiversity in soils into the focus of conservation efforts. To do this, we must provide policymakers with the necessary information to support decision-making,"" said senior author Prof Nico Eisenhauer, research group leader at iDiv and Leipzig University. ""Soil BON will produce and support the production of the relevant data to achieve this goal.""The purpose of Soil BON is to help gather equivalent soil data, comprehensively and over extended periods of time. What is required is an internationally recognised standard which sets out what is to be recorded and how. The researchers propose a holistic system for this: the so-called Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs). EBVs are key parameters for measuring biodiversity. The concept was developed by, among others, iDiv and includes criteria such as soil respiration, nutrient turnover and genetic diversity. Indicators are derived from the EBVs which then serve as a basis for soil status evaluation and subsequent decisions regarding the level and type of protection necessary for the soils.According to the researchers, their proposed monitoring and indicator system will enable the worldwide condition of soils and their capacity to function to be recorded efficiently and monitored long term. They emphasise that it also serves as an important early warning system; with its help, it will be possible to identify, at an early stage, whether existing nature conservation goals can be achieved with current measures.",Climate,2021.0,"Soil is a vital habitat for a diverse range of organisms, including microorganisms, insects, and worms.

Soil conservation policies need to consider the protection of soil organisms and ecosystem functions beyond food production and other productive systems.

The global sea level would rise an estimated 20 feet if the thick ice sheet melted.With climate change, sea-level rise and coastal storms threaten low-lying islands, cities and lands around the world.Most scientists ignore sediment in glacial streams that form on top of the Greenland ice sheet as meltwater flows to the ocean, but the Rutgers-led team wanted to find out why they accumulated so much sediment. In 2017, scientists flew drones over an approximately 425-foot-long stream in southwest Greenland, took measurements and collected sediment samples. They found that sediment covers up to a quarter of the stream bottom, far more than the estimated 1.2 percent that would exist if organic matter and cyanobacteria did not cause sediment granules to clump together. They also showed that streams have more sediment than predicted by hydrological models.""We found that the only way for sediment to accumulate in these streams was if bacteria grew in the sediment, causing it to clump into balls 91 times their original size,"" Leidman said. ""If bacteria didn't grow in the sediment, all the sediment would be washed away and these streams would absorb significantly less sunlight. This sediment aggregation process has been going on for longer than human history.""The solar energy absorbed by streams likely depends on the health and longevity of the bacteria, and further warming in Greenland may lead to greater sediment deposits in glacial streams, the study says.""Decreases in cloud cover and increases in temperature in Greenland are likely causing these bacteria to grow more extensively, causing more sediment-driven melting,"" Leidman said. ""With climate change causing more of the ice sheet to be covered by streams, this feedback may lead to an increase in Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise. By incorporating this process into climate models, we'll be able to more accurately predict how much melting will occur, with the caveat that it is uncertain how much more melting will take place compared with what climate models predict. It will likely not be negligible.""",Climate,2021.0,"Microbes are causing sediment to clump together in meltwater streams on the Greenland ice sheet, according to a study led by Rutgers University.

The team applied this classification to 104 climate adaptation projects funded by the WCS Climate Adaptation Fund over the past decade and found differential responses toward transformation over time and across ecosystems, with more transformative actions applied in forested ecosystems.","The RRT classification addresses a continuum from actively resisting changes -- in order to maintain current or historical conditions -- through accelerating ecological transitions through approaches such as translocating species to new areas. Results show a shift from more resistance-type actions to transformative ones in recent years. Most transformation-oriented projects involved translocation of trees or other plants, commonly in forest ecosystems, with exceptions including, for example, translocating seabird species to habitat where they may be more likely to survive. Other ecosystems with more transformative projects occurred in coastal aquatic and urban/suburban ecosystems.Unprecedented environmental changes such as increased frequency and severity of heatwaves, droughts, storms, heavy rainfalls, and wildfires, have degraded ecosystems, disturbed the economy, and led to the loss of lives and livelihoods. Conventional conservation strategies may be ineffective in dealing with changing environmental conditions: wildfires could decimate protected old-growth forests and endangered species, and coastal conservation easements could become inundated by rising seas. Novel conservation actions aimed specifically at helping ecosystems adapt to the mounting impacts of climate change contrast with approaches that aim to maintain current or historical conditions. Transformative actions, such as species translocation, were once more controversial than they are today; they are now increasingly highlighted as necessary components of conservation in an effort to implement projects that are more robust to future climates. However, few studies have systematically examined on-the-ground conservation adaptation projects to assess the extent to which such transformational adaptation actions are being implemented, through what approaches, and in what ecosystems.This study, published in The interdisciplinary research team was supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, and the study was conducted in partnership with the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Climate Change Specialist Group.Precautionary actions aimed at resistance or resilience -- such as protecting intact ecosystems -- are incredibly valuable in the suite of responses needed to address current and future climate change.

It is believed to be the first study across multiple nations and continents of how both higher temperatures and rainfall -- two key results of climate change -- have impacted children's diet diversity.""Certainly, future climate changes have been predicted to affect malnutrition, but it surprised us that higher temperatures are already showing an impact,"" said lead author Meredith Niles, an assistant professor of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Vermont and a fellow at the university's Gund Institute for Environment.Led by University of Vermont researchers, the study examines diet diversity among 107,000 children 5 and under in 19 countries in Asia, Africa, and South America, using 30 years of geo-coded temperature and precipitation data, and socioeconomic, ecological, and geographic data.The study finds that the negative effects of climate -- especially higher temperature -- on diet diversity are greater in some regions than the positive effects of education, water and sanitation and poverty alleviation -- all common global development tactics. The findings were published today in Of the six regions examined -- Asia; Central and South America; North, West, and Southeast Africa, five had significant reductions in diet diversity associated with higher temperatures.Researchers focused on diet diversity, a metric developed by the United Nations to measure diet quality and micronutrient intake. Micronutrients, such as iron, folic acid, zinc, and vitamins A and D, are critical for child development. A lack of micronutrients is a cause of malnutrition, which affects one out of every three children under the age of five. Diet diversity is measured by counting the number of food groups eaten over a given time period.On average, children in the study had eaten food from 3.2 food groups (out of 10) -- including meat and fish, legumes, dark leafy greens and cereal greens -- in the previous 24 hours. By contrast, diet diversity in emerging economies or more affluent countries such as China have been more than double this average (6.8 for children 6 and under).""Diet diversity was already low for this group,"" said UVM co-author Brendan Fisher. ""These results suggest that, if we don't adapt, climate change could further erode a diet that already isn't meeting adequate child micronutrient levels.""Severe childhood malnutrition is a significant global challenge. According to the United Nations, 144 million children under age 5 were affected by stunting in 2019, an effect of chronic malnutrition. In 2019, 47 million children under 5 suffered from wasting, or acute undernutrition the UN says, a condition caused by limited nutrient intake and infection.The study also found that higher precipitation, another potential effect of climate change in some regions, was associated with higher child diet diversity. In some cases, the effect of higher precipitation had a greater impact on child diet diversity than education, improved sanitation or greater forest cover.""Higher rainfall in the future may provide important diet quality benefits in multiple ways, but it also depends on how that rain comes,"" said co-author Molly Brown of the University of Maryland. ""If it's more erratic and intense, as is predicted with climate change, this may not hold true.""The study builds on UVM global research into how nature improves both children's health, their diets, and human well-being. The findings suggest that, in addition to addressing current needs, policy makers need to plan for improving diets across the most vulnerable in the future with a warming climate in mind.""A warming climate has the potential undermine all the good that international development programs provide,"" said co-author Taylor Ricketts, Director of UVM's Gund Institute for Environment.

A new study led by National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) researchers revealed that this warming record could not happen without human-induced climate changes.,"The northwestern Pacific sea surface becomes warm seasonally around August every year. However, it was unprecedentedly high in August 2020, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The extremely high SSTs exceeding 30°C, which lasted until mid-September, may have intensified tropical cyclones such as Typhoon Haisheng, causing severe damages to the East Asian countries. Although human-induced greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide have gradually warmed the northwestern Pacific Ocean since the mid-20th century, it remains unclear yet how much past human activities may increase the occurrence likelihood of such regional record-warm SSTs.""Understanding the tropical warm water expansion in the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is essential for projecting changes in the characteristics of tropical cyclones and other weather events in the future,"" said Hideo Shiogama, a co-author and the head of Climate Risk Assessment Section at the Center for Global Environmental Research, NIES. ""A quantitative evaluation of what drives regional extreme temperatures happening recently is necessary to take appropriate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts of global warming.""The paper published in ""The numerical climate model ensembles are powerful tools to quantitatively distinguish between natural variability of the Earth system and climate changes caused by human activities,"" said corresponding lead author Michiya Hayashi, a research associate at NIES. The ensemble of 31 climate models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) consists of a series of historical experiments and future scenario experiments forced by greenhouse gas- and aerosol emissions from human activities and natural volcanic and solar variations from 1850 to 2100. ""We can compare the historical and future experiments with a sub-ensemble of the CMIP6 climate models forced only by the natural volcanic and solar activities to estimate to what extent human-caused climate changes have altered the northwestern Pacific Ocean condition until today.""""The northwestern Pacific warming has proceeded clearly since the 1980s,"" stated Shiogama. ""The warming speed has been accelerated in the last four decades as the reduced aerosol emissions do not cancel the warming signal forced by increasing greenhouse gas concentration anymore."" The results show that the CMIP6 ensemble well reproduces the observed long-term change in the northwestern Pacific August SST within the range of 'once-in-20-year' events in the historical simulations. ""The SSTs that exceed the pre-industrial range are rarely observed during the 20th century but have occurred frequently since 2010, indicating that human influences on the northwestern Pacific Ocean are already detectable in observations,"" noted a co-author Seita Emori, deputy director of the Center for Global Environmental Research at NIES.This new study estimates that the occurrence frequency of high northwestern Pacific SSTs exceeding the August 2020 level has been increased from once-in-600 years in the 20th century (1901-2000) to once-in-15 years in the present climate (2001-2020) using the CMIP6 ensemble. On the other hand, in the sub-ensemble forced only by natural volcanic and solar activities, the frequency for 2001-2020 is estimated to be once-in-1000 years or less. ""The record high level of the northwestern Pacific SST in August could have occurred approximately once per 15 years in 2001-2020, as observed, but it never likely occurred without human-induced greenhouse gases or in the 20th century,"" said Hayashi.Importantly, the scientists also imply from the future scenario experiments that the 2020 record high SST is becoming a new normal climate condition in August at the northwestern Pacific region by 2031-2050 when the globally averaged air temperature relative to pre-industrial levels would exceed 1.5°C. In this case, the tropical warm sea surface water, exceeding 28°C, may reach Japan, the Korean Peninsula, the west coast of India, the east coast of the U.S. mainland, and the west of the Hawaiian Islands. ""We might need to prepare for living with such warm ocean conditions even if we humans could achieve the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement,"" said Hayashi.""The human-induced ocean warming may have impacted tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and marine life from the past to present and will continue in the future unless tremendous mitigation measures would be implemented,"" added Emori.

The islands are renowned for their unique wealth of endemic species, which inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and today underpins one of the largest UNESCO World Heritage Sites and Marine Reserves on Earth.Scientists have known for decades that the regional ecosystem is sustained by upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich deep waters, which fuel the growth of the phytoplankton upon which the entire ecosystem thrives.Yet despite its critical life-supporting role, the upwelling's controlling factors had remained undetermined prior to this new study. Establishing these controls, and their climate sensitivity, is critical to assessing the resilience of the regional ecosystem against modern climatic change.In this new research, published in This model showed that the intensity of upwelling around the Galápagos is driven by local northward winds, which generate vigorous turbulence at upper-ocean fronts to the west of the islands. These fronts are areas of sharp lateral contrasts in ocean temperature, similar in character to atmospheric fronts in weather maps, but much smaller.The turbulence drives upwelling of deep waters toward the ocean surface, thus providing the nutrients needed to sustain the Galápagos ecosystem.Alex Forryan of the University of Southampton, who performed the research, said: ""Our findings show that Galápagos upwelling is controlled by highly localised atmosphere-ocean interactions. There now needs to be a focus on these processes when monitoring how the islands' ecosystem is changing, and in mitigating the ecosystem's vulnerability to 21st -century climate change.""Professor Alberto Naveira Garabato, also of the University of Southampton, who led the project supporting the research, said: ""This new knowledge of where and how the injection of deep-ocean nutrients to the Galapagos ecosystem happens is informing ongoing plans to expand the Galápagos Marine Reserve, and improve its management against the mounting pressures of climate change and human exploitation.""",Climate,2021.0,"The Galápagos archipelago, known for its unique endemic species, is sustained by upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich deep waters.

Even the best Earth Systems Models fail to predict how carbon stored by tropical forests varies from place to place. The,"She worked with Kristina Anderson-Teixeira, also a STRI staff scientist at STRI's Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory (Smithsonian ForestGEO), post-doctoral fellows from Columbia University and Princeton University, and two STRI interns to sift through dozens of studies to synthesize patterns of how tropical forest productivity and carbon storage varies across the globe. They conclude that warm, wet tropical forests with moderately fertile soils store more carbon.""Ecologists have been studying tropical forests for over a hundred years,"" said Muller-Landau, ""but most studies focus on a single forest type or a single region, making it hard to see the big picture of how carbon flows through forests. We lacked a synthesis of how tropical forests vary with climate, soils, and disturbance regime, and of what we know about the mechanisms underlying this variation.""The authors gathered studies from tropical forests around the world that measured variables such as carbon stocks, forest productivity and carbon residence time in eight or more sites differing in temperature, precipitation, elevation, and/or soil fertility. STRI interns Eva Arroyo and Bogumila Backiel contributed to the literature review and analyses.KC Cushman, a post-doctoral fellow with funding from the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments-Tropics, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research determined the geographical location of each study and obtained climate information for every site from the global CHELSA climate datasets so the team could evaluate the ranges of climate variables for all of the studies.""One of the challenges is that the older studies don't estimate carbon or report results in terms of carbon,"" Cushman said. ""But they often report other quantities that are reasonably good proxies; for example, canopy height is a good predictor of forest carbon stocks.""Some big take-away's emerged: In wet tropical forests, trees grow faster and store more carbon than in drier forests. Low elevation forests are taller and store more carbon than high elevation forests.And when soils are more fertile, trees are more productive, which would, all else being equal, be expected to lead to higher carbon stocks. But when soils are more fertile, trees also die faster, which, on its own, would lead to decreasing carbon stocks with higher fertility. But putting those two things together, carbon stocks should be greatest at intermediate fertility, which would explain why previous studies do not agree upon whether carbon stocks increase or decrease with soil fertility.Another big takeaway is that little is known about tree mortality, even though it is essential for predicting carbon stocks. In areas where the forest is disturbed more often, or tree mortality is higher for other reasons, less carbon is stored as biomass, and it flows through the system faster.Although the patterns of carbon storage in tropical forests differ from place to place, the general patterns are surprisingly consistent. African and Asian tropical forests have higher biomass in areas where the climate is similar to that in American forests, for example. Certainly, there are important exceptions to the rules-for example, some high-elevation forests are very high in biomass. But the exceptions help researchers to identify the general mechanisms underlying these patterns.As she began the review, Muller-Landau consulted former STRI staff scientist Egbert Leigh's classic text Tropical Forest Ecology, for a summary of general understanding before her synthesis. Leigh noted that dry forests (those with dry seasons of 5 or more months) had lower productivity and biomass, but considered all other lowland forests, including those with shorter dry seasons as well as ever-wet forests, to have similar leaf productivity, mortality and biomass. Her new synthesis shows that, in fact, there is a lot of variation among these forests, and that this variation is structured by climate and soils, with broadly consistent relationships across regions.""This synthesis enormously widens our sense of how above-ground carbon stocks vary with climate and soil fertility,"" Leigh said when asked to comment, ""and makes it much easier to ask questions about the causes of these relationships.""",Climate,2021.0,"A team of scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) has found that warm, wet tropical forests with moderately fertile soils store more carbon.

A recent study at Walla Walla University, by a collaboration of researchers from Walla Walla University and La Sierra University, examined the effects of acidic water on octopuses, potentially bringing new insight into both how our activities impact the world around us, and the way that world is adapting in response.","The study, ""Impact of Short- and Long-Term Exposure to Elevated Seawater PCOInitial work in the field focused on the negative effects of ocean acidity: the impaired growth of affected species such as hermit crabs, for example, or reduced survival rates of certain types of fish over time. Adaptability, however, has not received as much attention, particularly when it comes to octopuses and other cephalopods. What studies have been conducted showed conflicting results, particularly when it comes to short-term vs. long-term exposure to increased ocean acidity (OA).For instance, studies on cuttlefish show no significant change in their metabolism after exposure to increased OA, while squid subjected to the same conditions showed a reduction in aerobic metabolism, indicating reduced oxygen circulation in the subjects.For purposes of this experiment, researchers used octopus rubescens a small and easily maintained species of octopus common to the west coast of North America. The subjects were exposed to increased COMetabolic rates are very telling in such circumstances because most significant physiological changes -- such as smaller organs or reduced growth -- are reflected in the shift in metabolism. (Changes in physiology are essentially changes in energy use, which can be observed by monitoring metabolism.)The results demonstrated a surprising amount of adaptability in the subjects, as well as possible causes for data variation in other experiments. The subjects experienced high levels of metabolic change within the first 24 hours of exposure to increased acidity: a departure from earlier studies on different cephalopods, which showed a decrease in metabolic change.However, when the same subjects were evaluated after one week, their RMR had returned to normal. The normal readings remained after 5 weeks as well, though their ability to function in low oxygen levels suffered in response to the increased acidity.The results suggest that octopuses may be better able to withstand changes in ocean-acidity levels, which may have long-term bearings on our understanding of climate change. It also marks the first study to compare long-term and short-term effects of increased acid exposure. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism driving the change in RMR, but the experimental parameters -- and the use of octopus rubescens as test subjects -- provide an excellent model system for studying the effects of OA on cephalopods.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study has shown that octopuses may be more adaptable to changes in ocean acidity levels than previously thought.

The results of this research effort were recently published in ","Autonomous robotic fleets enable researchers to observe complex systems in ways that are otherwise impossible with purely ship-based or remote sensing techniques. In a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is reducing opportunities for researchers to go to sea, autonomous fleets offer an effective way to maintain a persistent presence in features of interest.Oceanic microbes are essential players in the global climate system, producing roughly half of the world's oxygen, removing carbon dioxide, and forming the base of the marine food web. Open-ocean eddies can be over 100 kilometers (62 miles) across and last for months. Phytoplankton (a kind of microscopic algae) thrive when these eddies spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and bring nutrient-rich water from the depths up toward the surface.""The research challenge facing our interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers was to figure out a way to enable a team of robots -- communicating with us and each other -- to track and sample the DCM,"" said Brett Hobson, a senior mechanical engineer at MBARI and a coauthor of this study. Researchers have struggled to study the DCM because at depths of more than 100 meters (328 feet), it can't be tracked with remote sensing from satellites. Moreover, the position of the DCM can shift more than 30 meters (98 feet) vertically in just a few hours. This variability in time and space requires technology that can embed itself in and around the DCM and follow the microbial community as it drifts in the ocean currents.Ed DeLong and David Karl, oceanography professors in the UH M?noa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) and co-authors of the study, have been researching these microbes for decades. DeLong noted that these teams of coordinated robotic vehicles offer a vital step toward autonomous and adaptive sampling of oceanographic features. ""Open-ocean eddies can have a huge impact on microbes, but until now we haven't been able to observe them in this moving frame of reference,"" he explained.During the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (SCOPE) Eddy Experiment in March and April 2018, researchers used satellite imaging to locate an eddy north of the Hawaiian Islands. They deployed a hi-tech team of three robots -- two long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) and one Wave Glider surface vehicle -- from the Schmidt Ocean Institute's (SOI) research vessel Falkor.The first LRAUV (named Aku) acted as the primary sampling robot. It was programmed to locate, track, and sample the DCM. Using an onboard 3rd-Generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G-ESP), Aku filtered and preserved seawater samples, allowing researchers to capture a series of snapshots of the organisms' genetic material and proteins.The second LRAUV (named Opah) acoustically tracked Aku and spiraled vertically around it to collect crucial information about the environment surrounding the DCM. LRAUVs Aku and Opah carried a suite of sensors to measure temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll concentrations, optical backscatter, and photosynthetically active radiation. Aku remained submerged for several days at a time sampling the DCM, while Opah surfaced every few hours to relay information via satellite back to scientists on the ship. A Wave Glider surface robot (named Mola) also tracked Aku with sonar and communicated with the science team aboard the Falkor.""This work is really the fulfillment of a decades-long vision,"" said MBARI President and CEO Chris Scholin. Scholin has been engaged in this effort since he was an MBARI postdoctoral researcher seeking to develop autonomous sampling technology for marine systems. ""Coordinating a robotic fleet to show how microbial communities react to changing conditions is a game-changer when it comes to oceanographic research.""The researchers determined that Aku accurately and consistently tracked the DCM over the course of its multi-day sampling missions. By tracking the temperature corresponding to the peak of chlorophyll (an indicator of phytoplankton) in the DCM, the LRAUV maintained its position within the DCM even as this biological feature moved as much as 36 meters (118 feet) vertically in four hours.""Building an LRAUV with an integrated ESP that could track this feature was a milestone. Combining that sampling power with the agility of three different robots autonomously working together over the course of the experiment is a significant engineering and operations achievement,"" said Yanwu Zhang, a senior research engineer at MBARI and the lead author of this study.Beyond the extraordinary engineering feat of organizing this robot ballet, the study also offers key takeaways related to how the biological community behaves inside a swirling eddy. RNA measurements reveal that as the eddy weakened into the second leg of the experiment, the phytoplankton biomass in the DCM decreased. ""Much like our own team of researchers, each of the robots in the fleet is a specialist contributing to the experiment,"" said John Ryan, a senior research specialist at MBARI and a coauthor of the study. ""This adaptive approach gives us a new perspective on the environmental processes going on inside and around this plankton community.""These robotic fleets are now also being used to monitor other key disturbances to ocean health like harmful algal blooms and oil spills. ""Given the rapid changes our ocean is undergoing as a result of human activities such as climate change, pollution and overfishing, this technology has the potential to transform our ability to understand and predict ocean health,"" said Scholin.This research is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Simons Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the State of Hawai'i.",Climate,2021.0,"Autonomous robotic fleets are helping researchers to observe complex oceanic systems in ways that were previously impossible.

While temperature thresholds for photosynthesis and respiration have been studied in the lab, the Fluxnet data provide a window into what ecosystems across Earth are actually experiencing and how they are responding.""We know that the temperature optima for humans lie around 37 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit), but we in the scientific community didn't know what those optima were for the terrestrial biosphere,"" Duffy said.She teamed up with researchers at Woodwell Climate and the University of Waikato who recently developed a new approach to answer that question: MacroMolecular Rate Theory (MMRT). With its basis in the principles of thermodynamics, MMRT allowed the researchers to generate temperature curves for every major biome and the globe.The results were alarming.The researchers found that temperature ""peaks"" for carbon uptake -- 18 degrees C for the more widespread C3 plants and 28 degrees C for C4 plants -- are already being exceeded in nature, but saw no temperature check on respiration. This means that in many biomes, continued warming will cause photosynthesis to decline while respiration rates rise exponentially, tipping the balance of ecosystems from carbon sink to carbon source and accelerating climate change.""Different types of plants vary in the details of their temperature responses, but all show declines in photosynthesis when it gets too warm,"" said NAU co-author George Koch.Right now, less than 10 percent of the terrestrial biosphere experiences temperatures beyond this photosynthetic maximum. But at the current rate of emissions, up to half the terrestrial biosphere could experience temperatures beyond that productivity threshold by mid-century -- and some of the most carbon-rich biomes in the world, including tropical rainforests in the Amazon and Southeast Asia and the Taiga in Russia and Canada, will be among the first to hit that tipping point.""The most striking thing our analysis showed is that the temperature optima for photosynthesis in all ecosystems were so low,"" said Vic Arcus, a biologist at the University of Waikato and co-author of the study. ""Combined with the increased rate of ecosystem respiration across the temperatures we observed, our findings suggest that any temperature increase above 18 degrees C is potentially detrimental to the terrestrial carbon sink. Without curbing warming to remain at or below the levels established in the Paris Climate Accord, the land carbon sink will not continue to offset our emissions and buy us time.""Funding for this research was provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (grant NNX12AK12G), National Science Foundation (NSF) East-Asia Pacific Summer Institute Fellowship (1614404), the Royal Society of New Zealand Foreign Partnership Programme (EAP- UOW1601) and the New Zealand Marsden Fund (grant 16-UOW-027).

Over the last two decades, such acquisitions have resulted in millions of hectares of land changing hands in developing nations. Although such changeover can increase the cultivation of crops needed to feed the world's growing population and spark new agricultural practices and technologies, it can also lead to environmental degradation, increased carbon emissions and threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.","The socioeconomic and environmental consequences of such large-scale land acquisitions have been studied, but the effect of land grabs on carbon emissions has not, at least until now.In a newly published study in the journal ""Overall, the findings suggest there is a cost-effective way to produce more food while minimizing carbon emissions from this process,"" said Chuan Liao, assistant professor in ASU's School of Sustainability and lead author of the study.""It's unrealistic to say that we can't convert more land given that the world's population is growing especially in developing countries, but we still must minimize carbon emissions while pursuing agricultural development,"" he said.The study researchers analyzed countries that were engaged in over 1,000 transnational, large-scale land acquisitions. They identified three distinct geographic areas where land grabs take place including coastal West Africa and the East African Rift Valley; Southeast Asia; Central-South Latin America; and Eastern Europe and western Russia.The study showed that the quest for resources, like arable land and water, drives large-scale land acquisitions. That is, countries with low or medium-low arable land availability are usually investors, whereas those with medium-high or high arable land serve as hosts, said Liao. Likewise, countries with less water scarcity often supply land, whereas those countries with higher water scarcity invest in land.The researchers also estimated carbon emissions from nearly 1,500 cases of large-scale land acquisitions under two agricultural-development scenarios, including business as usual and enforcement of environmental regulations.In analyzing those emissions, the researchers found that the business-as-usual scenario, that is, clearing all vegetation from 37 million hectares of land, would emit approximately 2.26 gigatons of carbon. In contrast, implementing environmental regulations to constrain land conversion and save high-carbon-value forests would reduce emissions to 0.81 gigatons.The study also found that enforcing environmental regulation policies does not reduce the amount of land that can be used for agricultural development at the same proportion as the reduction in carbon emission.""Instead, we allow agricultural development on lands that have lower carbon values,"" explained Liao.

Anthropogenic climate change is expected to enhance methane emissions from wetlands, resulting in further warming. However, wetland methane feedbacks were not fully assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, posing a challenge to meeting the global greenhouse gas mitigation goals set under the Paris Agreement.","To understand how wetland methane cycling may evolve and drive climate feedbacks in the future, scientists are increasingly looking to Earth's past.""Ice core records indicate that atmospheric methane is very sensitive to climate, but we cannot measure atmospheric methane concentrations beyond them, prior to about 1 million years ago,"" said Dr Gordon Inglis, lead author and Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellow at the University of Southampton.""Instead, we must rely on indirect 'proxies' preserved within the sedimentary record. Proxies are surrogates for climate variables that cannot be measured directly, including geochemical data stored in fossils, minerals or organic compounds.""The study, which was published in The authors used a geochemical tool developed at the University of Bristol to analyse organic compounds made by microbes living in ancient soils and peats. During the PETM, they found the ratio of two carbon isotopes changed in these compounds -- a change that was likely due to an increased amount of methane in the microbes' diet.""We show that the PETM was associated with an increase in wetland methane cycling; if some of this methane escaped into the atmosphere, it would have led to additional planetary warming. Crucially, this could foreshadow changes that the methane cycle will experience in the future due to anthropogenic emissions,"" said Dr Gordon Inglis.""Our colleagues have previously shown the inclusion of methane emissions in climate model simulations is critical for interpreting past warmth. However, until recently, there have been no tools to test these predictions. This study confirms that methane cycling increased during the PETM, and perhaps during other warming events in Earth history,"" said Professor Rich Pancost, Head of the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.Intriguingly, proxies for temperature and methane cycling are only coupled at the onset of this ancient warming event, with the methane proxies rapidly returning to pre-event values even though temperatures remain high for the duration of the PETM.

""There simply has not been academic research on the evolving nature of news coverage given to pollinator declines, despite the importance of that topic within the scientific community.""The study also analyzed decades of coverage in three English-language wire services based abroad: Agence France Presse, in France; Deutsche Presse Agentur, in Germany; and Xinhua General News Service, in China. Berenbaum, often described as an ""ambassador for insects,"" initiated the project out of a desire to gauge public awareness of the pollinator-decline issue. She said she was startled by the results.""As much as the entomological community is gripped by this impending crisis, it appears the public isn't paying much attention,"" she said.

Algal blooms are likely to increase in Antarctica as the planet continues to warm, which will further exacerbate seasonal snowmelt and contribute to the expansion of ice-free areas in the AP region. This could have serious impacts on regional climate, snow and ice melt, freshwater availability and ecosystems, yet is not accounted for in current global climate models. Results of the research were published on January 13, 2021, in the European Geosciences Union's ","""Warming along the Antarctic Peninsula is causing drastic changes in snow and ice melt, as well as ecosystem responses,"" said Khan. ""We are seeing these algae blooms spread across wide areas along the coast. The blooms can be so intense and dark, like wearing a dark T-shirt on a sunny day, that they warm up the surface and cause more melting. The warming is likely expanding and strengthening the snow algae bloom season, which could continue to increase in this region of Antarctica as the climate continues to warm.""The researchers investigated the impacts of red and green algae on albedo, which is how much light the surface of the snow reflects back to space, and radiative forcing, which is how much energy the surface absorbs. Darker surfaces decrease albedo and increase radiative forcing, and positive radiative forcing causes the planet to warm. This is the first time that radiative forcing effects from algae have been estimated in the AP region. The scientists conducted this research by taking ground-based spectral albedo measurements of red and green snow algae at three sites in January 2018 and then modeled the radiative forcing using historical multi-year measurements of solar radiation at Palmer Station in Antarctica. Two of the ground sites were on King George Island, north of Palmer Station, and one was on Nelson Island. Because algal blooms are linked to animal waste, which produces the nutrients that the algae need to grow, the researchers chose sites that seals, penguins and other birds frequent.When compared with clean snow, the scientists found that green algae patches reduce snow albedo by 40 percent, and red algae patches reduce albedo by 20 percent. Green snow algae contain more chlorophyll than red snow algae and therefore absorb more solar radiation, reducing albedo by a greater amount for the same concentration of algae in the snow. As a result, radiative forcing averages are twice as high for green patches compared with red patches. During peak growing season, in austral summer, the increase in radiative forcing is about 26 watts per square meter, and about 13 watts per square meters for red algae. These amounts of radiative forcing are comparable to those caused by dust on snow in the mid-latitudes, such as in the Rocky Mountains, which advances snowmelt there. In the AP, algal blooms result in about 3,700 cubic meters, or over a million gallons of additional snow melt per year.""Antarctica is already an incredibly beautiful place, and snow algae blooms add an extra artistic dimension,"" said Ted Scambos, a polar researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the study. ""But like so many natural systems, the change in climate is pushing things to new extremes, with some unwanted consequences. We're seeing that these new darker and more widespread blooms are having a knock-on effect of accelerating melting, a feedback that makes the ice retreat a little faster.""The results of this research show that snow algae play a significant role in snowmelt in the AP regions where they occur, and should be accounted for in future estimates of ice-free expansion in the AP region. Future research will focus on a wider mapping the spread of algae blooms, and on the climate events that create the most intense blooms.",Climate,2021.0,"Warming in the Antarctic Peninsula is causing significant changes in snow and ice melt, as well as ecosystem responses.

Such a leading role for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica in global climate has been speculated but seeing it so clearly in geological evidence was very exciting.""Professor Ian Hall, co-author of the study and co-chief scientist of the IODP Expedition, also from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: ""Our results provide the missing link into how Antarctica and the Southern Ocean responded to the natural rhythms of the climate system associated with our orbit around the sun.""Over the past 3 million years the Earth has regularly plunged into ice age conditions, but at present is currently situated within an interglacial period where temperatures are warmer.However, due to the increased global temperatures resulting from anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the researchers suggest the natural rhythm of ice age cycles may be disrupted as the Southern Ocean will likely become too warm for Antarctic icebergs to travel far enough to trigger the changes in ocean circulation required for an ice age to develop.Professor Hall believes that the results can be used to understand how our climate may respond to anthropogenic climate change in the future.""Likewise as we observe an increase in the mass loss from the Antarctic continent and iceberg activity in the Southern Ocean, resulting from warming associated with current human greenhouse-gas emissions, our study emphasises the importance of understanding iceberg trajectories and melt patterns in developing the most robust predictions of their future impact on ocean circulation and climate,"" he said.Professor Grant Bigg, from the University of Sheffield's Department of Geography, who contributed to the iceberg model simulations, said: ""The groundbreaking modelling of icebergs within the climate model is crucial for identifying and supporting the ice-rafted debris hypothesis of Antarctic iceberg meltwater impacts which are leading glacial cycle onsets.""The Cardiff University-led study was funded by NERC.",Climate,2021.0,"Melting icebergs in the Antarctic are the key to triggering a series of chain reactions that cause Earth to experience prolonged periods of cold temperatures, according to researchers from Cardiff University.

The WEPP model provided the sediment sources from the agricultural fields under different tillage practices and the hydrologic model simulated sediment transport across the watershed.The researchers included historical data on climate, soil properties, sediment sample data, and other relevant measures, then used the coupled model to predict how different management practices affect soil erosion rates.""Farmers may prefer tilling because wet climate conditions cause compacted soil,"" Lee says. ""However, soil erosion removes topsoil, which contains lots of nutrients, and this may reduce yield in the long term. Soil erosion also affects water quality, both locally over time and at a distance.""Therefore, farmers need to weigh the benefits of tilling with the consequences of soil erosion and choose the best management strategies.""The modeling framework can help identify the most vulnerable areas, so producers can implement sustainable management practices where it matters most, Lee notes.",Climate,2021.0,"A study by the University of Illinois found that completely shifting to no-till farming could reduce soil loss and sediment yield by over 70%.

""Also, the paper used observations from UW and other teams around the world to compare to the climate model results. The main conclusion of the work is that wildfire smoke is more cooling than current models assume.""Murphy was a contributing author of a paper, titled ""Biomass Burning Aerosols in Most Climate Models Are Too Absorbing,"" that was published Jan. 12 (today) in Hunter Brown, who graduated from UW in fall 2020 with a Ph.D. in atmospheric science, was the paper's lead author. Other contributors to the paper included researchers from Texas A&M University; North Carolina A&T State University; the University of Georgia; the Finnish Meteorological Institute; the Center for International Climate and Environmental Science, and Norwegian Meteorological Institute, both in Oslo, Norway; the University of Reading in the United Kingdom; North-West University in South Africa; the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, China; and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash.The composition, size and mixing state of biomass burning aerosols determine the optical properties of smoke plumes in the atmosphere which, in turn, are a major factor in dictating how these aerosols perturb the energy balance in the atmosphere.""We found that many of the most advanced climate models simulate biomass burning aerosols or smoke that is darker, or more light absorbing, than what we see in observations,"" says Brown, of Juneau, Alaska. ""This has implications for the climate predictions made by these models.""Observations and models used in the study covered a wide temporal range. Africa, South America and Southeastern Asia, in addition to boreal fire regions, were chosen because these are the largest contributors to biomass burning smoke emissions in the world, Brown says.The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-Wyoming Supercomputing Center (NWSC) in Cheyenne was used for all of the data processing and the model sensitivity simulations, Brown says. Some of the other model data used for comparison in this study were generated elsewhere.""When we compare global observations of wildfire smoke to simulated wildfire smoke from a collection of climate models, the vast majority of the models have smoke that is more light absorbing than the observations,"" Brown explains. ""This means that more energy from the sun is going toward warming the atmosphere in these models, as opposed to what we see in these field campaigns and laboratory studies, which report less absorbing smoke that has more of a cooling effect by scattering light away from the Earth and back to space.""How absorbing these aerosols are in the atmosphere depends on the type of fuel that is burning, as well as the climate of the fire region. Generally, hot, dry grassland fires in Africa and Australia tend to have much darker smoke, which is more absorbing, while cooler, wetter boreal forest fires in North America and Northern Asia tend to have much brighter smoke, which is less absorbing.After researchers made aerosol improvements to the model, African wildfire smoke still tended to be more absorbing than observations. This might be explained by simplifications in how aerosols evolve over time in the model, or it may be due to a lack of observations from this part of the world biasing the results toward the boreal fire regime, Brown explains.""We were able to trace the disagreement between the model and observations to how the models represented the individual smoke particles, or aerosols, in the model,"" Brown says. ""This came down to how the model characterized their makeup, their size and the mixtures of different types of biomass burning aerosol. When we changed these variables in one of the models, we saw considerable improvement in the simulated smoke.""This comparison of computer models and global observations is valuable for model development groups and may help reduce uncertainty in biomass burning aerosol climate impacts in models, Brown says.",Climate,2021.0,"A study led by a University of Wyoming atmospheric scientist has found that wildfire smoke is more cooling than current climate models assume.

Corn farmers in the U.S. offset these losses with nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers also intended to boost yields, but scientists have never calculated how much of this fertilizer goes into just regaining baseline soil fertility -- or how much that costs.""We know there's land degradation going on even in U.S. modern agriculture, but it's really difficult to pin down how much and what impact it has,"" said Jason Neff, corresponding author on the paper and director of the Sustainability Innovation Lab at Colorado (SILC). ""These findings provide more information to farmers so they can make decisions that benefit them economically, but also support a more sustainable form of high-yield agriculture.""The U.S. is one of the most productive countries in the world when it comes to corn, growing more than 4.46 tons per acre farmed. In the 2018-19 growing season alone, U.S. farms produced more than 366 million metric tons of corn which generated $14.5 billion in revenue. The U.S. is also one of the world's largest users of fertilizer, applying more nitrogen and phosphorus per acre than its high-yield agricultural counterparts in the European Union.But using fertilizer doesn't just cost farmers and governments money. It also comes at an environmental cost. A large portion of the global greenhouse gas emissions caused by agriculture -- 24% of global emissions in 2010 and 10% of U.S. emissions in 2018 -- comes from fertilizer production. This means that steps taken to reduce fertilizer use also help address rising greenhouse gases.Excess nitrogen and phosphorus that runs off fields and into rivers and lakes also creates unhealthy conditions for freshwater and marine life, and is responsible for the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico -- a large area depleted of oxygen and devoid of ocean life, including many commercially important species. When we consider not only dollars spent by farmers but also nutrient loss and impacts to the Mississippi River, the costs go from billions to over a trillion dollars every year, said Neff.""If you can drop the fertilization, while maintaining the yields that we need and the economic outcomes that farmers want, then why not, right? That's a win-win,"" said Neff.To separate out this true cost of fertilizer from other modern agricultural inputs, Neff and his colleagues ran a series of scenario-based model analyses using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, a widely used agronomic model used to estimate crop growth and how crop growth responds to variables like fertilizer, irrigation and climate.""Doing that lets us then untangle, what's going on with degradation,"" he said. ""What's going on when you change a system from natural to agricultural, and how much of an impact does that have on the nutrients available for plant growth?""The researchers used four scenarios in this model to compare how using no fertilizer or irrigation -- as is in done in many developing economies -- differed from using only one or the other, or both (which is common practice in the U.S.). Irrigation was an important component of the analyses because while it can increase yields, it also increases erosion and fertilizer runoff.By separating the impacts of fertilizer and irrigation, the researchers could see in different regions of the U.S. where each was more important than the other for agricultural success. In California, farmers add more water. In Ohio, fertilizer additions are more important than irrigation. But across the country, they found that it took a whopping one third of fertilizer presently added to cornfields to simply break even, bringing soil fertility back to pre-farmed levels.While this may sound like bad news, Neff sees it as a golden opportunity: with more information, farmers can make better decisions.""Farmers do what makes sense to grow crops. When you're not able to see the cumulative effects of degradation, you have to add fertilizers but you're not going to know what the financial impact of that underlying degradation is,"" said Neff.Practices like regenerative agriculture, which restore soil fertility on lands actively being farmed, will also reduce the costs and environmental impacts of fertilizer use. Healthier, more fertile soils can also capture more carbon, hold more water and keep excess nutrients from running off into ecosystems that can't handle them.Farmers can reduce how often they till their fields, add and increase erosion control measures, as well as use more organic fertilizers, like compost. These can actually help reduce the amount of inorganic fertilizers -- nitrogen and phosphorus -- needed in the soil.""My hope is that this information supports national and international efforts to build back soil fertility,"" said Neff.",Climate,2021.0,"Long-term soil fertility in agricultural lands around the world is declining due to salinization, acidification, erosion and the loss of important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Corn farmers in the U.S. use nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to offset these losses, but scientists have never calculated how much of this fertilizer goes into regaining baseline soil fertility – or how much it costs. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus that runs off fields and into rivers and lakes creates unhealthy conditions for freshwater and marine life, and is responsible for the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico.

Not least how it affects animals and plants: Do they adapts, gradually migrate to different areas or become extinct? And what is the role played by human activities? This applies not least to Greenland and the rest of the Artic, which are expected to see the greatest effects of climate changes.","We know surprisingly little about marine species and ecosystems in the Arctic, as it is often costly and difficult to do fieldwork and monitor the biodiversity in this area', says Associate Professor of marine mammals and instigator of the study Morten Tange Olsen from the GLOBE Institute at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.To address these questions, researchers from the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources collected water samples in West Greenland with the help of local hunters and fishermen. Their method is simple: Go out to sea in a small boat and collect water in bottles. The content, however, is far more complex. The bottles with seawater contain so-called environmental DNA, which can provide insight into how climate changes and human activities impact the biodiversity. The researchers have chosen to focus on the bowhead whale, which constitutes a key species in the Arctic ecosystem and therefore is a good indicator of changes in water temperatures and sea ice cover.'The water samples contain enough DNA from bowhead whales to determine their presence, genetic diversity, the composition of the population and patterns of migration. You can actually monitor the marine biodiversity of the Arctic simply by going out in a small boat and collecting water in bottles, which is subsequently analysed in the DNA laboratory. This way, we are able to keep an eye on how humans and climate changes impact the bowhead whale and other marine life in the Arctic', says Morten Tange Olsen.Together with local hunters and fishermen in Qeqertarsuaq (Godhavn), the researchers collected more than 100 one-litre water samples from Disko Bay in West Greenland in May 2017 and 2018. In May, the sea ice has just broken up and bowhead whales visit the area to forage. The samples were collected from small boats along transects and specifically in the 'footprint' of bowhead whales -- the small ripples on the water surface created when the whales come up to breathe and dive again.'There is a lot more bowhead whale DNA in such a footprint than in a random water sample collected at the same time in the same area. You can find bowhead whale DNA in a footprint at least 10 minutes after the whale dove', says Natasja Lykke Corfixen, who helped initiate the study as part of her master's thesis at the Faculty of Science at the University of Copenhagen and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources.By optimising the DNA methods in the laboratory, the researchers hope to be able to sequence the whale's entire genome based on water samples. 'So far we have managed to sequence mitochondrial genomes from the water samples, and we are currently testing various methods for capturing the whale's entire genome, as well as the genomes of the algae and crustaceans that form part of their food chain', says PhD Student at the GLOBE Institute Dóra Székely.The researchers hope that by optimising DNA extraction and sequencing protocols, and learning more about the connection between genes, behaviour and health, they will eventually be able to use the method to monitor the health status of the bowhead whale and many other animals.'The field of Environmental DNA is seeing rapid development and is increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring in lakes, rivers, wetlands and, to some extent, the sea. We have shown that the method is also useful in the Arctic, and that it can be used to monitor not just the presence of a species, but also its diversity and patterns of movement. By further developing this simple method we are able to significantly increase our knowledge of marine biodiversity, and hopefully the impact of both climate changes and human activities', says Morten Tange Olsen.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources have collected water samples in West Greenland with the help of local hunters and fishermen to monitor the marine biodiversity of the Arctic.

""In the Northeastern United States, past trends and future predictions show a changing climate with warmer winters, more intense precipitation in winter and spring, and longer growing seasons with higher maximum temperatures. In almost all of our analyses, these conditions were associated with lower abundance of wild bees, suggesting that climate change poses a significant threat to wild bee communities.""According to Melanie Kammerer, graduate student in entomology, Penn State, few studies have considered the effects of both climate and land use on wild bees.""We thought this was an oversight because, like many organisms, bees are experiencing habitat loss and climate change simultaneously,"" she said. ""By looking at both factors in the same study, we were able to compare the relative importance of these two stressors.""To conduct their study, the researchers analyzed a 14-year United States Geological Survey data set of wild bee occurrences from more than 1,000 locations in Maryland, Delaware and Washington, D.C., specifically examining how different bee species and communities respond to land-use and climate factors.""To really understand the effects of weather and climate, particularly as weather patterns become more variable with climate change, we need to use these very large, long-term data sets,"" said Grozinger. ""We hope that our study, and others like it, will help encourage the collection and integration of these data sets for future research.""Using land cover maps and spatial models, the team described the landscape surrounding each of the sampling locations, including the habitat size and available floral and nesting resources. The team's results appear today (Jan. 12) in ""We found that temperature and precipitation patterns are very important drivers of wild bee communities in our study, more important than the amount of suitable habitat or floral and nesting resources in the landscape,"" said Kammerer.Interestingly, added Grozinger, different bee species were most affected by different weather conditions. For example, she said, areas with more rain had fewer spring bees.""We think the rain limits the ability of spring bees to collect food for their offspring,"" said Grozinger. ""Similarly, a very hot summer, which might reduce flowering plants, was associated with fewer summer bees the next year.""In addition, warm winters led to reduced numbers of some bee species.""This result coincides with studies showing that, with earlier spring onset, overwintering adults had higher pre-emergence weight loss and mortality and shorter life span post-emergence,"" Grozinger said.Kammerer noted that these weather changes will likely worsen in the coming years.""In the future, warm winters and long, hot summers are predicted to occur more frequently, which we expect will be a serious challenge to wild-bee populations,"" she said. ""We are just beginning to understand the many ways that climate influences bees, but in order to conserve these essential pollinators, we need to figure out when, where and how changing climate disrupts bee life cycles, and we need to move from considering single stressors to quantifying multiple, potentially interacting pressures on wild-bee communities.""According to the researchers, the study is part of the their larger Beescape project, which allows individuals -- including growers, conservationists and gardeners -- to explore the landscape quality at their site and potentially make adjustments to improve conditions for bees.

She examined the effects of increased temperatures on the growth, development and physiological performance of epaulette sharks -- an egg-laying species found only on the Great Barrier Reef. She and her team studied the sharks as embryos and as hatchlings.""We tested shark embryos in waters up to 31°C,"" Ms Wheeler said.""The hotter the conditions, the faster everything happened, which could be a problem for the sharks. The embryos grew faster and used their yolk sac quicker, which is their only source of food as they develop in the egg case.

Dr Rummer flags rising ocean temperatures as a major concern for the future of all sharks -- both egg-laying and live-bearing species.""The epaulette shark is known for its resilience to change, even to ocean acidification,"" Dr Rummer said. ""So, if this species can't cope with warming waters then how will other, less tolerant species fare?"" she said.Sharks and the class of animals they belong to, which includes rays and skates, are slow growing.

""Our analysis allows us to isolate how much of those changes in precipitation translate to changes in the cost of flooding, both now and in the future.""The global insurance company Munich Re calls flooding ""the number-one natural peril in the U.S."" However, although flooding is one of the most common, widespread and costly natural hazards, whether climate change has contributed to the rising financial costs of flooding -- and if so, how much -- has been a topic of debate, including in the most recent climate change assessments from the U.S. government and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.At the crux of that debate is the question of whether or not the increasing trend in the cost of flooding in the U.S. has been driven primarily by socioeconomic factors like population growth, housing development and increasing property values. Most previous research has focused either on very detailed case studies (for example, of individual disasters or long-term changes in individual states) or on correlations between precipitation and flood damages for the U.S. overall.In an effort to close this gap, the researchers started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data. They then applied advanced methods from economics to quantify the relationship between historical precipitation variations and historical flooding costs, along with methods from statistics and climate science to evaluate the impact of changes in precipitation on total flooding costs. Together, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the U.S., and that exceeding the levels of global warming agreed upon in the United Nations Paris Agreement is very likely to lead to greater intensification of the kinds of extreme precipitation events that have been most costly and devastating in recent decades.""Previous studies have analyzed pieces of this puzzle, but this is the first study to combine rigorous economic analysis of the historical relationships between climate and flooding costs with really careful extreme event analyses in both historical observations and global climate models, across the whole United States,"" said senior author and climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, the Kara J. Foundation Professor at Stanford Earth.""By bringing all those pieces together, this framework provides a novel quantification not only of how much historical changes in precipitation have contributed to the costs of flooding, but also how greenhouse gases influence the kinds of precipitation events that cause the most damaging flooding events,"" Diffenbaugh added.The researchers liken isolating the role of changing precipitation to other questions of cause and effect, such as determining how much an increase in minimum wage will affect local employment, or how many wins an individual player contributes to the overall success of a basketball team. In this case, the research team started by developing an economic model based on observed precipitation and monthly reports of flood damage, controlling for other factors that might affect flooding costs like increases in home values. They then calculated the change in extreme precipitation in each state over the study period. Finally, they used the model to calculate what the economic damages would have been if those changes in extreme precipitation had not occurred.""This counterfactual analysis is similar to computing how many games the Los Angeles Lakers would have won, with and without the addition of LeBron James, holding all other players constant,"" said study co-author and economist Marshall Burke, an associate professor of Earth system science.Applying this framework, the research team found that -- when totaled across all the individual states -- changes in precipitation accounted for 36 percent of the actual flooding costs that occurred in the U.S. from 1988 to 2017. The effect of changing precipitation was primarily driven by increases in extreme precipitation, which have been responsible for the largest share of flooding costs historically.""What we find is that, even in states where the long-term mean precipitation hasn't changed, in most cases the wettest events have intensified, increasing the financial damages relative to what would have occurred without the changes in precipitation,"" said Davenport, who received a Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship in 2020.The researchers emphasize that, by providing a new quantification of the scale of the financial costs of climate change, their findings have implications beyond flooding in the U.S.""Accurately and comprehensively tallying the past and future costs of climate change is key to making good policy decisions,"" said Burke. ""This work shows that past climate change has already cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars, just due to flood damages alone.""The authors envision their approach being applied to different natural hazards, to climate impacts in different sectors of the economy and to other regions of the globe to help understand the costs and benefits of climate adaptation and mitigation actions.""That these results are as robust and definitive as they are really advances our understanding of the role of historical precipitation changes in the financial costs of flooding,"" Diffenbaugh said. ""But, more broadly, the framework that we developed provides an objective basis for estimating what it will cost to adapt to continued climate change and the economic value of avoiding higher levels of global warming in the future.""",Climate,2021.0,"Climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the US, according to a study by Stanford University.

But because water and energy are inextricably linked, as we try to adapt to one challenge -- say, by getting more water via desalination or water recycling -- we may be worsening the other challenge by choosing energy-intensive processes.","So, in adapting to the consequences of climate change, how can we be sure that we aren't making problems worse?Now, researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), UC Berkeley, and UC Santa Barbara have developed a science-based analytic framework to evaluate such complex connections between water and energy, and options for adaptations in response to an evolving climate. Their study, ""Evaluating cross-sectoral impacts of climate change and adaptations on the energy-water nexus: A framework and California case study,"" was published recently in the open-access journal ""There have been many analyses on how climate change could affect the water and energy sectors separately, but those studies were not typically looking at interactions and feedbacks between the two,"" said lead author Julia Szinai of Berkeley Lab's Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division. ""Our paper develops a generalized framework that identifies how climate change affects these coupled water and electricity systems, and potential adaptations to future gaps in supply and demand. By doing so, we illustrate often-overlooked tradeoffs and synergies in adapting to climate change.""""In developing this project, Julia led a remarkable effort to integrate the climate impacts and feedbacks between the energy and water sectors,"" said co-author Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy and resources at UC Berkeley. ""What is critical to planning our future under climate change is to capture -- in both simplified and full dynamical models ¬- how interdependent are our infrastructure choices.""In applying the framework they developed to California, which relies on the snowpack for a good deal of its water and expends significant amounts of energy to transport water from the northern to the southern part of the state, they found that there are two possible adaptation pathways: one that is energy intensive and one that can actually save both water and energy.""One of the most important points of the paper is that adapting our water system to climate change can either significantly exacerbate electricity grid stress, or on the flip side, it could help to alleviate it,"" said co-author and Berkeley Lab climate scientist Andrew Jones. ""If we focus on adapting the water system by using big transfers of water across basins, or by using energy-intensive desalination, that's just going to make the electricity problem much more difficult. If, on the other hand, we adapt the water system by conserving water, it's actually a win-win situation because you're also reducing the energy required for water.""Currently, a staggering 19% of California's electricity consumption goes toward water-related applications, such as treating it, transporting it, pumping it, and heating it. Additionally, about 15% of in-state electricity generation comes from hydropower. Such interdependencies are referred to as the water-energy nexus. The state has already seen some impacts that climate change could have on these highly interdependent water-energy systems; for example, extended droughts and reduced snowpack have resulted in spikes in electricity consumption from groundwater pumping and hydropower deficits, which were made up by generating electricity using dirtier fossil fuels.Looking ahead, the researchers integrated data across a number of fragmented studies to estimate the overall range of possible water and energy futures under various climate scenarios for the state at the end of the century. Their analysis found that the greatest direct climate change impact on the electricity sector in California will likely come from two factors: higher air conditioning loads and decreased hydropower availability. In the water sector, the greatest and most uncertain impact of climate change is on future water supplies. In the worst case, available water supplies could decrease 25%, and in the best case could increase 46%.Applying their framework to California's water-energy future, they found that, if the state were to adapt to the worst-case water scenario by choosing the most energy-intensive technologies, it could result in an energy imbalance as large as that caused by climate change itself (increased air conditioning use and decreased hydropower availability being the climate change factors having the greatest direct energy imbalance impact).""I think this is the first study to show that water sector adaptation can have as large of an impact on the electricity sector as the direct effect of climate change itself,"" said Jones. ""So, if we pursued the energy-intensive path to water sector adaptation then it is as large as the direct effect of climate change, in the worst case.""Co-author Ranjit Deshmukh, a professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Barbara and faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab, noted, ""Going forward, the electricity sector could leverage its close coupling with the water sector to enable balancing of increasing wind and solar generation in California as the state strives to meet its low-carbon-emission goals. For example, energy-intensive equipment such as water pumps or desalination plants, with adequate water storage, could be operated during times of plentiful solar and wind energy, and turned off at other times.""Next, Szinai, a UC Berkeley graduate student, said she plans to develop detailed models of both water and electricity systems so researchers can run simulations under various climate change and climate change adaptation scenarios, ultimately aiding planners in building out both the electrical grid and water resources.""This study has highlighted the benefit of coordinated adaptation planning between the two sectors, so we're now linking a more detailed water resources management model and an electricity planning model that can demonstrate resilient pathways for building out electricity infrastructure in the Western U.S. when climate change impacts are included from the water sector,"" she said.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, UC Berkeley, and UC Santa Barbara have developed a framework to evaluate the complex connections between water and energy, and options for adaptations in response to climate change.

Among the 600 or so volcanoes that dot the landscape of the San Francisco volcanic fields, this one blew. It was the very first (and last) eruption for what came to be known as Sunset Crater, aptly named for its multi-hued, 1,000-foot-tall cinder cone.","Today, ASU School of Earth and Space Exploration scientist Amanda Clarke and her team have been working to solve the mysterious root cause of the Sunset Crater eruption and any lessons learned to better understand the threats similar volcanoes may pose around the world today.""This is a common thing in volcanology, to reconstruct past eruptions to try to understand what the volcano or region might do in the future,"" said Clarke. ""We did the field work and we combined data from a previous study and used some modern techniques to put the story together.""Working alongside several collaborators, they have painstakingly mapped every fissure, eruption deposit, and ancient lava flow of Sunset Crater to reconstruct the complete splatter patterns and geochemical compositions of all ejected materials, or tephra, from the eruption.""When you visit the site, there are these lava flows that are obvious, but also this big tephra blanket that extends far beyond the volcanic edifice itself, way beyond the vent,"" said Clarke. ""My interest was first piqued when I learned on a field trip many years ago with former ASU professor Stephen Self, that Sunset Crater had an explosive past.""In a previous study, Clarke's group first showed that the volcanic activity developed in seven or eight distinct phases: initial fissure phases, followed by highly explosive phases, and finally, low-explosivity, waning phases. ""It's not clear how this happens, but eventually, the eruption settled on this single pipeline to the surface, and that's where a lot of our work picks up the story,"" said Clarke.At several points during the explosive phase, the sky was filled with basaltic, cindery ash up to 20 to 30km high, making it one of the most explosive volcanic eruptions of its kind ever documented in the world.""People in Winslow [100km away] would have been able to see it,"" said Clarke. To give one an idea of the eruption size, they measured the total volume of eruption material, or 0.52 km3 dense rock equivalent (DRE) -- -which, by comparison, turned out to be similar to the volume of the infamous 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. ""It was very similar to Mt. St. Helens in terms of height and volume,"" said Clarke. ""You think these things that are cinder cones are going to be something like Stromboli in Italy -- -a fire fountain of a couple of hundred meters and people might be able to watch it from their terrace -- -but this peak phase was St. Helens scale.""But as to why it erupted, that has remained a mystery, until now. ""The science question is how these more liquidy magmas behave like viscous magmas,"" said Clarke. The study, published in the journal Measuring the factors that led to the Sunset Crater eruption 1,000 years later is an extremely difficult task because the gases that make up the magma usually escape into the sky during the eruption, forever lost in time. But to better reconstruct the past, the group have taken advantage of extensive microanalyses from the tiniest blobs and bubbles that are the best representation of the composition of magma from Sunset Crater before the eruption, known as melt inclusions. Roggensack is recognized as a world expert in innovative melt inclusion analysis, especially in basaltic magmas.How tiny? Melt inclusions are less than a thousandth of an inch across. They become embedded in time within growing crystals of the magma plumbing system that forms before a volcano erupts. ""They've been liberated from the magma in the explosion,"" said Clarke.They are like a fizzy, soda concoction of trapped gas, frozen in time from the surrounding magma as they crystalize, yet able to reveal the gas composition and secret history of an eruption so long ago.Think of the basaltic Sunset Crater having more of a maple syrup consistency versus the peanut butter variety of the rhyolite magma of Mt. St. Helens. ""Those are viscous magmas that can have a lot of water stuffed in them,"" said Clarke.""That leads to the big questions of what is the volatile content of the magma because that is going to control the explosivity,"" said Clarke. ""To answer the questions, you have to dig down deep into the plumbing system, and that's what we did.""Clarke's group is among the first to show the importance of carbon dioxide in volcanic eruptions, partly because it wasn't easy task to measure in the first place. ""We think this eruption could have pumped a fair amount of carbon dioxide and also sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere,"" said Clarke.""Water is usually the main component [as in Mt. St. Helens] but what we are finding at Sunset is that carbon dioxide is very abundant and that tends to be more critical in the deeper part of the system to get the magma moving toward the surface. We think that played a big role in this. And the carbon dioxide is probably coming from deep in the mantle within the source area.""The melt inclusions (MIs) were specifically chosen to provide a representative sample of textural features observed in the Sunset Crater eruption (e.g., varying bubble volumes, sizes and shapes). Some of the tools of the trade used were microscopes to bring the details of crystallization and bubble formation for each tiny melt inclusion to life, as well as sensitive instruments to measure the amount of volatiles trapped in the quenched glass.""That can tell us some of the details of the last moments of the magma before it was quenched.""Using a custom-built Raman spectrometer at ASU in the LeRoy Eyring Center for Solid State Science (LE-CSSS), Chelsea Allison set up the melt inclusion analysis in which samples are first excited using a blue sapphire laser. High-quality melt inclusions were polished and imaged with a petrographic microscope in preparation for Raman analysis.Like a Russian doll, nestled inside the little crystal is this little melt inclusion (now glass), and then inside the melt inclusion is a bubble, and inside the bubble is carbon dioxide.""Raman spectroscopy can be used to measure the density of carbon dioxide, and then from the volume and density of the bubble, you can use that to calculate a mass,"" said Clarke. ""Allison had to do all kinds of stuff including creating standards to ensure what she was measuring was accurate. She used known amounts of carbon dioxide inside little glass tubes to make a calibration curve.""""People used to ignore the bubbles, thinking there was nothing important inside, but it turns out it was almost all carbon dioxide,"" said Clarke. ""We've added that carbon dioxide inside the bubble to the total carbon dioxide budget of the magma.""""That all ties together, because once you have the volumes of the eruption, and the total volatile content of the magma, you can start understanding how much got ejected into the atmosphere, and what does that look like compared to other eruptions.""The carbon dioxide gas phase played a critical role in driving the explosive eruption, with the gas stored in the magma of Sunset Crater as deep as 15km below the surface.""We think that magma was bubbling already at 15km deep, and that's not what people typically think about magma systems with these volcanoes. It has been demonstrated before that you have a bubble phase. And if you have a system that is already bubbly and that deep, it means you might have a really rapid ascent.""Although, the impact of basaltic volcanism on the global atmospheric system is largely unknown, this high carbon dioxide and sulfur from the eruption could have also had a large impact on the atmosphere at the time of the eruption.They also compared the magmatic volatiles at Sunset Crater to those in explosive caldera-forming silicic eruptions such as the Bishop Tuff to highlight differences in their abundance and composition. This comparison suggested that the carbon dioxide rich phase is a critical pre-eruptive condition that drives highly explosive basaltic eruptions.Explosive silicic eruptions, although still much larger in terms of erupted volume, are better analogies to the dynamics of the Sunset Crater eruption. Two such historical eruptions, the 1991 eruption at Pinatubo (Philippines) and the 1815 eruption of trachyandesite at Tambora (Indonesia), resulted in profound atmospheric impacts.The Pinatubo eruption, which had significant impact on global climate for three years post-eruption, erupted 10 times the mass of magma (5 km3 DRE) as Sunset Crater (0.5 km3 DRE), but released just ~3 times the mass of sulfur dioxide. The Tambora eruption was responsible for the ""year without a summer,"" and while it erupted ~60 times the mass of magma (30 km3 DRE) as Sunset Crater, it released only ~9 times the mass of sulfur dioxide.The lessons learned from Sunset Crater and its type of basaltic volcanism could still inform us today.""Now we can ask, are the conditions that led to the Sunset Crater eruption really that unusual?"" said Clarke. ""How common is it for us to see a basaltic cinder cone that we think should be a gentle, observable eruption turn into something that is much more hazardous to aircraft flying overhead or to the people around it? We can start to apply these concepts to active systems.""""And remember, though the vent at Sunset Crater is not going to erupt again, the San Francisco field is still active. There will probably be another eruption there. It could be anywhere, and probably in the eastern sector, but we don't know where and when. It could be on a scale of thousands of years.""",Climate,2021.0,"Scientists from Arizona State University have investigated the Sunset Crater eruption in an attempt to better understand the threats posed by similar volcanoes around the world. The team mapped every fissure, eruption deposit and ancient lava flow of Sunset Crater to reconstruct the complete splatter patterns and geochemical compositions of all ejected materials. They also used microanalyses of tiny blobs and bubbles to determine the composition of magma before the eruption. By measuring the density of carbon dioxide in these bubbles, they found that carbon dioxide played a critical role in driving the explosive eruption, stored in the magma as deep as 15km below the surface.",,

""The process of how to do that is well-established, but the cost makes it not competitive, even with significant government subsidies. This new development is likely to help lower the cost.""At the heart of their discovery: A less expensive and simpler method to create the ""helper molecules"" that allow carbon in cells to be turned into energy. Those helper molecules (which chemists call cofactors) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and its derivative (NADPH). These cofactors in their reduced forms have long been known to be a key part of turning sugar from plants into butanol or ethanol for fuels. Both cofactors also play an important role in slowing the metabolism of cancer cells and have been a target of treatment for some cancers.But NADH and NADPH are expensive.""If you can cut the production cost in half, that would make biofuels a very attractive additive to make flex fuels with gasoline,"" said Vish Subramaniam, a senior author on the paper and recently retired professor of engineering at Ohio State. ""Butanol is often not used as an additive because it's not cheap. But if you could make it cheaply, suddenly the calculus would change. You could cut the cost of butanol in half, because the cost is tied up in the use of this cofactor.""To create these reduced cofactors in the lab, the researchers built an electrode by layering nickel and copper, two inexpensive elements. That electrode allowed them to recreate NADH and NADPH from their corresponding oxidized forms. In the lab, the researchers were able to use NADPH as a cofactor in producing an alcohol from another molecule, a test they did intentionally to show that ¬the electrode they built could help convert biomass -- plant cells -- to biofuels. This work was performed by Jonathan Kadowaki and Travis Jones, two mechanical and aerospace engineering graduate students in the Subramaniam lab, and Anindita Sengupta, a postdoctoral researcher in the Gopalan lab.But because NADH and NADPH are at the heart of so many energy conversion processes inside cells, this discovery could aid other synthetic applications.Subramaniam's previous work showed that electromagnetic fields can slow the spread of some breast cancers. He retired from Ohio State on Dec. 31.This finding is connected, he said: It might be possible for scientists to more easily and affordably control the flow of electrons in some cancer cells, potentially slowing their growth and ability to metastasize.Subramaniam also has spent much of his later scientific career exploring if scientists could create a synthetic plant, something that would use the energy of the sun to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. On a large enough scale, he thought, such a creation could potentially reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and help address climate change.""I've always been interested in that question of, 'Can we make a synthetic plant? Can we make something that can solve this global warming problem with carbon dioxide?'"" Subramaniam said. ""If it's impractical to do it with plants because we keep destroying them via deforestation, are there other inorganic ways of doing this?""This discovery could be a step toward that goal: Plants use NADPH to turn carbon dioxide into sugars, which eventually become oxygen through photosynthesis. Making NADPH more accessible and more affordable could make it possible to produce an artificial photosynthesis reaction.But its most likely and most immediate application is for biofuels.That the researchers came together for this scientific inquiry was rare: Biochemists and engineers don't often conduct joint laboratory research.Gopalan and Subramaniam met at a brainstorming session hosted by Ohio State's Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS), where they were told to think about ""big sky ideas"" that might help solve some of society's biggest problems.

""It's really important that we have good estimates of how likely extreme events are to occur and whether that likelihood is changing.""Although changes in precipitation and extreme streamflows have been observed in the past, there has been no research consensus on whether droughts and floods have actually increased in frequency.Past research efforts have mostly focused on annual peak flows, potentially missing important seasonal changes to extreme low-flow events that can be pulled from daily streamflow records. Those efforts have also been hampered by the mixing of data from regions that have different precipitation patterns and natural seasonal cycles.According to the research paper: the results demonstrate that ""increases in the frequency of both high- and low-flow extreme streamflow events are, in fact, widespread.""""Previous attempts to analyze regional pattern in streamflow were usually based on fixed geographical regions that were largely unsuccessful,"" said Carl Renshaw, a professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth. ""The novel clustering approach used in this research defines regions based on the hydrology -- not geographical or political boundaries -- to better reveal the significant shifts occurring for both high and low streamflows.""The Dartmouth study combined 541 rivers in the U.S. and Canada into 15 hydrological regions organized by seasonal streamflow characteristics, such as whether streams flood due to tropical storms or rain falling on melting snow. This grouping allowed for more sensitive detection of trends in extreme flow events on both an annual and seasonal basis.Out of the 15 ""hydro-regions"" created, 12 had enough rivers to be analyzed in the study. The rivers studied were judged to be minimally affected by human activity and included extensive records that span 60 or more years.""The shifts toward more extreme events are especially important given the age of our dams, bridges, and roads.

The research team believes that the increases in extreme precipitation during the high-flow season may make up for the reduction in snowpack storage.Changes in drought and extreme low-flow frequency were found to be more variable.While floods were found to be more localized, droughts were found to be ""generally reflective of large-scale climatic forcing"" and more likely to be widespread across a region.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study by Dartmouth College has found that the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, has increased in the US and Canada since the 1950s.

Their analysis found that two factors will likely dominate climate change's direct impacts on California's electricity sector: higher air conditioning loads and decreased hydropower availability.""One of the most important points of the paper is that adapting our water system to climate change can either significantly exacerbate electricity grid stress, or on the flip side, it could help to alleviate it,"" said co-author and Berkeley Lab climate scientist Andrew Jones. ""If we focus on adapting the water system by using big transfers of water across basins, or by using energy-intensive desalination, that's just going to make the electricity problem much more difficult. If, on the other hand, we adapt the water system by conserving water, it's actually a win-win situation because you're also reducing the energy required for water.""Currently, a staggering 19% of California's electricity consumption goes toward water-related applications, such as treating, transporting, pumping and heating. Additionally, about 15% of in-state electricity generation comes from hydropower.The state has already seen some impacts of climate change on its water-energy systems. Extended droughts exacerbated by climate change have led to spikes in electricity consumption for groundwater pumping, and corresponding hydropower deficits have required replacement by dirtier fossil fuels.The team is certain that the climate crisis will have a huge impact on the state's future water supplies. That said, the effect is wildly uncertain. In the worst case, available water supplies could decrease 25%; however, they could increase 46%.""There are significant uncertainties in the climate model projections for precipitation,"" said Deshmukh. ""But irrespective of those uncertainties, the adaptation measures offer significant co-benefits."" Conserving water would save energy as well as money for consumers, and allow for greater flow in the state's natural streams and rivers.When the team applied their framework to the worst-case scenario, they found that choosing the most energy-intensive adaptation strategies in the water sector could result in an energy imbalance as large as that caused directly by climate change.""I think this is the first study to show that water sector adaptation can have as large of an impact on the electricity sector as the direct effect of climate change itself,"" said Jones.""This study has highlighted the benefit of coordinated adaptation planning between the two sectors,"" added lead author Szinai, ""so we're now linking a more detailed water resources management model and an electricity planning model that can demonstrate resilient pathways for building out electricity infrastructure in the Western U.S. when climate change impacts are included from the water sector.""Deshmukh is currently leading a team to explore the connections between energy, water and the climate by quantifying the impacts of climate change on hydropower dams and thermal power plants in 12 countries across southern Africa. He hopes to identify optimal investments in electricity infrastructure.""California has a choice in how it wants to adapt its water sector to the impacts of climate change,"" Deshmukh stated. ""The state can either pursue energy intensive climate adaptation measures such as desalination or develop a portfolio of measures that maximize water conservation potential. Planners and policymakers in the water and energy sectors need to coordinate their actions and plans for adapting to climate change.""The study was supported by the Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Science Foundation. It is part of DOE's HyperFACETS project.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from UC Santa Barbara, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC Berkeley have developed a framework to evaluate how different climate adaptations may impact the water-energy nexus.

Their work also detected significant climatic warming throughout the years and found lizard body temperatures to have also increased accordingly. The findings show that lizard thermal biology is highly dependent on predation pressures and that body temperatures are rising suggest that such ectothermic predator-prey relationships may be changing under climatic warming.","The research published in the journal In this system, one dominant lizard species is found on all these islands; Okada's five-lined skink (Plestiodon latiscutatus). Its mainland predator, the Japanese four-lined rat snake (Elaphe quadrivirgata), is found on most but not all of the islands. This has resulted P. latiscutatus populations that have experienced different evolutionary pressures, either free from or subject to predation by E. quadrivirgata.The research was conducted by PhD student Félix LANDRY YUAN (HKU) and PhD Candidate Shun ITO (Tohoku University's Graduate School of Life Science) and led by Dr Timothy BONEBRAKE (HKU) and Professor Masami HASEGAWA (Toho). Initial observation and data collection was first started by Professor HASEGAWA in the early 1980's, when he first noticed lizard behaviour differed on islands with and without snakes. Professor Hasegawa has since continually visited the islands annually to catch lizards and snakes for body temperature and morphological measurements. The researchers have accordingly detected that annual temperatures across the Izu Islands had increased by just over 1°C since Professor Hasegawa first started his observations, and that lizard body temperature had also increased with the same magnitude.In addition to body temperature measurements, in 2018 and 2019 Félix Landry Yuan carried a portable racetrack, tripod and camera to the islands to measure the speed at which lizards ran at different temperatures. By analyzing thermally dependent running speeds of over 150 lizards across the islands, the researchers were able to establish how predation by snakes affected lizard thermal biology and the probable consequences for their fitness. Dr Bonebrake notes that: ""by racing lizards of different temperatures down a track, Félix was able to show that optimal temperatures were higher for lizards on the island with snakes, consistent with the high body temperatures observed on the island. Shun Ito was also able to identify differences in lizard hind leg length that had consequences for survival. Thus, the higher body temperatures and morphological differences help the lizards run faster and better escape the snakes. The exciting and unique aspect of this work is how the experimental work matches and supports the extensive natural history data and observation.""With climate change ongoing, the dynamics of this prey-predator relationship could be affected on islands with snakes, as lizard body temperatures are likely to continue to rise. In addition, as predation has considerable consequences for the thermal biology of its prey, the presence or absence of snake predators could differentially influence general vulnerability of lizards to climatic warming across islands.The Izu Islands demonstrate the value of island systems in teasing apart mechanisms through which predation directly influences behaviour, morphology and physiology of prey species. On the other hand, understanding the ways in which predation can affect prey responses to climate change requires long-term study. This international collaboration between HKU and Toho used these unique properties of this system (and Professor Hasegawa's forethought and intensive data collections since the 80s) to show how predator-prey relationships may be vulnerable in a warming climate. ""It is a great pleasure to reveal ecological and evolutionary responses among prey and predator interactions by this international research team. I'm very hopeful that the Izu islands become a key model island system to study ongoing evolution under global environmental change by attracting ambitious young Asian biologists to research this further."" Professor HASEGAWA said.",Climate,2021.0,"A study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that lizards living on islands with predators are better equipped to deal with climate change than those living without predators. The study focused on the Okada's five-lined skink, which lives on the Izu Islands in Japan, and its predator, the Japanese four-lined rat snake. The researchers found that lizards living on islands with snakes were better able to regulate their body temperature, allowing them to run faster and escape predators. As temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, the dynamics of this predator-prey relationship could be affected.",,

Here, most marine species have been at the limits of their tolerance to high temperatures for a long time -- and now they are already beyond those limits. Global warming has led to an increase in sea temperatures beyond those temperatures that Mediterranean species can sustain. Consequently, many of them are going locally extinct.","Paolo Albano's team quantified this local extinction for marine molluscs, an invertebrate group encompassing snails, clams and mussels. They thoroughly surveyed the Israeli coastline and reconstructed the historical species diversity using the accumulations of empty shells on the sea bottom.The shallow habitats at scuba diving depths are affected most. Here, the researchers were not able to find living individuals of up to 95 per cent of the species whose shells were found in the sediments. The study suggests that most of this loss has occurred recently, presumably in just the last few decades.Additionally, most of the species still found alive cannot grow enough to reproduce, ""a clear sign that the biodiversity collapse will further continue,"" says Albano. In contrast, the tropical species that enter from the Suez Canal thrive. The warm waters in the Eastern Mediterranean are very suitable habitats for them. Indeed, they occur in large populations and their individuals are fully fit to reproduce.""For anyone accustomed to snorkel or dive in the Mediterranean,"" explains the researcher, ""the underwater scenario in Israel is unrecognisable: The most common species are missing, while in contrast tropical species are everywhere.""The future perspectives for the Mediterranean are not good. The sea will continue to warm even if we would stop carbon dioxide emissions today. This is due to the inertia of the system, the long braking distance, so to speak.It is thus likely that the biodiversity collapse will continue to spread. It may already be occurring in other eastern Mediterranean areas not surveyed yet, and it will expand to the West and intensify. Only intertidal organisms, which are to some extent pre-adapted to temperature extremes, and habitats in deeper water, where the temperature is markedly lower, will continue to persist -- at least for some time.""But the future is dim unless we immediately act to reduce our carbon emissions and to protect marine habitats from other pressures which contribute to biodiversity loss,"" says Paolo Albano, ""The changes that already occurred in the warmest areas of the Mediterranean may not be reversible, but we would be able to save large parts of the rest of the basin.""Methodologically, the study was also interesting due to its interdisciplinary character: ""These results came from the cooperation of scientists with very different backgrounds,"" says Martin Zuschin, Head of the Department of Palaeontology and co-author of the study -- ""In particular, the cooperation between ecologists and palaeontologists is providing unique new views on how humankind is impacting biodiversity.""",Climate,2021.0,"Research led by Paolo Albano has found that up to 95% of marine mollusc species, including snails, clams and mussels, have become extinct along the Israeli coastline.

Not always, according to new research","El Niño events have long been perceived as a driver for low rainfall in the winter and spring in Hawai'i, creating a six-month wet-season drought. However, a recent study by researchers in the University of Hawai'i at Manoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) revealed the connection between Hawai'i winter rainfall and El Niño is not as straightforward as previously thought.","Studies in the past decade suggested that there are at least two types of El Niño: the Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific, when the warmest pool of water is located in the eastern or central portions of the ocean basin, respectively. El Niño events usually begin in summer and last for about one year.The UH M?noa team of atmospheric scientists analyzed data on the large-scale circulation patterns over the eastern and central Pacific to find that Hawai'i drought is only associated with the Eastern Pacific El Niño. For the central Pacific El Niño events, deficient rainfall in Hawaii occurred only 60% of the time. Therefore, a winter drought is not guaranteed following a Central Pacific El Niño.The differences in how the Eastern and Central Pacific El Niño affect rainfall can be critical for proper planning and water resource management.""This new result is a boon for many agencies in Hawai'i, for example, the Board of Water Supply, Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources, and Hawai'i Department of Agriculture,"" said Pao-Shin Chu, SOEST professor, Hawai'i State Climatologist and co-author of the study.

Scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder have discovered that a type of single-celled organism living in modern-day oceans may have a lot in common with life forms that existed billions of years ago -- and that fundamentally transformed the planet.","The new research, which will appear Jan. 6 in the journal These single-celled, photosynthetic organisms, also known as ""blue-green algae,"" can be found in almost any large body of water today. But more than 2 billion years ago, they took on an extra important role in the history of life on Earth: During a period known as the ""Great Oxygenation Event,"" ancient cyanobacteria produced a sudden, and dramatic, surge in oxygen gas.""We see this total shift in the chemistry of the oceans and the atmosphere, which changed the evolution of life, as well,"" said study lead author Sarah Hurley, a postdoctoral research associate in the departments of Geological Sciences and Biochemistry. ""Today, all higher animals need oxygen to survive.""To date, scientists still don't know what these foundational microbes might have looked like, where they lived or what triggered their transformation of the globe.But Hurley and her colleagues think they might have gotten closer to an answer by drawing on studies of naturally-occurring and genetically-engineered cyanobacteria. The team reports that these ancient microbes may have floated freely in an open ocean and resembled a modern form of life called beta-cyanobacteria.Studying them, the researchers said, offers a window into a time when single-celled organisms ruled the Earth.""This research gave us the unique opportunity to form and test hypotheses of what the ancient Earth might have looked like, and what these ancient organisms could have been,"" said co-author Jeffrey Cameron, an assistant professor of biochemistry.You can still make the case that cyanobacteria rule the planet. Hurley noted that these organisms currently produce about a quarter of the oxygen that comes from the world's oceans.One secret to their success may lie in carboxysomes -- or tiny, protein-lined compartments that float inside all living cyanobacteria. These pockets are critical to the lives of these organisms, allowing them to concentrate molecules of carbon dioxide within their cells.""Being able to concentrate carbon allows cyanobacteria to live at what are, in the context of Earth's history, really low carbon dioxide concentrations,"" Hurley said.Before the Great Oxidation Event, it was a different story. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may have been as much as 100 times what they are today, and oxygen was almost nonexistent. For that reason, many scientists long assumed that ancient microorganisms didn't need carboxysomes for concentrating carbon dioxide.""Cyanobacteria have persisted in some form over two billion years of Earth's history,"" she said. ""They could have been really different than today's cyanobacteria.""To find out how similar they were, the researchers cultured jars filled with bright-green cyanobacteria under conditions resembling those on Earth 2 billion years ago.Hurley explained that different types of cyanobacteria prefer to digest different forms, or ""isotopes,"" of carbon atoms. As a result, when they grow, die and decompose, the organisms leave behind varying chemical signatures in ancient sedimentary rocks.""We think that cyanobacteria were around billions of years ago,"" she said. ""Now, we can get at what they were doing and where they were living at that time because we have a record of their metabolism.""In particular, the team studied two different types of cyanobacteria. They included beta-cyanobacteria, which are common in the oceans today. But the researchers also added a new twist to the study. They attempted to bring an ancient cyanobacterium back from the dead. Hurley and her colleagues used genetic engineering to design a special type of microorganism that didn't have any carboxysomes. Think of it like a zombie cyanobacterium.""We had the ability to do what was essentially a physiological resurrection in the lab,"" said Boswell Wing, a study coauthor and associate professor of geological sciences.But when the researchers studied the metabolism of their cultures, they found something surprising: Their zombie cyanobacterium didn't seem to produce a chemical signature that aligned with the carbon isotope signatures that scientists had previously seen in the rock record. In fact, the best fit for those ancient signals were likely beta-cyanobacteria -- still very much alive today.The team, in other words, appears to have stumbled on a living fossil that was hiding in plain sight. And, they said, it's clear that cyanobacteria living around the time of the Great Oxygenation Event did have a structure akin to a carboxysome. This structure may have helped cells to protect themselves from growing concentrations of oxygen in the air.""That modern organisms could resemble these ancient cyanobacteria -- that was really counterintuitive,"" Wing said.Scientists, they note, now have a much better idea of what ancient cyanobacteria looked like and where they lived. And that means that they can begin running experiments to dig deeper into what life was like in the 2 billion-year-old ocean.""Here is hard evidence from the geological record and a model organism that can shed new light on life on ancient Earth,"" Cameron said.Other coauthors on the new paper included CU Boulder undergraduate student Claire Jasper and graduate student Nicholas Hill.",Climate,2021.0,"Cyanobacteria, also known as ""blue-green algae,"" played a significant role in the ""Great Oxygenation Event"" that occurred more than 2 billion years ago, producing a surge in oxygen gas that changed the evolution of life on Earth.

Dust from the deep sea provides a clue,"The westerlies -- or westerly winds -- play an important role in weather and climate both locally and on a global scale, by influencing precipitation patterns, impacting ocean circulation and steering tropical cyclones. So, finding a way to assess how they will change as the climate warms is crucial.","Typically, the westerlies blow from west to east across the planet's middle latitudes. But scientists have noticed that over the last several decades, these winds are changing, migrating poleward. Research suggests this is because of climate change. But, scientists have been debating whether the poleward movement of the westerlies will continue as temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide (COIn a paper published January 6 in The finding represents a breakthrough in our understanding of how the winds changed in the past, and how they may continue to change in the future.By using dust in ancient, deep sea sediments as an indirect tracer of wind, the researchers were able to reconstruct wind patterns that occurred three to five million years ago. Knowing that winds -- in this case the westerlies -- transport dust from desert regions to faraway locations, the authors examined cores from the North Pacific Ocean. This area is downwind from Eastern Asia, one of the largest dust sources today and a known dust-generating region for the past several million years. By measuring the dust in cores from two different sites thousands of kilometers apart, the researchers were able to map changes in dust, and in turn the westerly winds.""We could immediately see the patterns. The data are so clear. Our work is consistent with modern observations, and suggests that wind patterns will change with climate warming,"" said Abell.They found that during the warm parts of the Pliocene (a period three to five million years ago, when the Earth was about two to four degrees Celsius warmer than today but had approximately the same concentration of CO""By using the Pliocene as an analogue for modern global warming, it seems likely that the movement of the westerlies towards the poles observed in the modern era will continue with further human-induced warming,"" explained Winckler.The movement of these winds have huge implications for storm systems and precipitation patterns.

At the same time, some species will likely disappear. 25 researchers recently presented these and many other findings in a major international project, in which they analysed hundreds of articles on the Antarctic published in the past ten years. By doing so, the team have provided an exceptionally comprehensive assessment of the status quo and future of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean that surrounds it.","Never before have researchers arrived at so many new findings on the biological and biochemical processes at work in the Antarctic than in the past ten years. Now 25 experts, led by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), have analysed and compiled these findings in the project ""AnT-ERA."" Having ultimately processed several hundred articles on the Antarctic, the team have now distilled the content into ten core messages addressing a broad range of aspects, e. g. ocean acidification, biodiversity, and the significance of sea ice for various organisms. ""If you look at the timeframe from 1970 to the present, roughly 80 percent of all academic publications on biology and biochemistry in the Antarctic were released between 2010 and 2020. That's what moved us to condense this enormous amount of knowledge into a single article,"" says marine biologist and project coordinator Julian Gutt from the AWI. The project outcomes have just been published in the journal One major finding is that the waters of the Antarctic are very likely to grow warmer due to climate change, which in turn increases the probability that plant and animal species from warmer regions will migrate to the Antarctic. In this regard, not just the temperature, but also the future sea-ice cover will be crucial. For example, in the decades to come, the experts expect to see a more intense greening of ice-free coastal areas during the southern summer, as new mosses or lichens migrate. Initially, there will likely be a rise in biodiversity. However, a prolonged warming would have grave consequences for those species that are adapted to extremely low temperatures. ""We believe these species will retreat to the last remaining extremely cold regions of the Antarctic,"" says Gutt. ""That also means we'll need to protect the regions in order to save these species.""When it comes to ocean acidification, the study's forecast is bleak: by the end of the century, the experts expect the waters of the Antarctic to be extensively acidified. ""There can be no doubt that especially those organisms that form calcareous shells are going to have serious problems,"" Gutt explains. ""We can't yet say for certain if they will all go extinct, or if some species will manage to adapt their metabolisms to the new conditions."" A surprising finding from research conducted in the past ten years: the ostensibly docile organisms that live on the floor of the Antarctic Ocean, e.g. some sponges and ascidians, respond rapidly to improved conditions -- by growing quickly or reproducing intensively. The downside: they are equally sensitive to poor environmental conditions. Given the major changes that climate change will entail, these species could also be in danger.Whereas the Antarctic Peninsula, which extends into the South Atlantic, has been warming for some time now, in the past three years the warming, and therefore the loss of sea ice, has spread to East Antarctica. The experts can't yet say whether this is the beginning of a long-term trend, or only a short-term variation. In either case, this change in the physical environmental parameters is troubling, because it could have a substantial impact on the future development of life in the Southern Ocean.It also remains unclear whether or not the loss of sea ice will mean that the waters of the Antarctic, due to intensified algal growth, absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Principally speaking, most experts assume that algal growth increases when sea ice retreats, because the algae e. g. are exposed to more sunlight. Since algae absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via photosynthesis when they grow, this process can improve the ocean's absorption of COThe experts chiefly attribute the fact that so many new insights have been gathered in recent years to technological advances -- e. g. in molecular biological methods, new ships and stations, and remotely operated underwater vehicles, some of which can even navigate below the ice. In addition, new numerical and conceptual models are helping us to understand interconnections in the ecosystem.

As a result, fishing communities are quite resilient. That is, they can withstand, recover from, and adapt to change.","But how much pressure can they stand? The 2014-2016 North Pacific marine heatwave, known as the Blob, led to a harmful algal bloom of unprecedented scale. It necessitated substantial delays in the opening of the 2015-16 U.S. West Coast Dungeness crab fishery. The fishery is vital to West Coast communities. It produces around 26 percent of all annual fishing revenue and supports more than 30 percent of all commercial fishing vessels.Previous studies have documented the devastating economic impacts from the 2015-16 event on Dungeness crab fishermen. Members of affected coastal communities attest that these socioeconomic effects rippled through associated industries and coastal communities. But can changes in fishing practices in response to this significant climate shock be quantified?""We wanted to examine the extent to which the Dungeness crab fishery delays affected participation in other fisheries, and the duration of those changes,"" said Mary Fisher, a doctoral student at the University of Washington. Fisher did the work as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program Fellow at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.Fisher and her colleagues at NOAA Fisheries, University of Washington, and Oregon State University studied the impacts on more than 2,500 vessels across seven California fishing communities. The researchers wanted to see how a climate-related shock (like the heatwave and associated harmful algal bloom) can impact communities' use of ocean resources.The researchers used 10 years of fishery landings data to map resource use networks for seven California port groups where Dungeness crab is an important revenue source. The networks visualize the portfolio of fisheries that a community harvests and how vessels move between fisheries. The network visualization is similar to a food web, except that the connections represent harvest by fishing vessels rather than predator-prey relationships.Researchers found that 71 percent of California Dungeness crab fishing vessels temporarily left the industry and stopped fishing altogether during the delays. The two other strategies that fishermen used to cope with the disruption were:These strategies significantly changed communities' resource use patterns, but some communities were more affected by the climate shock than others. Researchers could predict which communities would be least sensitive to the shock by looking at their resource use patterns before the 2015-16 season.These communities, located in central California, were less dependent on Dungeness crab and had shorter fishery delays. In these communities, fishermen had access to more open fisheries during the winter months and were more flexible in how they fished previously. These characteristics provided more options, buffering fishermen from the disruption to the Dungeness crab fishing season.No matter how central Dungeness crab was to a community's fisheries portfolio, the researchers didn't observe any significant, lasting changes in how vessels participated in fisheries after the closures lifted. This suggests fishing communities may mostly return to ""normal"" fishing practices relatively quickly after short-term disturbances like climate shocks, provided those changes don't pile up one after the other.The results highlight the importance of nearshore groundfish fisheries like sablefish, rockfish, and lingcod as alternatives to the Dungeness crab fishery. ""Most of the crab vessels that stayed out on the water were using pot or hook-and-line gear to fish groundfish,"" says Fisher. ""I think we can expect access to these fisheries to continue to be important during crab season delays.""Fishermen with larger vessels also landed their catch at different ports, a strategy less common among smaller vessels. This was possible in part because regulations only restricted fishing in delayed areas at the district level. In 2018, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife amended these rules, called the Fair Start Provisions. The amendments provide more protection to fishermen at a finer scale than districts in the event of future delays.",Climate,2021.0,"A study conducted by researchers from the University of Washington, Oregon State University, and NOAA Fisheries has shown that changes in fishing practices can be quantified following significant climate shocks.

Until now, the reason for this was not entirely clear. A current study of the University of Bonn (Germany) now sheds light on this: It indicates that the collapse of coastal ecosystems was caused by climatic changes. In contrast, falling sea level or overuse by humans are not likely to be the reasons. The speed of the mangrove extinction was dramatic: Many of the stocks were irreversibly lost within a few decades. The results are published in the journal ","Mangroves are trees that occupy a very special ecological niche: They grow in the so-called tidal range, meaning coastal areas that are under water at high tide and dry at low tide. Mangroves like a warm climate; most species do not tolerate sea surface temperatures below 24 °C (75°F). They are tolerant to salt, but only up to a tolerance limit that varies from species to species. ""This is why we find them nowadays mostly in regions where enough rain falls to reduce salinization of the soil,"" explains Valeska Decker of the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn, the lead author of the study.Fossil finds prove that there used to be many mangrove lagoons on the coast of Oman. However, some 6,000 years ago these suddenly largely vanished - the reasons for this were previously disputed. Over the past few years, Decker traveled several times to the easternmost country of the Arabian Peninsula to pursue this question for her doctoral thesis. With the support of her doctoral supervisor Prof. Gösta Hoffmann, she compiled numerous geochemical, sedimentological and archaeological findings into an overall picture. ""From our point of view, everything suggests that the collapse of these ecosystems has climatic reasons,"" she says.Along the equator there is a low pressure trough, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which is situated a little further north or south depending on the season. The Indian summer monsoon, for example, is linked to this zone. It is believed that about 10,000 years ago this zone was much further north than today, which meant the monsoon affected large parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Just over 6,000 years ago this low-pressure trough then shifted to the south, but the reason for this and how fast is still not completely clear.""That this was the case has been well documented for several years,"" explains Decker. ""Our results now indicate that this climate change had two effects: On the one hand, it caused salinization of the soil, which put the mangroves under extreme stress. On the other hand, the vegetation cover in the affected areas decreased in general due to the greater drought."" This increased erosion: The wind carried large amounts of the barren soil into the lagoons. These silted up and successively dried up. The whole thing happened surprisingly fast: ""The ecosystems probably disappeared within a few decades,"" stresses Decker. According to previous studies, the environmental changes were gradual. The mangrove ecosystems struggled till a certain threshold was reached and then collapsed within decades. Nowadays, the only mangroves in Oman are those of a particularly robust species and are found only in a few places.She was able to exclude other possible causes for the disappearance of the mangroves in her study. For example, the researchers found no evidence of a drop in sea level 6,000 years ago that could have triggered the mangrove extinction. ""Archaeological findings also speak against a man-made ecological catastrophe,"" she says. ""It is true that there were humans living in the coastal regions who used the mangroves as firewood. However, they were nomads who did not build permanent settlements. This meant that their need for wood was relatively low - low enough to rule out overuse as a cause.""Decker and her colleagues now want to further investigate how much the annual precipitation changed and what impact this had on the region. To this end, the researchers plan to study the pollen that has persisted in the lagoon sediment for thousands of years. They want to find out how the vegetation changed as a result of the drought. The results could also be relevant for us: In many regions of the world, the climate is changing at a dramatic pace. Germany has also suffered increasingly from long droughts in recent years. Foresters are therefore already planning to plant more drought-resistant species in this country; this is a consequence of climate change that may leave long-term marks in the history of vegetation.",Climate,2021.0,"Mangroves, which grow in tidal coastal areas, require warm temperatures and are tolerant to salt up to a limit that varies by species. A study by the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn has found that mangroves disappeared from Oman's coast around 6,000 years ago due to climatic reasons. The Intertropical Convergence Zone, a low pressure trough along the equator, shifted southwards, causing salinization of the soil and drought, which led to erosion and drying up of the lagoons within decades. The study found no evidence of a man-made ecological catastrophe or a drop",,

Fossil leaf assemblages from Patagonia, Argentina, suggest that vegetation in South America suffered great losses but rebounded quickly, according to an international team of researchers.","""Every mass extinction event is like a reset button, and what happens after that reset depends on which organisms survive and how they shape the biosphere,"" said Elena Stiles, a doctoral student at the University of Washington who completed the research as part of her master's thesis at Penn State. ""All the biodiversity that we observe today is related to the organisms that made it past the last big reset 66 million years ago.""Stiles and her colleagues examined more than 3,500 leaf fossils collected at two sites in Patagonia to identify how many species from the geologic period known as the Cretaceous survived the mass extinction event into the Paleogene period. Although plant families in the region fared well, the scientists found a surprising species-level extinction rate that may have reached as high as 92% in Patagonia, higher than previous studies have estimated for the region.""There's this idea that the Southern Hemisphere got off easier from the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction than the Northern Hemisphere because we keep finding plant and animal groups that no one thought survived,"" said Peter Wilf, professor of geosciences at Penn State and associate in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. ""We went into this study expecting that Patagonia was a refuge, and instead we found a complex story of extinction and rebound.""Researchers from Penn State; the Museo Paleontologico Egidio Feruglio (MEF), Chubut, Argentina; Universidad Nacional del Comahue INIBIOMA, Rio Negro, Argentina; and Cornell University had been collecting the fossils for years from the two sites, in what is now Chubut province. Unlike North America, where the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary is well known from many sites in the western United States, the fossil record from this period is fragmented across the Southern Hemisphere, a result of rapidly changing ancient environments.""Most of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary interval known from the Southern Hemisphere is marine,"" said Ari Iglesias, a researcher at Universidad Nacional del Comahue INIBIOMA. ""We were interested in obtaining the continental record, what happened on land. So, in this study we tried to get as close to the K-Pg boundary as possible, and we reached it in a small area in Chubut province. There we found floras right before the K-Pg boundary, or Maastrichtian floras, and right after the K-Pg boundary, so Danian age floras.""The assemblages that the team obtained constitute the most complete collection of late Cretaceous and early Paleogene fossil floras in the Southern Hemisphere, added Iglesias.The researchers studied the assemblages for survivor pairs -- plants that grew in both the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods -- and found few species-level matches. They then compared their findings to previous pollen and insect herbivory studies from the same area and to North American fossil records. Their study, which is the first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, appears in the journal Paleobiology.""The 92% extinction estimate we get when we consider fossil leaf species across the K-Pg boundary should be taken as a maximum"" Stiles said. ""We were surprised to find such high extinction levels compared with the 60% extinction rate seen in North America. Nonetheless, we observed a sharp drop in plant species diversity and a high species-level extinction.""Ecosystem recovery likely took millions of years, added Stiles, which is a small fraction of Earth's nearly 4.5-billion-year history.Stiles also led a novel morphospace analysis to identify changes in leaf shape from the Cretaceous to the Paleogene, as such changes could provide clues to the kinds of environmental and climatic occurrences that took place across the boundary interval. She studied each leaf fossil for nearly 50 features, including shape, size and venation patterns.The analysis showed a higher diversity of leaf forms in the Paleogene, which surprised the researchers given the high species-level extinction and drop in number of species at the end of the Cretaceous. They also found an increase in the proportion of leaf shapes typically found in cooler environments, which suggests that climatic cooling occurred after the end-Cretaceous extinction event.The researchers' findings, combined with those of previous studies, suggest that despite the high species-level extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, South American plant families largely survived and grew more diverse during the Paleogene. Among the survivors were the laurel family, which today includes plants such as bay leaves and avocados, and the rose family, which includes fruit like raspberries and strawberries.""Plants are often overlooked in these big events in geologic history,"" Stiles said. ""But really, because plants are the primary producers on terrestrial landscapes and sustain all other life forms on Earth, we should be paying closer attention to the plant fossil record. It can tell us how the landscape changed and how those changes affected different groups of organisms.""The Geological Society of America, Mid-American Paleontological Society, National Science Foundation and Penn State, through a Charles E.

In the journal,"The Great Famine (1315-1321) is considered the largest pan-European famine of the past millennium. It was followed a few years later by the Black Death (1346-1353), the most devastating pandemic known, which wiped out about a third of the population. At least partially responsible for both of these crises was a phase of rapid climate change after 1310, called the ""Dantean Anomaly"" after the contemporary Italian poet and philosopher Dante Alighieri. The 1310s represent a transitional phase from the High Medieval Climate Anomaly, a period of relatively high temperatures, to the Little Ice Age, a long climatic period characterized by lower temperatures and advancing glaciers.The Leipzig-based researchers are studying the regions of northern Italy, southeastern France, and east central Europe. These areas have been little studied with regard to the Great Famine thus far, but offer a variety of historical sources for the reconstruction of extreme meteorological events and their socio-economic effects, including how vulnerable societies were at the time. ""We want to show that historical climate change can be reconstructed much better if written historical sources are incorporated alongside climate archives like tree rings or sediment cores. The inclusion of humanities research clearly contributes to a better understanding of the social consequences of climate change in the past and to drawing conclusions for the future,"" explains Dr Martin Bauch from the GWZO, who heads the junior research group.The study now published evaluates a large number of historical sources: chronicles from present-day France, Italy, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Regional and municipal chronicles provided information on historical city fires, which were an important indicator of droughts. Administrative records from Siena (Italy), the County of Savoy (France) and the associated region of Bresse shed light on economic developments there. Using the data, it was possible, for example, to estimate wheat and wine production in the French region of Bresse and compare it with wheat production in England. Since these yields depend strongly on climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation, it is thus possible to draw conclusions about the climate in the respective production years.While the summer of 1302 was still very rainy in central Europe, several hot, very dry summers followed from 1304 onwards. From the perspective of climate history, this was the most severe drought of the 13th and 14th centuries. ""Sources from the Middle East also report severe droughts. Water levels in the Nile, for example, were exceptionally low. We therefore think that the 1304-06 drought was not only a regional phenomenon, but probably had transcontinental dimensions,"" reports Dr. Thomas Labbé from the GWZO.Based on the recorded effects, the team reconstructed the historical weather conditions between the summer of 1302 and 1307. Through evaluations of the 2018 drought and similar extreme events, it is now known that, in such cases, a so-called ""precipitation seesaw"" usually prevails. This is the meteorological term for a sharp contrast between extremely high precipitation in one part of Europe and extremely low precipitation in another. ""This is usually caused by stable high and low pressure areas that remain in one region for an unusually long time. In 2018, for example, very stable lows lay over the North Atlantic and southern Europe for a long time, which led to heavy precipitation there and an extreme drought in between in central Europe,"" explains meteorologist Dr Patric Seifert from TROPOS, who was responsible for reconstructing the large-scale weather situations for the study. The analysis of the possible large-scale weather situations indicates that between 1303 and 1307, a strong, stable high pressure system predominated over central Europe, which explains the extreme drought in these years.The analysis of these historical weather situations is particularly interesting given the ongoing discussion about how climate change in the Arctic affects weather patterns in Europe. In recent decades, the Arctic has warmed more than twice as much as other regions of the world. This phenomenon, called ""Arctic Amplification,"" is being studied by a DFG Collaborative Research Centre led by the University of Leipzig. One theory assumes that the disproportionate warming of the Arctic causes the temperature differences -- and thus also the atmospheric dynamics -- between the mid-latitudes and the region around the North Pole to decrease. As a result, according to a common hypothesis, weather patterns may persist longer than in the past. ""Even if it was a phase of cooling in the Middle Ages and we are now living in a phase of man-made warming, there could be parallels. The transitional period between two climate phases could be characterized by smaller temperature differences between the latitudes and cause longer-lasting large-scale weather patterns, which could explain an increase in extreme events,"" Seifert cautions.In their study, the researchers recorded a noticeable coincidence between the periods of drought and urban fires. Fires were a great danger for the densely constructed cities in the Middle Ages, where there were no fire brigades like there are today. The best documented fire between 1302 and 1307 was probably in Florence, where over 1,700 houses burned on 10 June 1304. Sources for Italy and France showed a correlation between extreme drought and fires. ""We think our analysis is the first to find a correlation between fires and droughts over a two-hundred-year period. Large urban fires usually followed droughts by a year. The wooden structures in medieval houses did not dry out immediately. But once they did, they ignited very easily,"" explains Bauch. Contemporaries were also aware of the connection between drought and fire: during dry periods, citizens were obliged to place buckets of water next to their front doors -- a primitive sort of fire extinguisher, to be kept available at all times. It was only later that municipalities organized fire brigades, for example in Florence around 1348. Major infrastructural measures in response to the droughts have survived in the cities of northern Italy: Parma and Siena invested in larger, deeper wells, and Siena also bought a harbor on the Mediterranean coast, which it expanded after the drought years of 1302-04 in order to be able to import grain and become less dependent on domestic production.""According to our analysis, the drought of 1302-1307 was a once-in-a-century event with regard to its duration. No other drought reached these dimensions in the 13th and 14th centuries. The next event that came close was not until the drought of 1360-62, which stretched across Europe and for which there indications in the historical record in Japan, Korea, and India,"" concludes Annabell Engel, M.A., from GWZO. In connection with global warming, researchers expect more frequent extreme events such as droughts. While numerous studies have already documented strong fluctuations in the 1340s, shortly before the plague epidemic, the first decade of the 14th century, unlike the 1310s, has been the focus of little research so far. The Leibniz researchers have now been able to show for the first time that exceptionally dry summers between 1302 and 1304 to the south of the Alps and 1304 and 1307 north of the Alps were the result of stable weather conditions and disparately distributed precipitation. The study thus sheds new light on the first years of the 14th century with its dramatic changes and draws a link to modern climate changes. ""However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about future climatic developments in the 21st century from our study. While climate fluctuations in the 14th century were natural phenomena, in the modern age, humans are exerting artificial influence on the climate, as well,"" note Bauch and Seifert.",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers from the University of Leipzig have used historical sources to reconstruct the climate of the 14th century and the events that followed. The Great Famine, which took place between 1315 and 1321, was followed by the Black Death, which killed a third of Europe's population between 1346 and 1353. Both events were partially caused by the Dantean Anomaly, a period of rapid climate change that took place after 1310 and which marked the transition between the High Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. The researchers used chronicles from France, Italy, Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic to evaluate the effects",,

SSW events are some of the most extreme of atmospheric phenomena and can see polar stratospheric temperature increase by up to 50°C over the course of a few days. Such events can bring very cold weather, which often result in snowstorms.The infamous 2018 ""Beast from the East"" is a stark reminder of what an SSW can bring. The disturbance in the stratosphere can be transmitted downward and if this continues to the earth's surface, there can be a shift in the jet stream, leading to unusually cold weather across Europe and Northern Asia. It can take a number of weeks for the signal to reach the surface, or the process may only take a few days.The study, published in the Findings in the paper, Tracking the stratosphere-to-surface impact of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings suggest split events tend to be associated with colder weather over north west Europe and Siberia.Lead author of the study, Dr Richard Hall, said there was an increased chance of extreme cold, and potentially snow, over the next week or two:""While an extreme cold weather event is not a certainty, around two thirds of SSWs have a significant impact on surface weather. What's more, today's SSW is potentially the most dangerous kind, where the polar vortex splits into two smaller ""child"" vortices.""""The extreme cold weather that these polar vortex breakdowns bring is a stark reminder of how suddenly our weather can flip.

It lets a potentially dangerous prey animal, a large tapir, pass by, but when the ocelot stops to drink, the jaguar pounces and carries off the smaller predator.The event, detailed in a recent study published in the journal ""Although these predator-on-predator interactions may be rare, there may be certain instances when they become more prevalent, and one of those could be over contested water resources,"" said Daniel Thornton, a WSU assistant professor and co-author on the paper.

The more isolated and rare water resources become, the more they're going to become hotspots of activity.""Jaguars which can weigh more than 200 pounds typically prey on small animals like armadillos or peccaries. Ocelots, also carnivores, are smaller than their larger jaguar cousins at around 18 to 44 pounds, and their activity patterns overlap with the jaguars particularly in twilight periods of the day.While some research has noted signs of ocelot in jaguar feces, until now, no known images have been captured of a jaguar directly killing an ocelot.""These dramatic camera trap images clearly show the fierce competition wildlife face for precious resources like water,"" said Rony García-Anleu of WCS's Guatemala Program and a co-author of the study.

""However, the recent trends we see towards the expansion of pasture land and higher livestock numbers lead us to expect that global grasslands will accelerate climate warming if better policies are not put in place to favor soil carbon increases, stop deforestation for ranching, and develop climate-smart livestock production systems.""According to the authors, the cooling services provided by sparsely grazed or wild grasslands, makes it clear that countries should assess not only the greenhouse gas budgets of their managed pastures (such as specified in the current national greenhouse gas reporting rules of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change), but also the sinks and sources of sparsely grazed rangelands, steppes, tundra, and wild grasslands. Full greenhouse gas reporting for each country could facilitate the assessment of progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and better link national greenhouse gas budgets to the observed growth rates of emissions in the atmosphere.""In the context of low-warming climate targets, the mitigating or amplifying role of grasslands will depend on a number of aspects.

These so-called hydrothermal explosions can hurl mud, sand and rocks into the air and release hot steam, endangering lives; such an explosion on White Island in New Zealand in December 2019 killed 22 people.","A new study by geoscientists who study geysers throws cold water on that idea, finding few indications of underground magma movement that would be a prerequisite to an eruption. The geysers sit just outside the nation's largest and most dynamic volcanic caldera, but no major eruptions have occurred in the past 70,000 years.""Hydrothermal explosions -- basically hot water exploding because it comes into contact with hot rock -- are one of the biggest hazards in Yellowstone,"" said Michael Manga, professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and the study's senior author. ""The reason that they are problematic is that they are very hard to predict; it is not clear if there are any precursors that would allow you to provide warning.""He and his team found that, while the ground around the geyser rose and seismicity increased somewhat before the geyser reactivated and the area currently is radiating slightly more heat into the atmosphere, no other dormant geysers in the basin have restarted, and the temperature of the groundwater propelling Steamboat's eruptions has not increased. Also, no sequence of Steamboat eruptions other than the one that started in 2018 occurred after periods of high seismic activity.""We don't find any evidence that there is a big eruption coming. I think that is an important takeaway,"" he said.The study will be published this week in Manga, who has studied geysers around the world and created some in his own laboratory, set out with his colleagues to answer three main questions about Steamboat Geyser: Why did it reawaken?

By comparing the column heights of 11 different geysers in the United States, Russia, Iceland and Chile with the estimated depth of the reservoir of water from which their eruptions come, they found that the deeper the reservoir, the higher the eruption jet. Steamboat Geyser, with a reservoir about 25 meters (82 feet) below ground, has the highest column -- up to 115 meters, or 377 feet -- while two geysers that Manga measured in Chile were among the lowest -- eruptions about a meter (3 feet) high from reservoirs 2 and 5 meters below ground.""What you are really doing is you are filling a container, it reaches a critical point, you empty it and then you run out of fluid that can erupt until it refills again,"" he said. ""The deeper you go, the higher the pressure. The higher the pressure, the higher the boiling temperature. And the hotter the water is, the more energy it has and the higher the geyser.""To explore the reasons for Steamboat Geyser's variability, the team assembled records related to 109 eruptions going back to its reactivation in 2018. The records included weather and stream flow data, seismometer and ground deformation readings, and observations by geyser enthusiasts. They also looked at previous active and dormant periods of Steamboat and nine other Yellowstone geysers, and ground surface thermal emission data from the Norris Geyser Basin.They concluded that variations in rainfall and snow melt were probably responsible for part of the variable period, and possibly for the variable period of other geysers as well. In the spring and early summer, with melting snow and rain, the underground water pressure pushes more water into the underground reservoir, providing more hot water to erupt more frequently. During winter, with less water, lower groundwater pressure refills the reservoir more slowly, leading to longer periods between eruptions. Because the water pushed into the reservoir comes from places even deeper than the reservoir, the water is decades or centuries old before it erupts back to the surface, he said.In October, Manga's team members demonstrated the extreme impact water shortages and drought can have on geysers. They showed that Yellowstone's iconic Old Faithful Geyser stopped erupting entirely for about 100 years in the 13th and 14th centuries, based on radiocarbon dating of mineralized lodgepole pine trees that grew around the geyser during its dormancy. Normally the water is too alkaline and the temperature too high for trees to grow near active geysers. The dormancy period coincided with a lengthy warm, dry spell across the Western U.S. called the Medieval Climate Anomaly, which may have caused the disappearance of several Native American civilizations in the West.""Climate change is going to affect geysers in the future,"" Manga said.Manga and his team were unable to determine why Steamboat Geyser started up again on March 15, 2018, after three years and 193 days of inactivity, though the geyser is known for being far more variable than Old Faithful, which usually goes off about every 90 minutes. They could find no definitive evidence that new magma rising below the geyser caused its reactivation.The reactivation may have to do with changes in the internal plumbing, he said. Geysers seem to require three ingredients: heat, water and rocks made of silica -- silicon dioxide. Because the hot water in geysers continually dissolves and redeposits silica -- every time Steamboat Geyser erupts, it brings up about 200 kilograms, or 440 pounds of dissolved silica. Some of this silica is deposited underground and may change the plumbing system underneath the geyser. Such changes could temporarily halt or reactivate eruptions if the pipe gets rerouted, he said.Manga has experimented with geysers in his lab to understand why they erupt periodically, and at least in the lab, it appears to be caused by loops or side chambers in the pipe that trap bubbles of steam that slowly dribble out, heating the water column above until all the water can boil from the top down, explosively erupting in a column of water and steam.Studies of water eruptions from geysers could give insight into the eruptions of hot rock from volcanoes, he said.""What we asked are very simple questions and it is a little bit embarrassing that we can't answer them, because it means there are fundamental processes on Earth that we don't quite understand,"" Manga said. ""One of the reasons we argue we need to study geysers is that if we can't understand and explain how a geyser erupts, our hope for doing the same thing for magma is much lower.""",Climate,2021.0,"A new study has found that there are few indications of underground magma movement that would be a prerequisite to an eruption at Yellowstone National Park's Steamboat Geyser. While the geysers sit just outside the nation's largest and most dynamic volcanic caldera, no major eruptions have occurred in the past 70,000 years. The study found that while the ground around the geyser rose and seismicity increased somewhat before the geyser reactivated, and the area currently is radiating slightly more heat into the atmosphere, no other dormant geysers in the basin have restarted, and the temperature of the groundwater propelling Steamboat",,

A new discovery by Brown University researchers could provide scientists a new way to reconstruct sea ice abundance and distribution information from the ancient past, which could aid in understanding human-induced climate change happening now.","In a study published in ""We've shown that this molecule is a strong proxy for sea ice concentration,"" said Karen Wang, a Ph.D. student at Brown and lead author of the research. ""Looking at the concentration of this molecule in sediments of different ages could allow us to reconstruct sea ice concentration through time.""Other types of alkenone molecules have been used for years as proxies for sea surface temperature. At different temperatures, algae that live on the sea surface make differing amounts of alkenones known as C37:2 and C37:3. Scientists can use the ratios between those two molecules found in sea sediments to estimate past temperature. C37:4 -- the focus of this new study -- had been long considered a bit of problem for temperature measurements. It turns up in sediments taken from closer to the Arctic, throwing off the C37:2/C37:3 ratios.""That was mostly what the C37:4 alkenone was known for -- throwing off the temperature ratios,"" said Yongsong Huang, principal investigator of the National Science Foundation-funded project and a professor in Brown's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Science. ""Nobody knew where it came from, or whether it was useful for anything. People had some theories, but no one knew for sure.""To figure it out, the researchers studied sediment and sea water samples containing C37:4 taken from icy spots around the Arctic. They used advanced DNA sequencing techniques to identify the organisms present in the samples. That work yielded previously unknown species of algae from the order Isochrysidales. The researchers then cultured those new species in the lab and showed that they were indeed the ones that produced an exceptionally high abundance of C37:4.The next step was to see whether the molecules left behind by these ice-dwelling algae could be used as a reliable sea ice proxy. To do that, the researchers looked at concentrations of C37:4 in sediment cores from several spots in the Arctic Ocean near the present-day sea ice margins. In the recent past, sea ice in these spots is known to have been highly sensitive to regional temperature variation. That work found that the highest concentrations of C37:4 occurred when climate was coldest and ice was at its peak. The highest concentrations dated back to the Younger-Dryas, a period of very cold and icy conditions that occurred around 12,000 years ago. When climate was at its warmest and ice ebbed, C37:4 was sparse, the research found.""The correlations we found with this new proxy were far stronger than other markers people use,"" said Huang, a research fellow at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. ""No correlation will be perfect because modeling sea ice is a messy process, but this is probably about as strong as you're going to get.""And this new proxy has some additional advantages over others, the researchers say. One other method for reconstructing sea ice involves looking for fossil remains of another kind of algae called diatoms. But that method becomes less reliable further back in time because fossil molecules can degrade. Molecules like C37:4 tend to be more robustly preserved, making them potentially better for reconstructions over deep time than other methods.The researchers plan to further research these new algae species to better understand how they become embedded in sea ice, and how they produce this alkenone compound. The algae appear to live in brine bubbles and channels inside sea ice, but it may also bloom just after the ice melts. Understanding those dynamics will help the researchers to better calibrate C37:4 as a sea ice proxy.Ultimately, the researchers hope that the new proxy will enable better understanding of sea ice dynamics through time. That information would improve models of past climate, which would make for better predictions of future climate change.",Climate,2021.0,"A new method for reconstructing sea ice concentration through time has been discovered by researchers at Brown University.

""That's part of why cost-effective reduction of deforestation ought to be part of the foundation of global climate change mitigation strategies.""Deforestation, Alix-Garcia adds, is a key factor behind the 40% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the dawn of the industrial age, which in turn is contributing heavily to a warming planet.

""One is because GLAD added more to efforts in Africa than on other continents, in the sense that there was already some evidence of countries using monitoring systems in countries like Indonesia and Peru. And Colombia and Venezuela, which are a large part of our sample, had significant political unrest during this period.""The GLAD program is still young and as more groups sign up to receive alerts and decide how to intervene in deforestation, the system's influence may grow, she added.""Now that we know subscribers of alerts can have an effect on deforestation, there are ways in which our work can potentially improve the training the subscribers receive and support their efforts,"" Moffette said.",Climate,2021.0,"The Global Land Analysis and Discovery System (GLAD) has resulted in carbon sequestration benefits worth hundreds of millions of dollars in its first two years, according to research including Oregon State University’s Jennifer Alix-Garcia.

Red tide is a phenomenon in which phytoplankton proliferate as nutrient or sewage flow into seawater, making it appear red. This not only causes damage to the fisheries industry but also affects the marine ecosystem.","Professor Kitack Lee and Ph.D. candidate Ji-Young Moon (first author) of POSTECH's Division of Environmental Science and Engineering have confirmed that the inflow of nitrogen pollutants since the 1980s has disturbed the nutrient balance in the northeast Asian waters and is changing the species of phytoplankton responsible for red tide. The team also found that the fastest change in the oceanic conditions caused by this inflow of nitrogen pollutants is happening in the waters near the Ieodo Ocean Research Station, located downstream of the Changjiang River of China. These findings were recently introduced in the journal The Northeast Asia region, including Korea, China, and Japan, has seen an increase of nitrogen pollutants because of the rapid population growth and industrialization in modern times. As the nitrogen pollutant flows into the sea as a result of floods and monsoons, northeast Asian waters have experienced an unexpected massive fertilization. Many scientists have warned that these nitrogen pollutants not only increase harmful algae bloom in the coastal waters, but also lead to deterioration of water quality and changes in the formation of marine ecosystem species.The researchers analyzed the nutrient concentration data and the occurrence of red tide in the East China seas and coastal waters of the Korean Peninsula in the past 40 years since the 1980s. The results show that a wide range of oceans in this region have changed from being nitrogen deficient to phosphorus (P) deficient, while at the same time the concentration of nitrate (N) has been higher than that of silicate (Si). In particular, it has been confirmed that the major phytoplankton in Korea's coastal waters are also changing from diatoms to dinoflagellates.The research team explained that this is direct evidence that the nutrient regime in the northeast Asian marginal sea is changing as the amount of nitrogen pollutants is increasing, which is further creating phytoplankton species and disrupting the marine ecosystem.At the same time, the team verified that the fastest place to see these oceanic changes due to the inflow of nitrogen pollutants was in the waters around Ieodo Ocean Research Station.""Since the changes in the waters near Ieodo Ocean Research Station will soon occur in the waters near the Korean Peninsula, long-term observation of the concentration of nutrient in the coastal waters and changes in the ecosystem are necessary,"" proposed Professor Kitack Lee who led the study.

That is what researchers at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) produced after two years of research in order to better understand past climate patterns of the Asian Monsoon region.","Home to many populous river basins, including ten of the world's biggest rivers, the Asian Monsoon region provides water, energy, and food for more than three billion people. This makes it crucial for us to understand past climate patterns so that we can better predict long term changes in the water cycle and the impact they will have on the water supply.To reconstruct histories of river discharge, the researchers relied on tree rings. An earlier study by Cook et al. (2010) developed an extensive network of tree ring data sites in Asia and created a paleodrought record called the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (MADA). SUTD researchers used the MADA as an input for their river discharge model.They developed an innovative procedure to select the most relevant subset of the MADA for each river based on hydroclimatic similarity. This procedure allowed the model to extract the most important climate signals that influence river discharge from the underlying tree ring data.""Our results reveal that rivers in Asia behave in a coherent pattern. Large droughts and major pluvial periods have often occurred simultaneously in adjacent or nearby basins. Sometimes, droughts stretched as far as from the Godavari in India to the Mekong in Southeast Asia. This has important implications for water management, especially when a country's economy depends on multiple river basins, like in the case of Thailand,"" explained first author Nguyen Tan Thai Hung, a PhD student from SUTD.Using modern measurements, it has been known that the behaviour of Asian rivers is influenced by the oceans. For instance, if the Pacific Ocean becomes warmer in its tropical region in an El Nino event, this will alter atmospheric circulations and likely cause droughts in South and Southeast Asian rivers. However, the SUTD study revealed that this ocean-river connection is not constant over time. The researchers found that rivers in Asia were much less influenced by the oceans in the first half of the 20th century compared to the 50 years before and 50 years after that period.""This research is of great importance to policy makers; we need to know where and why river discharge changed during the past millennium to make big decisions on water-dependent infrastructure. One such example is the development of the ASEAN Power Grid, conceived to interconnect a system of hydropower, thermoelectric, and renewable energy plants across all ASEAN countries.

""We've always known that waves were an important part of the cliff erosion process, but we haven't been able to separate the influence of waves and rain before.""After decades of debate over the differing roles that waves and rain play in cliff erosion, the findings provide a new opportunity to improve forecasts, which is a pressing issue both in Del Mar and across the California coast. For example, neighborhoods and a railroad line the cliff edge in Del Mar. Past episodes of cliff failures have resulted in several train derailments and landslides, which trigger temporary rail closures and emergency repairs. The consequences can be costly.Prior to Young's study, the exact relationship between waves, rain, and cliff failures were unclear, mostly because it is difficult to measure the impacts of waves on the cliff base.""Anytime a study involves sensors in the coastal zone, it's a challenge,"" said Young. For example, his team at Scripps Oceanography's Center for Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation buries sensors in the sand that measure wave energy. Big surf and erosion can shift the sensors and prevent scientists from collecting reliable measurements.The key to their success, according to Young, was to visit and measure the cliffs every week for three years -- an effort that was among the most detailed ever undertaken for studying coastal cliffs. These records along the 1.5 mile-long stretch in Del Mar allowed Young's team to untangle the effects of rainfall and groundwater runoff from wave impacts.""We can now better predict how much erosion will occur during a particular storm using the wave and rainfall erosion relationship that we've identified here,"" said Young.Young's group combined measurements from the sensors buried in the sand with computer models of wave energy, as well as with three-dimensional maps of the beach and cliffs collected using a LiDAR device -- a laser mapping tool -- that was mounted onto trucks driven along the beach. The team also analyzed rainfall data from a local Del Mar weather station.Because rainfall and associated elevated groundwater levels trigger larger landslides, cliff erosion generally appears to be more correlated with rain. Teasing out the wave-driven cliff erosion is a more subtle and difficult process, but important because the wave-driven erosion weakens the cliff base and sets the stage for those rain-driven landslides.Understanding the way that cliffs and waves behave together will help improve short-term models that forecast cliff retreat, but the researchers will need more information to predict how future rainfall and waves will drive cliff erosion in the long term.Young and his group plan to continue to collect data in Del Mar, and are developing a website to make the information about the conditions leading to coastal landslides readily available.",Climate,2020.0,"A three-year study has found that waves and rain have differing effects on cliff erosion, with waves impacting the base and rain mostly impacting the upper region of cliffs.

Gary Belovsky and Jennifer Slade of The University of Notre Dame, Indiana, present these findings in the open-access journal ","Intermountain bunchgrass prairie is one of North America's most endangered ecosystems, now covering less than 1 percent of the area it once did. Over the past century, bunchgrass prairies have become warmer and drier, and human-driven climate change is expected to continue that trend, with potential impacts on bunchgrass ecosystems. However, bunchgrass is often overlooked in studies of grasslands.To better understand the effects of climate change on bunchgrass prairies, Belovsky and Slade studied the National Bison Range, a bunchgrass prairie in Montana, for 40 years. They made repeated observations of plant growth and production, abundances of different plant species, and availability of nitrogen (an important nutrient for plants), generating a comprehensive timeline of ecosystem changes.Over the course of the study, annual temperatures rose and precipitation declined in the prairie, making it more susceptible to fire. Surprisingly, the researchers found that annual aboveground primary production -- the amount of plant material produced every year -- rose by 110 percent, associated with increased precipitation and cooler temperatures during the important growth period of late May through June. However, this was associated with a change in plant composition, with a 108 percent increase in invasive species, more drought-tolerant species being favored overall, and declines in dicot non-grass plants (decreasing by 65 percent) over the 40-year study period.The researchers also found that other ecosystem changes followed seasonal climate trends, instead of annual trends. For instance, summer temperatures were higher than might be expected from annual trends, boosting summer senescence -- the yearly ""browning"" of green plant material.These findings highlight the importance of considering local and seasonal changes when forecasting the effects of climate change on a given ecosystem. The authors report that intermountain bunchgrass prairie could be morphing into a different type of grassland that may be previously unknown.Dr. Belovsky adds: ""Forecasting climate change effects on plant production based on expected average annual increased temperature and decreased precipitation may not be appropriate, because seasonal climate changes may be more important and may not follow average annual expectations.""",Climate,2020.0,"The intermountain bunchgrass prairie, one of North America's most endangered ecosystems, is under threat from human-driven climate change.

Many people are not even aware that an inland lake is dramatically shrinking due to climate change, as our models indicate,"" says Matthias Prange. The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also failed to mention lakes, and disregarded the social, political and economic consequences of global warming on the affected regions. ""This has to change. We need more studies and a better understanding of the consequences of global warming in this region."" The goal must be to raise awareness of the consequences of climate change for inland seas and lakes so that appropriate strategies can be developed, including approaches for other large lakes and regions facing similar challenges.Because of its size (it is the largest lake in the world) and because of its relatively high salinity of about one per cent, which is about one-third of the salt concentration in the oceans, the Caspian has been named a 'Sea'. Its largest inflow is the Volga River and it has no natural connection to the ocean. The water level is determined by the proportional influences of inflow, precipitation and evaporation. Global warming is causing increased evaporation, which results in a declining water level.The Caspian Sea is an important regional water reservoir and, despite its salt content, a biological and commercial center. It is bounded by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia. Depending on the degree of global warming in the future, the water level could fall by 9 to 18 meters during this century. ""This would affect not only the biodiversity, various species, and habitats that would disappear. The economies of all the bordering countries would be impacted, including harbors, fisheries and fish farming."" For this reason, the authors argue that in the future the Caspian Sea should be used as an example in scientific research to assess the vulnerability of certain regions to falling water levels. Because no nation can solve the resulting conflicts alone, they propose a global task force to develop and coordinate strategies. The article suggests that ""international climate funds"" could offer a possibility for financing projects and adaptation measures if changes in the lake level are attributed to climate change.",Climate,2020.0,"The Caspian Sea is shrinking due to climate change, which is causing increased evaporation and a declining water level.

However, in the recovery phase, emissions could rise to levels above those projected before the pandemic. It all depends on how the stimulus money that governments inject into their economies is spent. A team of scientists, led by Dr Yuli Shan and Professor Klaus Hubacek from the University of Groningen, has quantified how different recovery scenarios may affect global emissions and climate change. Their results were published in ","The worldwide recession caused by the coronavirus has had a profound impact on greenhouse gas emissions that is likely to continue in the coming years.

The COShan and his colleagues from the Netherlands, the UK and China used a recently developed economic impact model to calculate the direct and indirect effects from the lockdowns, but also the effects of stimuli in different scenarios. These calculations were performed for economies in 41 countries, representing some 90 per cent of the global economy. ""We did this for entire global supply chains,' explains Shan. 'For example, if China has to stop producing certain goods, this could also impact production in the US or in Europe.""The calculations were performed for allocation of the stimuli to five different economic categories (construction, manufacturing, service sector, health sector and households) and for different policy aims. ""These vary in the amount of carbon emissions that they will produce,"" explains Shan. The results of the different scenarios were then quantified in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.""The models show that without structural change, we will see a V-shaped response,"" says Hubacek. In that case, the emissions will quickly increase to pre-crisis levels and perhaps even exceed those levels. ""Our results show how far apart the different scenarios can bring us."" Emissions could drop by 6.6 gigatons of carbon (-4.7 per cent) or increase by 23.2 gigatons (+12.1 per cent). ""There is plenty of room to go the wrong way,"" says Hubacek. ""And a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.""Stimulus packages should target innovations, support the energy transition and help households to invest in the adoption of renewable energy. ""Spending this money to bail out carbon-intensive sectors such as airlines is heading in the wrong direction. It is much better to improve public transport and railways."" Hubacek's message is that the COVID-19 crisis has made a big dent in greenhouse gas emissions and that we should use this for our benefit. ""This crisis is awful, but it is also a wake-up call for action against climate change. We are now in a position to really do something about it.""However, there is also a big risk: governments must borrow billions for the stimulus packages. The increases in national debts leave little space for further investments in the next few decades. ""So, if we do not invest in low-carbon alternatives now, it will not happen for a long time."" This would mean that greenhouse gas emissions could increase beyond what was predicted before the pandemic.""Our next project is to study the EU economy in greater detail, but still embedded in the global model.

Previous imaging research had only pointed to layered interactions between carbon and minerals in soils.""If there is an overlooked mechanism that can help us retain more carbon in soils, then that will help our climate,"" said senior author Johannes Lehmann, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science, Soil and Crop Sciences Section, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Angela Possinger Ph.D. '19, who was a graduate student in Lehmann's lab and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech University, is the paper's first author.Since the resolution of the new technique is near atomic scale, the researchers are not certain what compounds they are looking at, but they suspect the carbon found in soils is likely from metabolites produced by soil microbes and from microbial cell walls. ""In all likelihood, this is a microbial graveyard,"" Lehmann said.""We had an unexpected finding where we could see interfaces between different forms of carbon and not just between carbon and minerals,"" Possinger said. ""We could start to look at those interfaces and try to understand something about those interactions.""The technique revealed layers of carbon around those organic interfaces. It also showed that nitrogen was an important player for facilitating the chemical interactions between both organic and mineral interfaces, Possinger said.As a result, farmers may improve soil health and mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration by considering the form of nitrogen in soil amendments, she said.While pursuing her doctorate, Possinger worked for years with Cornell physicists -- including co-authors Lena Kourkoutis, associate professor of applied and engineering physics, and David Muller, the Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Engineering in Applied and Engineering Physics, and the co-director of the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science -- to help develop the multi-step method.The researchers planned to use powerful electron microscopes to focus electron beams down to sub-atomic scales, but they found the electrons modify and damage loose and complex soil samples. As a result, they had to freeze the samples to around minus 180 degrees Celsius, which reduced the harmful effects from the beams.""We had to develop a technique that essentially keeps the soil particles frozen throughout the process of making very thin slices to look at these tiny interfaces,"" Possinger said.The beams could then be scanned across the sample to produce images of the structure and chemistry of a soil sample and its complex interfaces, Kourkoutis said.""Our physics colleagues are leading the way globally to improve our ability to look very closely into material properties,"" Lehmann said.

It is a major part of our planet's carbon cycle, shuttling carbon dioxide between the land, sea and air, and influencing global temperatures.""Weathering is like a planetary thermostat -- it's the reason why Earth is habitable. Scientists have long suggested this is why we don't have a runaway greenhouse effect like on Venus,"" said lead author Ed Tipper from Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences. By locking carbon dioxide away in sediments, weathering removes it from the atmosphere over long timescales, reducing the greenhouse effect and lowering global temperatures.The team's new calculations show that, across the globe, weathering fluxes have been overestimated by up to 28%, with the greatest impact on rivers in mountainous regions where rocks are broken down faster.They also report that three of the largest river systems on Earth, including the neighbouring Yellow and Salween Rivers with their origins on the Tibetan Plateau and the Yukon River of North America, do not absorb carbon dioxide over long timescales -- as had been thought.For decades the Tibetan plateau has been invoked as a long term sink for carbon and mediator of climate. Some 25% of the sediment in the world's oceans originate from the plateau.""One of the best places to study the carbon cycle are rivers, they are the arteries of the continents. Rivers are the link between the solid Earth and oceans -- hauling sediments weathered from the land down to the oceans where their carbon is locked up in rocks,"" said Tipper.""Scientists have been measuring the chemistry of river waters to estimate weathering rates for decades,"" said co-author Victoria Alcock ""Dissolved sodium is one of the most commonly measured products of weathering -- but we've shown that it's not that simple, and in fact sodium often comes from elsewhere.""Sodium is released when silicate minerals, the basic building blocks of most of Earth's rocks, dissolve in carbonic acid -- a mix of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and rainwater.However, the team found not all sodium comes from this weathering process. ""We've found an additional source of sodium in river waters across the globe,"" said co-author Emily Stevenson. ""That extra sodium is not from weathered silicate rocks as other studies assume, but in fact from very old clays which are being eroded in river catchments.""Tipper and his research group studied eight of the largest river systems on Earth, a mission involving 16 field seasons and thousands of lab analyses in search of where that extra sodium was coming from.They found the answer in a soupy 'gel' of clay and water -- known as the cation exchange pool -- which is carried along by muddy river sediment.The exchange pool is a reactive hive of cations -- positively charged ions like sodium -- which are weakly bonded to clay particles. The cations can easily swap out of the gel for other elements like calcium in river water, a process that can take just a few hours.Although it has been described in soils since the 1950s, the role the exchange pool plays in supplying sodium to rivers has been largely neglected.""The chemical and isotopic makeup of the clays in the exchange pool tell us what they are made of and where they've come from,"" said co-author Alasdair Knight. ""We know that many of the clays carried by these rivers come from ancient sediments, and we suggest that some of the sodium in the river must come from these clays.""The clays were originally formed from continental erosion millions of years ago. On their journey downstream they harvested cations from the surrounding water -- their exchange pool picking up sodium on reaching the sea. Today, after being uplifted from the seafloor, these ancient clays -- together with their sodium -- are now being eroded by modern rivers.This old sodium, which can switch out of the clays in the exchange pool and into river water, has previously been mistaken as the dissolved remnants of modern weathering.""Generating just one data point took a huge amount of work in the lab and we also had to do a lot of maths,"" said Stevenson. ""It's like unmixing a cake, using a forensic approach to isolate key ingredients in the sediments, leaving behind the exchange pool and the clays. People have used the same methods for a really long time -- and they work -- but we've been able to find an extra ingredient that provides the sodium and we need to account for this.""""It's thanks to the hard work of many collaborators and students over many years that our samples had the scope to get to grips with this complex chemical process at a global scale,"" said Tipper.Scientists are now left to puzzle over what else could be absorbing Earth's carbon dioxide over geological time. There are no certain candidates -- but one controversial possibility is that life is removing carbon from the atmosphere. Another theory is that silicate dissolution on the ocean floor or volcanic arcs may be important.

But this architecture is only possible because of a mutually beneficial relationship between the coral and various species of single-celled algae that live inside individual coral cells. These algae convert the Sun's energy into food using a process called photosynthesis and they share some of the nutrients they produce with their coral hosts -- kind of like paying rent.Coral reefs have great ecological, economic, and aesthetic value. Many communities depend on them for food and tourism. However, human activity is putting strain on coral reefs including warming oceans, pollution, and acidification and that affects this symbiotic relationship.""In particular, increasing ocean temperatures can cause coral to lose their algae, a phenomenon called bleaching, because the coral takes on a ghostly white look in the absence of the algae's pigment,"" Cleves explained. ""Without the nutrients provided by photosynthesis, the coral can die of starvation.""In 2018, Cleves headed up the team that demonstrated the first use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing on coral. Now, his teams used CRISPR/Cas9 to identify a gene responsible for regulating coral's response to heat stress.Working first in the anemone Aiptasia, one team -- including Stanford University's Cory Krediet, Erik Lehnert, Masayuki Onishi, and John Pringle -- identified a protein, called Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), which activates many genes associated with the response to heat stress. Anemones are close coral relatives that have similar symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae, but they grow faster and are easier to study. These traits make Aiptasia a powerful model system to study coral biology in the lab.Then another Cleves-led team -- including Stanford University's Amanda Tinoco and John Pringle, Queensland University of Technology's Jacob Bradford and Dimitri Perrin, and Line Bay of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) -- used CRISPR/Cas9 to create mutations in the gene that encodes HSF1 in the coral Acropora millepora, demonstrating its importance for coping with a warming environment.

On Earth, the sun's flares sometimes damage satellites and disrupt radio communications. Elsewhere in the universe, robust stellar flares also have the ability to deplete and destroy atmospheric gases, such as ozone. Without the ozone, harmful levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation can penetrate a planet's atmosphere, thereby diminishing its chances of harboring surface life.By combining 3D atmospheric chemistry and climate modeling with observed flare data from distant stars, a Northwestern-led team discovered that stellar flares could play an important role in the long-term evolution of a planet's atmosphere and habitability.""We compared the atmospheric chemistry of planets experiencing frequent flares with planets experiencing no flares. The long-term atmospheric chemistry is very different,"" said Northwestern's Howard Chen, the study's first author. ""Continuous flares actually drive a planet's atmospheric composition into a new chemical equilibrium.""""We've found that stellar flares might not preclude the existence of life,"" added Daniel Horton, the study's senior author. ""In some cases, flaring doesn't erode all of the atmospheric ozone. Surface life might still have a fighting chance.""The study will be published on Dec. 21 in the journal Horton is an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Chen is a Ph.D. candidate in Horton's Climate Change Research Group and a NASA future investigator.All stars -- including our very own sun -- flare, or randomly release stored energy. Fortunately for Earthlings, the sun's flares typically have a minimal impact on the planet.""Our sun is more of a gentle giant,"" said Allison Youngblood, an astronomer at the University of Colorado and co-author of the study. ""It's older and not as active as younger and smaller stars. Earth also has a strong magnetic field, which deflects the sun's damaging winds.""Unfortunately, most potentially habitable exoplanets aren't as lucky. For planets to potentially harbor life, they must be close enough to a star that their water won't freeze -- but not so close that water vaporizes.""We studied planets orbiting within the habitable zones of M and K dwarf stars -- the most common stars in the universe,"" Horton said. ""Habitable zones around these stars are narrower because the stars are smaller and less powerful than stars like our sun. On the flip side, M and K dwarf stars are thought to have more frequent flaring activity than our sun, and their tidally locked planets are unlikely to have magnetic fields helping deflect their stellar winds.""Chen and Horton previously conducted a study of M dwarf stellar systems' long term climate averages. Flares, however, occur on an hours- or days-long timescales. Although these brief timescales can be difficult to simulate, incorporating the effects of flares is important to forming a more complete picture of exoplanet atmospheres. The researchers accomplished this by incorporating flare data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey, launched in 2018, into their model simulations.If there is life on these M and K dwarf exoplanets, previous work hypothesizes that stellar flares might make it easier to detect. For example, stellar flares can increase the abundance of life-indicating gasses (such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric acid) from imperceptible to detectable levels.""Space weather events are typically viewed as a detriment to habitability,"" Chen said. ""But our study quantitatively shows that some space weather can actually help us detect signatures of important gases that might signify biological processes.""This study involved researchers from a wide range of backgrounds and expertise, including climate scientists, exoplanet scientists, astronomers, theorists and observers.""This project was a result of fantastic collective team effort,"" said Eric T. Wolf, a planetary scientist at CU Boulder and a co-author of the study.

Similar trends were seen geographically, with the time interval between the two life-cycle (phenological) events being greater in trees in warmer areas of Europe.Although leaf unfolding and flowering have both been shown to be happening earlier with climate warming, this is the first large scale study to examine both phenological events together and show that they are not advancing at the same rate in response to climate warming.Leaf unfolding and flowering are key annual events for trees with each signalling the start of growth and reproduction, respectively. The timing of these events is crucial for maximising fitness.""The unequal advances of leaf unfolding and flowering may alter trees' partitioning of resources between growth and reproduction and could leave flowers or leaves vulnerable to late spring frost damage if they appear too early"" said Dr Jian-Guo Huang, the corresponding author of the study. ""This could have impacts on tree species health and further affect ecosystem structure and function.""Species that produce flowers before leaves, like ash, could suffer losses in seed production if flowers were damaged by late spring frost. For species that produce leaves before flowers, like horse chestnut, late spring frost damage to leaves could reduce growth and carbon uptake.Dr Qianqian Ma, lead author of the study said ""The timing of phenological events is very sensitive to environmental factors, with temperature being particularly important in temperate plants. The changes in phenology we observed in our study may affect both growth and reproductive development in tree species and ultimately affect the ecosystem, nutrient cycles and carbon storage.""Tree species have evolved an optimal timing for growth and reproduction based on historic climate conditions. Changes to flowering times could disrupt interactions with pollinators, impacting the survival of both species with knock-on consequences for the ecosystem. Changes to when trees are able to grow in the year can have further consequences to their survival and carbon uptake.The triggering of these phenological events is closely linked to temperature changes in the seasons. ""Plants often require an exposure to chilling temperatures during winter as a cue for rest before the bursting of leaf buds or flowering can be triggered by a sufficient exposure to warmer temperatures in spring."" explained Dr Qianqian Ma.For each tree species, leaf unfolding and flowering have evolved to occur in a predetermined order. Although leaf unfolding occurs first in most species, those pollinated by wind, like alder and ash, flower first so that leaves don't inhibit pollen dispersal.To collect the data on the four tree species, the researchers used the Pan European Phenology (PEP) network. This database contains annul observations of the date when leaves first unfold (or separate for evergreens) and the date when flowers first emerge for tree species across Europe. With this data the authors calculated the time intervals between first leaf date and first flower date between 1950 -- 2013 and assessed this with corresponding temperature data.Dr Qianqian Ma said: ""Using long-term phenological records in Europe, we examined simultaneously the responses of both leaf unfolding and flowering of four common temperate tree species: ash, alder, horse chestnut and scots pine to climate warming.""These trees were chosen to give a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees with different orders of leaf unfolding and flowering.Ideally more species would have been included in the study, but the researchers could only look at tree species with data on first leaf, first flower date and temperature. Only four tree species had sufficient data records over long enough time periods and large enough geographic areas.Dr Jian-Guo Huang said: ""Further studies that simultaneously monitor the timing of phenological events and the allocation of resources within plants are needed to better evaluate the consequences of altered phenology under climate warming.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has shown that climate change is affecting the timing of key annual events for trees, such as leaf unfolding and flowering, at different rates.

The study found that conifers are less likely to regenerate after fires when seedlings face drier climate conditions, especially in low-elevation forests that already experience frequent drought stress. Overall, fewer conifers are expected to grow in California's lower elevations following wildfire due to climate and drought conditions.""We found that when forest fires are followed by drought, tree seedlings have a harder time, and the forest is less likely to come back,"" said Stewart.A UC Davis team collected post-fire recovery data from more than 1,200 study plots in 19 wildfires that burned between 2004 and 2012, as well as 18 years of forest seed production data.

The study is a groundbreaking discovery, as it is the first time since the disease first appeared in 2005 that scientists have been able to link a cause to the condition that affects coastal dolphin communities worldwide. Due to the decreased water salinity brought upon by climate change, the dolphins develop patchy and raised skin lesions across their bodies -- sometimes covering upwards of 70 percent of their skin.","The international study, which can be found here, was co-authored by three internationally respected scientists, from California and Australia:The study, published in This study comes on the heels of significant outbreaks in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas and Australia in recent years.

The increasing severity and frequency of storm events like hurricanes and cyclones, particularly if they are preceded by drought conditions, are dumping unusual volumes of rain that turn coastal waters to freshwater. Freshwater conditions can persist for months, particularly after intense storms such as hurricanes Harvey and Katrina.

Some studies translate this Arctic greening to a greater global carbon uptake. But new research shows that as Earth's climate is changing, increased carbon absorption by plants in the Arctic is being offset by a corresponding decline in the tropics.","""This is a new look at where we can expect carbon uptake to go in the future,"" said scientist Rolf Reichle with the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.Reichle is one of the authors of a study, published Dec. 17 in Together, these provide a more accurate estimate of global ""primary productivity"" -- a measure of how well plants convert carbon dioxide and sunlight to energy and oxygen via photosynthesis, for the time span between 1982 to 2016.Plant productivity in the frigid Arctic landscape is limited by the lengthy periods of cold. As temperatures warm, the plants in these regions have been able to grow more densely and extend their growing season, leading to an overall increase in photosynthetic activity, and subsequently greater carbon absorption in the region over the 35-year time span.However, buildup of atmospheric carbon concentrations has had several other rippling effects. Notably, as carbon has increased, global temperatures have risen, and the atmosphere in the tropics (where plant productivity is limited by the availability of water) has become drier. Recent increases in drought and tree mortality in the Amazon rainforest are one example of this, and productivity and carbon absorption over land near the equator have gone down over the same time period as Arctic greening has occurred, canceling out any net effect on global productivity.Previous model estimates suggested that the increasing productivity of plants in the Arctic could partially compensate for human activities which release atmospheric carbon, like the burning of fossil fuels. But these estimates relied on models that calculate plant productivity based on the assumption that they photosynthesize (convert carbon and light) at a given efficiency rate.In reality, many factors can affect plants' productivity. Including satellite records like those from AVHRR provide scientists with consistent measurments of the global photosynthetic plant cover, and can help account for variable events such as pest outbreaks and deforestation that previous models do not capture. These can impact the global vegetation cover and productivity.""There have been other studies that focused on plant productivity at global scales,"" said Nima Madani from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, (JPL) Pasadena, California, and lead author of the study, which also includes scientists from the University of Montana. ""But we used an improved remote sensing model to have a better insight into changes in ecosystem productivity."" This model uses an enhanced light use efficiency algorithm, which combines multiple satellites' observations of photosynthetic plant cover and variables such as surface meteorology.""The satellite observations are critical especially in regions where our field observations are limited, and that's the beauty of the satellites,"" Madani said. ""That's why we are trying to use satellite remote sensing data as much as possible in our work.""It was only recently that the satellite records began to show these emerging trends in shifting productivity. According to Reichle, ""The modelling and the observations together, what we call data assimilation, is what really is needed."" The satellite observations train the models, while the models can help depict Earth system connections such as the opposing productivity trends observed in the Arctic and tropics.The satellite data also revealed that water limitations and decline in productivity are not confined to the tropics. Recent observations show that the Arctic's greening trend is weakening, with some regions already experiencing browning.""I don't expect that we have to wait another 35 years to see water limitations becoming a factor in the Arctic as well,"" said Reichle. We can expect that the increasing air temperatures will reduce the carbon uptake capacity in the Arctic and boreal biomes in the future. Madani says Arctic boreal zones in the high latitudes that once contained ecosystems constrained by temperature are now evolving into zones limited by water availability like the tropics.These ongoing shifts in productivity patterns across the globe could affect numerous plants and animals, altering entire ecosystems. That can impact food sources and habitats for various species, including endangered wildlife, and human populations.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has revealed that the Arctic's greening trend is weakening and some regions are already experiencing browning.

However, uncertainties remain and current knowledge about ice sheets suggests sea-level rise under continued strong warming could be higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 'likely' range by 2100.The authors of the study, published today in the journal Lead author Professor Martin Siegert, from the Grantham Institute -- Climate Change and Environment at Imperial College London, said: ""Greenhouse gas emissions are still on the rise, and strong heating, of more than 4°C by 2100, is well within the realm of the possible if emissions continue unabated.""Currently, hundreds of millions of people live in regions susceptible to coastal flooding, and the likelihood of even worse flooding will significantly increase with severe sea-level rise. The sea-level rise we have already faced has been somewhat mitigated by flood barriers and other measures, but we are unprepared for higher rates of rise that could overwhelm these measures. If we don't do more to avert dangerous global heating, we may reach a point where we can no longer protect people.""The team reviewed current models of the effect of warming on ice sheets that the IPCC's 2019 report on sea-level rise relies on. For the strong heating scenario of more than 4°C of temperature rise by 2100, the report gave a 'likely' range for sea-level rise of between 0.61 and 1.10 metres above 1950 levels.However, the team's analysis showed that ice sheet models do not include sufficient detail on key processes that may lead to significant mass loss under strong warming, meaning sea level rise above the IPCC's likely range is far more possible than below it.Co-author John Englander, President and Founder of the Rising Seas Institute, said: ""Sea-level rise will be one of the most challenging issues faced by society in the coming decades. We need to recognize that we cannot stand by and wait for clarity about actual sea-level rise to begin planning for it.""Waiting for better confidence in predictions is not a reason to delay building a margin of safety, for example into building codes and zoning, recognising the inevitability of sea-level rise and its catastrophic implications.""There are two main ways sea level can rise substantially at a global level. Throughout the twentieth century, rise has been dominated by thermal expansion -- added heat driving water molecules apart, expanding the volume of the ocean water. In the twenty-first century, however, the second mechanism has become dominant: the addition of water from melting ice sheets and glaciers.While sea-level rise due to thermal expansion can be predicted using relatively simple relationships between the temperature and the expansion, ice sheets and glaciers respond to rising temperatures in complex and interconnected ways that make prediction more fraught.Researchers looking ahead to the next century of climate change and its increasing impact on human society, nature and the environment often look back at previous episodes of natural climate change for clues as to how various earth systems will react.At the end of the last ice age, there is evidence that ice sheets responded to warming by rapidly losing mass at rates that at times were higher than currently observed, leading to several metres of sea-level rise per century.The team say this means current projections of sea-level rise may be underestimates, as the ice sheets may lose mass faster over the coming century than our current models predict.To improve models and predictions, the authors identify key areas of research that are needed to fill in our gaps in knowledge. These include better mapping of the ground beneath glaciers and ice sheets, collection of data at the margin where glaciers meet the ocean, and improved coupling of models of the atmosphere, oceans, and ice sheets.While the network of existing observations of ice sheet dynamics already gives scientists a very strong warning signal and causes for concern, the authors say these improvements could lead to a next-generation 'early warning system' focused on signals of rapid change in sea level, such as increases in ocean water temperature along the margins of ice sheets.Professor Siegert said: ""We already have a good start on an early warning system for dangerous sea-level rise, with satellites, airborne platforms, robotic devices, field investigators, and expert knowledge. While this network is growing and getting stronger, it has major weaknesses at ice-sheet boundaries that require urgent action. We need to develop an array of robotic devices in key parts of Antarctica and Greenland that are most vulnerable and capable of rapid sea-level rise in the future.""",Climate,2020.0,"A study published in the journal Nature warns that global sea level rise could be higher than previously predicted due to the impact of strong global heating on polar ice sheets.

The researchers warn that protecting this is crucial for preventing catastrophic fire.Tropical deforestation exacerbates recurrent peatland fire events in this region. These release globally significant greenhouse gas emissions and produce toxic haze events across South East Asia.An area of tropical forest and peatland larger than the Netherlands has burned in Indonesia in the past five years, according to Greenpeace.Yet the study shows that contiguous tracts of undisturbed forests are not susceptible to burning even under current drought conditions.Dr Tadas Nikonovas of Swansea University, lead author of the research, explained:""Undisturbed tropical rainforests are naturally resistant to fire due to the humid and cool micro-climate they maintain, effectively acting as a fire barrier. Contrary to the widely-held perception that worsening droughts are threatening the remaining rainforests, tropical forests in Indonesia become susceptible to fire only after human disturbance.""However, the study also reveals that currently only a small fraction (~10%) of the remaining total tropical forest cover remains fire-resistant. The rest (~90%) has been severely fragmented or degraded and therefore is no longer able to maintain a fire-resistant microclimate.Importantly, fire-resistant forests now cover only 3% of the region's peatlands, leaving large amounts of climate-critical carbon vulnerable to burning.The authors emphasize that the preventative role tropical forests play against fire is yet another important reason for the preservation and regeneration of the few remaining contiguous tracts of forests.Dr Allan Spessa of Swansea University, the project leader, added:""Protecting tropical forest is critical not only for biodiversity and carbon storage but also for preventing future catastrophic fire episodes. This is true for Indonesia, as well as for tropical forest in Africa and South America.""The research was published in a Nature group journal This study is part of Swansea University-based Towards Fire Early Warning System for Indonesia (ToFEWSI) project.",Climate,2020.0,"A study by Swansea University has found that only 10% of the remaining tropical forest in Indonesia is fire-resistant, which is crucial for preventing catastrophic fires.

299,17-Dec-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201217154051.htm,How climate change is disrupting ecosystems,The world is getting warmer and warmer -- and many organisms native to lower latitudes or elevations are moving higher.,"However, novel organisms moving into a new habitat could disturb the ecological balance which has been established over a long period. Plants and herbivores are characterised by long-term co-evolution, shaping both their geographic distribution and the characteristics that they display in their occupied sites.At higher elevations, this is seen in insect herbivores being generally less abundant and plants in turn being less well defended against herbivores, as a result of lower energy and shorter growing seasons. In contrast, low-elevation plant species defend themselves against more abundant and diverse herbivores, whether by means of spikes, thorns or hair, or by toxic substances. Climate change could disturb this ecological organisation.In an experiment, researchers from ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) and the University of Neuchâtel investigated what could happen if herbivores -- in this case various grasshoppers from middle elevations -- settled in alpine meadows at higher elevations and encountered new plant communities there. The study has just been published in the journal The researchers translocated various grasshopper species from medium altitudes (1,400 metres above sea level) to three alpine grassland sites at elevations of 1,800, 2,070 and 2,270 metres above sea level, where the ecologists placed the grasshoppers in cages. The local grasshoppers had previously been removed from the experimental areas. The experiment was carried out in the Anzeindaz region in the Vaud Alps, Switzerland.In their study, the researchers measured things like how the biomass, structure and composition of the alpine plant communities changed under the influence of the herbivorous insects. The researchers also investigated whether some plant species were more susceptible to herbivory, for instance plants with tougher leaves, or those containing more silica or other constituents such as phenols or tannins.The ecologists discovered that the grasshoppers' feeding behaviour had a clear influence on the vegetation structure and composition of the alpine flora. Alpine communities display clear structure in the organisation of the canopy, with plants with tough leaves at the top, and more shade-tolerant plants with softer leaves at the bottom. But this natural organisation was disturbed, because the translocated grasshoppers preferred to feed on taller and tough alpine plants, which exhibited functional characteristics such as leaf structure, nutrient content, chemical defence, or growth form similar to those of their previous, lower-elevation food plants. As a result, the insects reduced the biomass of dominant tough alpine plants, which in turn favoured the growth of small-stature plant species that herbivores avoid. The overall plant diversity thus increased in the short term.""Immigrant herbivores consume specific plants in their new location and this changes and reorganises the competitive interaction between those alpine plant species,"" says the study's first author, Patrice Descombes. Global warming, for example, could disrupt the ecological balance because mobile animals, including many herbivorous insects, can expand their habitat to higher elevations more rapidly than sedentary plants. Herbivorous insects from lower altitudes could therefore have an easy time in alpine habitats with resident plants that are insufficiently or not at all prepared to defend themselves against those new herbivores. This could change the current structure and functioning of alpine plant communities as a whole. Climate change would thus have an indirect impact on ecosystems, in addition to the direct consequences of rising temperatures.For Loïc Pellisier, Professor of Landscape Ecology at ETH Zurich and WSL, this indirect effect of climate change on ecosystems is one of the most important things to emerge from the study: ""Climate impact research has largely investigated the direct effects of temperature on ecosystems, but these novel interactions that arise between species moving into new habitats could generate important structural modifications. They are important drivers of changed ecosystems in an increasingly warm climate.""With their results, the researchers also want to improve models that have so far only inadequately integrated such processes. They also hope that this will improve the prognosis of how climate change will influence the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide.",Climate,2020.0,"The introduction of new organisms to an ecosystem could disrupt the balance established over a long period, as plants and herbivores have co-evolved to shape their geographic distribution and characteristics.

""You don't even get charismatic zooplankton."" But although anoxic oceans may seem alien to organisms like ourselves that breathe oxygen, they're full of life, she said.These strange ecosystems are expanding, thanks to climate change -- a development that is of concern for fisheries and anyone who relies on oxygen-rich oceans. But what piques Raven's interest is the changing chemistry of the oceans -- the Earth's largest carbon sink -- and how it could move carbon from the atmosphere to long-term reservoirs like rocks.""What happens to our carbon cycle as we get these large areas of the ocean that are oxygen-free?"" she said. This question was central to research conducted by Raven and colleagues Rick Keil (University of Washington) and Samuel Webb (Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory) in a paper published in the journal In oxygen-rich oceans, carbon is moved around largely by food web processes that begin with carbon dioxide-fixing phytoplankton that photosynthesize at the water's surface.""Most of the time they just get eaten by zooplankton,"" Raven said. But if they aren't eaten by larger animals, they head to the depths where they respire carbon dioxide and excrete organic carbon.""It's like a spinning wheel -- COIn the absence of zooplankton and fish, however, more of the sinking organic carbon can survive and be deposited at depth, she said. In fact, sediments under these anoxic zones generally have more organic carbon deposits than their oxygen-rich counterparts. But, according to the researchers, we lack a ""full mechanistic understanding"" of how this occurs.""It's been a bit of a mystery,"" Raven said.The team did have a clue in the form of a hypothesis formed about a decade ago by University of Southern Denmark geologist Don Canfield and colleagues.""They put out this idea that maybe inside of these zones, microbes are still eating organic carbon, but respiring sulfate,"" Raven said. Called ""cryptic sulfur cycling,"" the idea was somewhat difficult to accept largely because the products of this microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) were difficult to detect, and because other compounds in the area, such as nitrates, were more energetically favorable to metabolize.However, according to the study, ""there is emerging molecular and geochemical evidence that suggests MSR may occur in (oxygen-deficient zones) despite plentiful dissolved nitrate.""The researchers tested whether this enigmatic process might be hiding inside of large (>1mm), fast-sinking organic particles by collecting particles from the Eastern Tropical North Pacific oxygen-deficient zone, roughly located off the northwestern coast of Mexico.""It really is just this polymeric, sticky stuff,"" Raven said of the aggregations of mostly dead phytoplankton, fecal matter, other small organisms and bits of sand and clay that get glued together in a ""fluffy"" matrix. Collection of these particles is itself an accomplishment for researchers combing the vast oceans for relatively small, diffuse particles.""My colleagues from the University of Washington had this collection device that was really the thing that made it possible to do this,"" she said. The collected particles were sent to the Stanford Synchotron Radiation Lightsource for analysis.Results of the analysis, such as evidence of the production of organic sulfur within the samples, demonstrate what Raven calls a ""pickling"" of the dead phytoplankton, as they sink through the anoxic area.""Phytoplankton grow in the surface ocean, but due to gravity, they sink,"" she said. As they fall through the anoxic region, these organic aggregates undergo sulfurization, which has the effect of shielding the carbon at their core from enzymes or other substances that would otherwise wear them away.""Even when it gets to the sediment, bacteria there can't eat these organic particles,"" noted Raven. And just like the pickles we know and love, the preservation process makes the organic particle resistant to bacteria, she said, which could explain why more organic carbon is found in the sediments below anoxic ocean zones.Sulfurization of organic carbon particles in anoxic ocean zones, while newly confirmed in modern-day oceans, is actually an ancient process, Raven explained.""It's the same process that can also make petroleum,"" she said, pointing out that where oilbeds are found, so, too, is sulfur. This process may have been widespread during the Cretaceous period (145.5 to 65.5 million years ago), when the Earth was consistently tropical and the ocean was subject to geologic and mass extinction events that resulted in the burial of massive amounts of carbon, and anoxic waters throughout the Atlantic.""What we didn't know is whether this was also going on in these less extreme modern environments,"" Raven said.What remains to be seen is how these growing oxygen depleted zones will interact with climate change.""Potentially as these zones expand, there could be a negative feedback -- more CO",Climate,2020.0,"Anoxic oceans, which are expanding due to climate change, are full of life and are of concern for fisheries and anyone who relies on oxygen-rich oceans.

The sensors can identify in real-time these accumulations while calculating the rate of melting. This is crucial data for aviation, for keeping flights on time, and renewable energy applications, says Zarifi.""Power generation output of wind turbines diminishes as a result of ice accumulations,"" he adds. ""So, the industry sees great promise in sensing and de-icing solutions that can mitigate those reductions in efficiency.""Zarifi says the patented sensor, which includes a protective layer, is now being tested by the aviation industry through a rigorous approval process. This needs to be done before it can become a permanent fixture on aircraft. He notes that recently announced funding from the Department of National Defense will enable his team to continue to improve the sensor's capabilities.Zarifi is also collaborating with a number of wind turbine companies to adapt the sensors into wind farms. The wind farm application is a slightly more straightforward proposition, he says, because the sensors can be mounted at the same altitude of the blades without having to be mounted to the blades -- this removes certain calculation variables that are related to motion.In the midst of these breakthroughs, the researchers have uncovered another first when it comes to ice sensing technology. Their latest innovation can sense salty ice, which freezes at colder temperatures. Interest in understanding and monitoring saltwater ice formation is increasing due to issues caused by saltwater ice on oil rigs and marine infrastructure. Zarifi and his team at OMEGA Lab are working towards the introduction of microwave/radar-based technology to address this challenge.By incorporating an antenna into the sensor, the results can be shared in real-time with the operator in order to address the build-up.Zarifi says his team is as excited as the industry partners to see how their microwave and antenna, which have proven to be durable and robust, can be modified for various applications including ice and moisture sensing.The research was funded by a National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant, Mitacs Accelerate Grant, and grants from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Canadian Department of National Defense.

But scientists at the University of California, Davis, have found that wine grape varieties from regions that are more prone to stress have traits that could help them cope with climate change.","The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Botany, finds that varieties that produce their best wines in warmer, drier regions have traits that conserve water, helping the vines extend their water resources to last over the growing season.""The relationships between grape varieties and regions have historically been based on wine, without considering traits that affect drought or heat tolerance,"" said lead author Megan Bartlett, an assistant professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology. ""These findings show these varieties could be more resilient to climate change than expected.""The study examined how grapevines regulate their stomata -- tiny pores found on the surface of leaves that allow plants to take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and expel oxygen. The regulation of these stomata affects how much CO2 is available for photosynthesis and how much water evaporates from the leaves. Grapevines must choose between opening their stomata to take in CO2 to produce sugars for growth and ripening or closing the stomata to reduce evaporation and water stress.A little water stress improves wine by concentrating the flavors and aromas in the grapes. But too much will prevent grapes from achieving their ideal balance of sugars, acids and tannins, creating flat, uninteresting wines.The researchers examined traits for 34 varieties and used a global database of planting areas in different wine regions to define the associations between varieties and regions. The study focused on European regions, where irrigation is banned or restricted, to directly capture the stress imposed by the local climate.The study found that the varieties grown in regions more likely to experience water stress, such as Italy's Sangiovese and Montepulciano, kept their stomata more closed than varieties like Sauvignon Blanc from cooler, more humid regions.""This strategy would help these varieties save water,"" said study co-author Gabriela Sinclair, a research technician in the Bartlett lab.Bartlett cautions that these traits may have unintended consequences as heatwaves become more extreme. Grapevines use evaporation to cool the leaves, the same way we cool ourselves by sweating. Restricting evaporation too tightly could allow leaves to reach damaging temperatures, reducing their future photosynthesis and limiting the sugars available for ripening.""We have more work to do to understand how these traits will affect grapevines as the climate reaches new extremes,"" said Bartlett.

Climate change has meant that spring arrives earlier, but winters have become far more treacherous for Arctic animals that overwinter there, with more rain and ice.","So what about birds that don't overwinter in the Arctic, but nest and raise young there? Researchers have spent nearly three decades collecting data on a group of barnacle geese that migrate to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard to see how the geese respond to environmental changes overall.In one study they found that earlier springs linked with climate change meant better conditions for the geese, but that these benefits were cancelled out by an increase in numbers of hungry foxes -- a precarious balance that could change depending on future conditions.Now, researchers have looked at the actual physical condition of the geese as their numbers have skyrocketed at their overwintering grounds in the UK. There are more than 40,000 birds now compared to just 300 individuals in the 1940s, when the birds were still hunted in both UK and elsewhere.More birds, however, means more competition for food in their summer nesting areas on Svalbard.There's so much competition, in fact, that the average body weight of the birds has dropped by 10 per cent in the last three decades. In wild animals, reduced body weight often means reduced condition and a low ability to reproduce or survive. The question the researchers have tried to answer in a new publication is, does this really matter?The answer, it seems, is no. Not yet.Kate Layton-Matthews completed her PhD dissertation at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics on the geese earlier this year.She worked with a team of researchers from NTNU, the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, the University of Sheffield in the UK and the Norwegian Polar Institute in Tromsø on modelling a long-term population study on the barnacle goose.Barnacle geese breeding on Svalbard make a 3000 km long trip every spring to their Arctic breeding grounds from their overwintering areas in Scotland. That in itself requires a great deal of energy, but the birds also still need to be in good enough condition when they arrive in the Arctic to lay eggs and raise their young.As the team of researchers looked at their decades of data, they detected the 10 per cent drop in the birds' body weight.So Layton-Matthews used a complex statistical model that could digest information on body condition, reproduction and survival of the geese since 1990. The model allowed her to see if the net effect of lower body weights was actually affecting the ability of the birds to survive and reproduce, and ultimately if this has caused changes in goose population numbers.""We have this kind of underlying expectation that body condition is so important for herbivores, and especially in the Arctic that your body condition can limit reproduction and probability of survival. So body weight, or body condition, could limit if they manage to have offspring or not, and also whether, especially young geese, survive their first migration,"" she said.Surprisingly, however, although changes in body condition do influence reproduction and survival of young geese somewhat, this did not translate into noticeable effects on population numbers.""We were expecting that something so important at the individual level would have big impact on the population, but it doesn't,"" she said.The researchers say this is because it's overridden by other important environmental effects that don't affect the geese through body condition, such as the positive impact of earlier springs on gosling production, and the negative effect of Arctic foxes on goslings' survival.However, because there is obviously a limit to how skinny the geese can be and still perform well if their summer habitat continues to degrade, it's likely to restrict population growth at some point.The good news, Layton-Matthews said, is that this still shows the geese populations are more resilient to changes in habitat quality and body condition than researchers previously thought.The increase in goose numbers in their wintering areas has led to some places, such as Ireland, to allow the birds to be hunted again. It's also been debated whether barnacle geese hunting should be allowed on Svalbard.But Layton-Matthews says history has shown that there's a potential risk if the overwintering birds are hunted too heavily.""If we start hunting a population that is really sensitive to hunting and quite sensitive to climate change, as we know this population is, we need to be very careful about the hunting levels being set,"" she said. ""If they're going to introduce hunting at wintering or breeding grounds, we need to monitor and account for the other processes going on, notably climate change, so that they can set sensible quotas that won't harm the overall population.""Maarten J.J.E. Loonen started studying barnacle geese on Svalbard three decades ago to determine how the breeding period would limit population size after the growth in population numbers due to changes on the wintering grounds. Winter populations did well because hunting was banned in Scotland in 1950, and the grasslands where they grazed were fertilized.""In 1990 we thought that the Arctic would not change and Svalbard, being an island, would result in an increase of competition among the geese and a decrease breeding success,"" Loonen said. ""In poor years, we knew that gosling growth slowed down and as a consequence these geese became smaller adults. But after thirty years of data collection, this paper shows that there is no effect of declines on population size yet.""",Climate,2020.0,"A study of barnacle geese that migrate to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard has found that a 10% drop in their body weight over the past three decades has not yet affected their ability to survive and reproduce.

Global warming is likely to cause global atmospheric circulation to change and progressively revert to a situation similar to that of 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. This is the conclusion of a study undertaken by a research team led by Dr. Michael Deininger, the results of which have been published in ","At the Institute of Geosciences at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), Deininger investigated how regional climate systems have changed since the beginning of the current interglacial period some 10,000 years ago and what conclusions can be drawn from this. To do this, the paleoclimatologist looked at data for rainfall time series recorded in various climate archives. ""We were able to accurately reconstruct summer precipitation in the monsoon regions in Africa and South America, compare this data with changes in precipitation in the northern mid-latitudes, and relate this to changes in temperature,"" Deininger explained. The study also involved scientists from Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Ireland, Austria, and South Africa.As the Earth is heated stronger at the equator than at the poles due to the differing distribution of solar radiation, a temperature gradient develops which, to put it in simple terms, causes atmospheric circulation to transport energy toward the poles. Changes to this solar radiation-related temperature difference will in turn influence the atmospheric circulation and thus also regional precipitation patterns.The new study shows that over the past 10,000 years, changes to regional precipitation in the northern latitudes, Africa, and South America have more or less been synchronous. ""We argue that these regional climate variations are connected and that they are mainly caused by alterations to solar radiation and the associated temperature differences between the tropics and polar regions,"" stated Deininger.The researchers involved in the study were particularly interested in the question of whether it is possible to learn from the past to benefit the future. With the current level of global warming, the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles is being reduced -- especially due to the fact that warming in the Arctic has a particularly marked effect. This can weaken the westerly winds in mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, cause a weaker South American monsoon and a stronger African monsoon, while at the same time lead to lower precipitation levels in the summer rainfall zone of Southeast Africa. The consequences of this could be shifts in regional rainfall patterns, potentially causing droughts in some areas and flooding in others. ""In future, we need to recognize the fundamental role the variation in temperature difference plays in controlling our climate system,"" concluded Dr. Michael Deininger.",Climate,2020.0,"A study by the Institute of Geosciences at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz investigated changes in regional climate systems over the past 10,000 years.

The reason: in the winter, there were virtually no biologists on site to watch for the animals. Experts from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) have now used permanently installed underwater microphones, which have been recording for the past nine years, to successfully gather and analyse whale observation data from the Weddell Sea. The audio recordings offer unique insights into the lives of humpback whales and Antarctic minke whales. They show e.g. that there are most likely two humpback whale populations in the Weddell Sea, both of which avoid the sea ice and call or sing most frequently in the autumn. In contrast, Antarctic minke whales primarily live in ice-covered regions and produce their characteristic quacking sounds in the winter, as the researchers report in two studies recently published in the online journal ","Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) are still a mystery to marine biologists, who don't know how many of these whales there are, or where exactly they live, mate and give birth to their calves. A few years ago, however, it was discovered that Antarctic minke whales produce certain characteristic sounds. These calls, which often sound a bit like the quacking of a duck, provide incontrovertible proof of the presence of the small whales, which measure up to eleven metres in length.AWI biologist Diego Filun and his team are now using these sounds in the first-ever comprehensive, long-term observation of Antarctic minke whales in the Weddell Sea. ""We've been monitoring our underwater microphones for nine years. They were deployed at 21 points throughout the Weddell Sea and along the prime meridian, allowing us to record the whales' acoustic activities in regions where research vessels rarely venture. Thanks to the recordings, we now finally understand in what parts of the Weddell Sea the minke whales prefer to be at different times of year, and know that at least some of them stay there for the winter and don't migrate to warmer waters,"" Filun explains.The recordings from 2008 to 2016 show that, in summer and winter alike, Antarctic minke whales tend to stay in those regions of the Weddell Sea that are covered with sea ice. Yet the frequency of their calls appears to change with the season: they can be heard far more often in the autumn and winter months (April to October) than in the summer months (December to March). In addition, the acoustic observations call into question certain previous assumptions: ""On aerial survey flights over the Weddell Sea in the summer, minke whales were primarily sighted near the sea-ice edge and less frequently in areas with thick sea ice. But our audio recordings showed just the opposite: the minke whales were rarely found in the marginal ice zone, and much more often under thick ice -- most likely in an attempt to avoid their archenemies, killer whales,"" Filun reports.In contrast, the humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of the Weddell Sea don't seek shelter below the ice. On the contrary! As the second hydroacoustic study, led by AWI biologist Elena Schall, determined, the baleen whales avoid ice-covered regions. Instead, they venture to the north of the ice edge on the hunt for Antarctic krill, which can be found in especially large swarms in the Weddell Sea and waters north of it.""Our audio recordings from 2013 indicate that at least two humpback whale populations come to the Weddell Sea in summer to build up their fat reserves. Whales from South Africa seem to go hunting at the eastern edge, near the prime meridian. But humpbacks from South America tend to stay in the northern coastal waters of the Antarctic Peninsula, and can be heard until later in the year than their counterparts to the east,"" explains first author Elena Schall.In both groups, some of the animals don't begin the long trek to the north at summer's end, and instead overwinter in the ice-free regions of the Weddell Sea. At the same time, the recordings indicate that, in the summer, the humpbacks move southward as the ice retreats, but only go as far as is absolutely necessary to find sufficient food.""If we want to protect the unique biotic communities of the Weddell Sea in the long term, we need to know as precisely as possible how many baleen whales come to the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in search of food, what regions they hunt in, whether they overwinter there, and how much krill is needed for the whales to find sufficient food. In this regard, long-term acoustic observations are a vital tool, because they offer us a far more detailed picture of life below the water than the handful of scientific whale sightings alone,"" says Dr Ilse van Opzeeland, an AWI biologist and co-author of both studies.The team now hopes that the findings from the new studies will be taken into account in future discussions on the establishment of a marine protected area in the Weddell Sea, especially in terms of limiting krill fishing to ensure that there is still enough food for all marine fauna.In the meantime, the experts will continue to analyse their wealth of underwater recordings. First of all, they'll seek to determine the purpose of Antarctic minke whales' unusual 'quacking'; in addition, there are initial indications that the humpback whales' recorded songs and calls could be used to discover why they leave the Weddell Sea much earlier or later than normal in certain summers, or the conditions under which they sometimes don't return to the Weddell Sea at all when winter ends. Understanding these behavioural patterns would mean a major step forward for the AWI's marine biologists.",Climate,2020.0,"Marine biologists are using characteristic sounds produced by Antarctic minke whales to study their behavior and movements in the Weddell Sea.

The scientists found that steep slopes in the bedrock under the ice form stabilizing areas the researchers termed ""knickpoints"" that prevent coastal thinning from reaching further inland.The findings were published Dec. 11 in the journal ""Thinning in glaciers originates at the edge of the ice, and makes its way inland,"" said lead author Denis Felikson, a NASA research scientist. ""When the thinning reaches a knickpoint that is steep enough, it's halted.""However, in regions where the flat bedrock offers no such protection and knickpoints are absent, runaway thinning can reach far into the ice sheet and eat away at previously unaffected ice and contribute to sea level rise.Coauthor Ginny Catania, a professor of glaciology at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences, said that most glaciers are thinning as scientists expect in a warming climate, but not at the same rates or amounts. The variability makes it more difficult to predict how quickly sea levels will rise as the planet gets hotter.""Some glaciers are thinning right next to others that are thickening,"" she said. ""Until now we didn't know how to explain such variability. Denis' research has provided a framework for that understanding, and it's very likely that all of the variability we observe in outlet glaciers is linked to variability in the bed topography between glaciers.""The researchers use the term knickpoints to describe steep slopes in the bedrock because of their similarities to river knickpoints -- places that often form waterfalls or rapids. Like a waterfall, glaciers pour over the knickpoints, creating a physical barrier that prevents changes happening downstream near the coast from reaching further upstream.Greenland's ice sheet covers an area twice the size of Texas. The barrier effect of knickpoints is important because warmer ocean currents are one of the principal reasons Greenland's glaciers are losing mass more quickly than they were 20 years ago.The study gives scientists a better understanding of how the loss of ice will play out as the world gets hotter and can also focus scientific resources on learning more about the glaciers most likely to contribute to sea level rise.Felikson began the research while earning a Ph.D. at the Jackson School working with Catania and coauthor Tim Bartholomaus (now at the University of Idaho) at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG). By comparing the start-stop motion of glacial creep to congested traffic, the UTIG group had shown that a glacier's shape controls the spread of thinning in a 2017 The current paper builds on that research but extends the analysis from 16 to 141 (the majority) of Greenland's outlet glaciers, and in doing so, revealed the armoring effect of glacial knickpoints.The research shows that glacial knickpoints are surprisingly prevalent. Although that might be good news, the research also revealed vulnerability in northwest Greenland, an overlooked region of the ice sheet.""The glaciers in this region could be important over the next 100 years because the relatively flat bedrock beneath them means they can transfer thinning much further into the interior of the ice sheet than some of the larger glaciers in mountainous topography,"" Felikson said.Catania said this means that sea levels will rise regardless.""You're still going to drain the ice sheet you're just going to do so through a different area than we thought,"" she said.The research team agreed that investigations of the bedrock near the coast is urgently required to learn how effective knickpoints are at holding back coastal warming, as is investigation of unprotected glaciers. Catania and Felikson have already proposed an early warning system that will use machine learning to watch for instability in glaciers identified by the knickpoint analysis.Felikson is a research scientist at Universities Space Research Association and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

An abrupt transition to low-energy subtidal lime mudstone records widespread marine flooding associated with a long-lived regional rise in sea level, they concluded. Relative sea level rise, they added, resulted from long-term tectonically controlled subsidence.The combined evidence from paleontology, ichnology and process sedimentology ""provides a clear record of freshwater input and brackish water conditions due to mixing of freshwater and seawater in a humid climate with high annual precipitation,"" O'Connell's team wrote.The second paper, published Dec. 5 and led by Gardner, documents tidal sediments of the same age on the opposite side of the same ancient tidal strait. The sediments accumulated where strong daily reversing currents swept north and south along the axis of the tidal strait, driving migration of large subtidal dunes and depositing large scale cross-bedded carbonate sands.The authors argue that the migrating dune bedforms could not have formed by tidal like processes in a lake, as some scientists have proposed. The team's results indicate that, after late Miocene to early Pliocene deposition, the sediments were uplifted to elevations up to 330 meters above sea level in the Chocolate Mountains, as a result of long-term crustal strain related to motion on the San Andreas fault.""Taken together, our new papers provide conclusive evidence that the southern Bouse Formation formed in and around the margins of a marine tidal strait that filled the lower Colorado River valley prior to arrival of the modern river system,"" said Dorsey, a professor in the UO's Department of Earth Sciences.A map of the southern Bouse tidal seaway, reconstructed with data from both studies, shows that desert communities from Blythe to Palo Verde, California, were submerged under shallow seas with strong fluctuating tidal currents during late Miocene to early Pliocene time.The Miocene, a geological epoch, lasted from 23 million years ago to 5.3 million years ago; the Pliocene occurred between 5.3 million and 2.6 million years ago.Co-authors with O'Connell and Dorsey on the first paper were Stephen T. Hasiotis, a geologist at the University of Kansas, and Ashleigh Hood at the University of Melbourne.In 2018, another Dorsey-led paper in the journal ",Climate,2020.0,"Two new studies, led by researchers at the University of Oregon, provide evidence that the lower valley of the Colorado River was submerged under shallow seas with strong tidal currents around 5 to 6 million years ago.

The studies, which were funded by the National Science Foundation, were published in the journal Geosphere.

It's as much fact as sentiment. Trees really do link the ground to the sky by exchanging energy and matter between the soil and the atmosphere. Researchers believe that understanding this connection could provide both a wealth of scientific insight into ecosystems and practical applications that address challenges such as water resource conservation and management.,"A recent study led by UC Santa Barbara's Marc Mayes investigates how patterns in tree water loss to the atmosphere, tracked with satellite imagery, relates to groundwater supplies. The results validate at landscape-wide scales ideas that scientists have proposed based on decades of research in labs and greenhouses. What's more, the techniques lend themselves to an accurate, efficient way of monitoring groundwater resources over large areas. The findings appear in the journal For all their diversity, most plants have a very simple game plan. Using energy from sunlight, they combine water from the ground with carbon dioxide from the air to produce sugars and oxygen. During photosynthesis, plants open small pores in their leaves to take in COJust like evaporating sweat cools down our own bodies, the evapotranspiration from the trees cools down the forest. With the proper understanding and technology, scientists can use thermal image data from satellites as well as manned and unmanned aircraft to understand the relationship between plants and groundwater: cooler temperatures correlate with more evapotranspiration.""The core hypothesis of this paper is that you can use relationships between plant water use [as] measured by [satellite] image data, and climate data including air temperature and rainfall, to gauge the availability of, and changes in, groundwater resources,"" said Mayes, an Earth scientist and remote sensing expert based at the university's Earth Research Institute (ERI).Mayes and his colleagues focused on the flora of dryland rivers -- those in deserts and Mediterranean climates. Throughout these regions, many plants have evolved adaptations that minimize water loss, like slow growth, water retention or boom-bust lifecycles. However, plants that dominate river channels -- species like sycamore, cottonwood and willows -- evolved to take advantage of the surplus groundwater the habitat offers relative to the surrounding landscape.""Rather than slowing down its water use when water becomes scarce, this vegetation will basically drink itself to death,"" Mayes said. This makes it a good window into conditions below the surface.The team used satellite-based thermal imaging to look at temperatures across the San Pedro River corridor in southern Arizona. On cloud-free days the satellites can gather data on surface temperatures at high resolution over large areas of land. By comparing the temperatures along the river to those in nearby, more sparsely vegetated areas, the researchers were able to determine the extent of evapotranspiration along different parts of the river at different times. They found that it correlated with air temperature in water-rich environments and with rainfall in water-scarce environments.The findings support recent advances in our understanding of plant water use. The hotter and drier the air, the stronger it pulls water from the leaves, and the more water the plant uses. Consequently, Mayes and his colleagues expected to see evapotranspiration vary with air temperature as long as the stream has abundant groundwater for the plants to draw on.On the other hand, where groundwater is scarce, plants will close the openings on their leaves to avoid water loss; it's more important to avoid drying out than to take advantage of the extra sunshine on a warm day. As a result, evapotranspiration will correlate much more strongly with rainfall and streamflow, which increases the supply of water to trees through their roots.Scientists had demonstrated the predictable effect of evapotranspiration in lowering surface temperatures in lab and small field experiments. However, this is the first study to demonstrate its impact over large areas. The technology that made this possible has matured only within the past five years.""This remote sensing method shows great promise for identifying the relevant climatic versus other controls on tree growth and health, even within narrow bands of vegetation along rivers,"" said coauthor Michael Singer, a researcher at ERI and lead investigator on the project that funded Mayes' work.In fact, these ecosystems are vitally important to the southwestern U.S. ""Despite taking up about 2% of the landscape, over 90% of the biodiversity in the Southwest relies on these ecosystems,"" said coauthor Pamela Nagler, a research scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Southwest Biological Science Center.The same techniques used in the paper could be applied to the perennial challenge of groundwater monitoring. In fact, this idea helped motivate the study in the first place. ""It's very hard to monitor groundwater availability and change[s] in groundwater resources at the really local scales that matter,"" Mayes said. ""We're talking about farmers' fields or river corridors downstream of new housing developments.""Monitoring wells are effective, but provide information only for one point on the map. What's more, they are expensive to drill and maintain. Flux towers can measure the exchange of gasses between the surface and the atmosphere, including water vapor. But they have similar drawbacks to wells in terms of cost and scale. Scientists and stakeholders want reliable, cost-effective methods to monitor aquifers that provide wide coverage at the same time as high resolution. It's a tall order.While it may not be quite as precise as a well, remote thermal imaging from aircraft and satellites can check off all of these boxes. It offers wide coverage and high resolution using existing infrastructure. And although it works only along stream corridors, ""an inordinate amount of agricultural land and human settlements in dry places ends up being where the water is, along stream paths,"" Mayes said.The idea is to look for shifts in the relationships of evapotranspiration to climate variables over time. These changes will signal a switch between water-rich and water-poor conditions. ""Detecting that signal over large areas could be a valuable early warning sign of depleting groundwater resources,"" Mayes said. The technique could inform monitoring and pragmatic decision-making on groundwater use.This study is part of a larger Department of Defense (DOD) project aimed at understanding how vulnerable riverine habitats are to droughts on DOD bases in dryland regions of the U.S. ""We are using multiple methods to understand when and why these plants become stressed due to lack of water,"" said Singer, the project's lead scientist. ""[We hope] this new knowledge can support the management of these sensitive ecological biomes, particularly on military bases in dryland regions, where these pristine habitats support numerous threatened and endangered species.""Mayes added, ""What's coming down the pipe is a whole ensemble of work looking at ecosystem responses to water scarcity and water stress across space and time that informs ways we both understand ecosystem response and also improve the monitoring.""",Climate,2020.0,"A study led by UC Santa Barbara's Marc Mayes has found that patterns in tree water loss to the atmosphere, tracked with satellite imagery, can be used to monitor groundwater supplies over large areas.

However, fueling economic development with coal, oil, or gas risks locking societies into a fossil-fuel burning infrastructure in the long-term, the authors caution.""People in less wealthy countries are often motivated to use fossil fuels to drive their economic development and meet basic human needs,"" said lead author, Carnegie's Lei Duan. He continued, ""While the direct climate effects from emissions from poor people will be minor, the world will care what kinds of energy systems they have as they increase their wealth.""More than half of the world's population resides in countries that have a per capita gross domestic product of less than $10,000 per year. But these nations produce less than 7 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.So Duan, Caldeira, and Juan Moreno-Cruz of the University of Waterloo set out to determine the consequences to the climate if only richer countries focused on decarbonization and developing countries delayed emissions cuts until they achieved economic stability.They tested several future scenarios in which carbon emissions were cut only when countries reached specified levels of economic growth.If every country in the world started to cut emissions by 2 percent annually in 2020, the world would warm to the climate-stabilizing Paris Agreement goal of 2 degrees Celsius over the pre-industrial era. However, Duan explained, ""we determined that if decarbonization began only when a country reached a $10,000 per capita GDP, it would cause less than 0.3 degrees Celsius additional warming. This demonstrates that the onus of fighting climate change really falls on the shoulders of more developed nations.""This is, in part, because developing nations tend to prioritize low-cost and easy to operate energy sources. In fact, the authors said that the biggest risk to allowing these countries to delay emissions cuts would be the possibility of their constructing more-permanent fossil-fuel-burning infrastructure that would be too costly to eliminate.In fact, last year, a study on which Caldeira was a coauthor determined that the world's power plants, boilers, furnaces, vehicles, and other fossil fuel technology must be retired early to meet the Paris Agreement goal.""My professional career has been focused on addressing the climate problem, but I could do that because I had access to food, and shelter, and education, and energy and a thousand other things,"" Caldeira said. ""If I didn't have those things, I would be focused on getting those things. We in the rich world can't fault anybody for trying to meet basic needs. We need to be thinking about ways to help people meet their basic needs today, while we help them and ourselves to transition to an energy system that does not use the sky as a waste dump.""",Climate,2020.0,"Countries with low per capita incomes can limit their contribution to global warming to 0.3 degrees Celsius with careful planning, according to a study by Carnegie’s Lei Duan and Ken Caldeira, alongside Juan Moreno-Cruz of the University of Waterloo.

The huge machines churn through millions of calculations to solve equations to predict temperature, wind, rainfall and other weather events. A forecast's combined need for speed and accuracy taxes even the most modern computers.","The future could take a radically different approach. A collaboration between the University of Washington and Microsoft Research shows how artificial intelligence can analyze past weather patterns to predict future events, much more efficiently and potentially someday more accurately than today's technology.The newly developed global weather model bases its predictions on the past 40 years of weather data, rather than on detailed physics calculations. The simple, data-based A.I. model can simulate a year's weather around the globe much more quickly and almost as well as traditional weather models, by taking similar repeated steps from one forecast to the next, according to a paper published this summer in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.""Machine learning is essentially doing a glorified version of pattern recognition,"" said lead author Jonathan Weyn, who did the research as part of his UW doctorate in atmospheric sciences. ""It sees a typical pattern, recognizes how it usually evolves and decides what to do based on the examples it has seen in the past 40 years of data.""Although the new model is, unsurprisingly, less accurate than today's top traditional forecasting models, the current A.I. design uses about 7,000 times less computing power to create forecasts for the same number of points on the globe. Less computational work means faster results.That speedup would allow the forecasting centers to quickly run many models with slightly different starting conditions, a technique called ""ensemble forecasting"" that lets weather predictions cover the range of possible expected outcomes for a weather event -- for instance, where a hurricane might strike.""There's so much more efficiency in this approach; that's what's so important about it,"" said author Dale Durran, a UW professor of atmospheric sciences. ""The promise is that it could allow us to deal with predictability issues by having a model that's fast enough to run very large ensembles.""Co-author Rich Caruana at Microsoft Research had initially approached the UW group to propose a project using artificial intelligence to make weather predictions based on historical data without relying on physical laws. Weyn was taking a UW computer science course in machine learning and decided to tackle the project.""After training on past weather data, the A.I. algorithm is capable of coming up with relationships between different variables that physics equations just can't do,"" Weyn said. ""We can afford to use a lot fewer variables and therefore make a model that's much faster.""To merge successful A.I. techniques with weather forecasting, the team mapped six faces of a cube onto planet Earth, then flattened out the cube's six faces, like in an architectural paper model. The authors treated the polar faces differently because of their unique role in the weather as one way to improve the forecast's accuracy.The authors then tested their model by predicting the global height of the 500 hectopascal pressure, a standard variable in weather forecasting, every 12 hours for a full year. A recent paper, which included Weyn as a co-author, introduced WeatherBench as a benchmark test for data-driven weather forecasts. On that forecasting test, developed for three-day forecasts, this new model is one of the top performers.The data-driven model would need more detail before it could begin to compete with existing operational forecasts, the authors say, but the idea shows promise as an alternative approach to generating weather forecasts, especially with a growing amount of previous forecasts and weather observations.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers from the University of Washington and Microsoft Research have developed a global weather model that uses artificial intelligence to predict future events.

After probing a persistent error in widely used models, researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory estimate that California will likely experience drier winters in the future than projected by some climate models, meaning residents may see less spring runoff, higher spring temperatures, and an increased risk of wildfire in coming years.","Earth scientist Lu Dong, who led the study alongside atmospheric scientist Ruby Leung, presented her findings at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 1, and will answer questions virtually on Wednesday, Dec. 16.As imperfect simulations of vastly complex systems, today's climate models have biases and errors. When new model generations are refined and grow increasingly accurate, some biases are reduced while others linger. One such long-lived bias in many models is the misrepresentation of an important circulation feature called the intertropical convergence zone, commonly known as the ITCZ.The ITCZ marks an area just north of the Earth's equator where northeast trade winds from the northern hemisphere clash with southeast trade winds from the southern hemisphere. Strong sunlight and warm water heat the air here, energizing it along with the moisture it holds to move upward.As the air rises, it expands and cools. Condensing moisture provides more energy to produce thunderstorms with intense rainfall. From space, one can even see a thick band of clouds, unbroken for hundreds of miles as they move about the region.""The ITCZ produces the strongest, long line of persistent convection in the world,"" said Dong. ""It can influence the global water cycle and climate over much of the Earth,"" including, she added, California's climate.Many climate models mistakenly depict a double ITCZ: two bands appearing in both hemispheres instead of one, which imbues uncertainty in model projections. Scientists refer to this as the double-ITCZ bias. Variations in the wind and pressure systems that influence the ITCZ add to that uncertainty.""There's a lot of uncertainty in California's future precipitation,"" said Dong, who described climate models that project a range of winter wetness in the state averaged over multiple years, from high increases to small decreases. ""We want to know where this uncertainty comes from so we can better project future changes in precipitation.""To peer through the effect of the double-ITCZ bias and create more accurate projections, Dong and atmospheric scientist Ruby Leung analyzed data from nearly 40 climate models, uncovering statistical and mechanistic links between the bias and the models' outputs. The lion's share of the models they analyzed projected a sharpening of California's seasonal precipitation cycle, bringing wetter winters and drier fall and spring seasons.Soft, white snow rests on either side of a California waterway. Winter precipitation includes more than just rain, encompassing snowpack in mountainous areas and other factors that influence climate processes throughout the year.Those uncovered relationships, Dong said, now cast doubt on estimations from CMIP5 models that projected wetter winters in the future. Models saddled with a larger double-ITCZ bias, it turns out, tend to exaggerate the U.S. Southwest's wetter winters. They also understate the drier winters in the Mediterranean Basin, which also features pronounced wet winters and dry summers similar to California, under warming climate scenarios.Correcting for the bias reduces winter precipitation projections to a level that's roughly equal to California's current winters, amounting to little change and no future wetter winters. In the Mediterranean Basin, said Dong, the correction means winter drying will be intensified by 32 percent.""An important implication of this work,"" said Dong, ""is that a reduction in estimated winter precipitation will likely mean a reduction in spring runoff and an increase in spring temperature, and both increase the likelihood of wildfire risk in California.""Though the study's focus was restricted solely to winter precipitation, said Leung, its implications reach to all seasons.""The implications aren't just about how wet things will or won't be,"" said Leung. ""When people think about precipitation, they tend to think about how much rain they'll get. But precipitation has a lot of implications, like snowpack in mountainous areas, for example, and that means whatever changes we see in winter precipitation will have subsequent implications for springtime or even summertime. The impacts don't just affect winter; they'll be felt throughout the year.""The findings do not bode well for agricultural production, as over one third of the country's vegetables are grown in California soil, and two thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown on California farms, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Almonds and grapes, two especially water-hungry crops, were among the state's top producing commodities, bringing in a combined $11.5 billion in 2019.Over 4 million acres and nearly 10,500 structures burned in the state's 2020 wildfire season. The fire season has grown longer, according to Cal Fire, which cites warmer spring temperatures as one of the reasons forests are now more susceptible to wildfire.Dong and her research partners hope the findings will better inform resource management groups as they prepare for coming wildfire seasons and plan for drier-than-expected winters.The double-ITCZ bias is prominent in all CMIP5 climate models, said Leung, as well as CMIP6 models, the most recent generation, though the latter were not considered in this work. ""If you look at the whole ensemble of models,"" said Leung, ""you see quite similar biases.""This research was funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research as part of the Regional and Global Modeling and Analysis program area.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have found that climate models are underestimating the extent of future winter drying in California.

315,15-Dec-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201215140833.htm,Oceanographers have an explanation for the Arctic's puzzling ocean turbulence,"Eddies are often seen as the weather of the ocean. Like large-scale circulations in the atmosphere, eddies swirl through the ocean as slow-moving sea cyclones, sweeping up nutrients and heat, and transporting them around the world.","In most oceans, eddies are observed at every depth and are stronger at the surface. But since the 1970s, researchers have observed a peculiar pattern in the Arctic: In the summer, Arctic eddies resemble their counterparts in other oceans, popping up throughout the water column. However, with the return of winter ice, Arctic waters go quiet, and eddies are nowhere to be found in the first 50 meters beneath the ice. Meanwhile, deeper layers continue to stir up eddies, unaffected by the abrupt change in shallower waters.This seasonal turn in Arctic eddy activity has puzzled scientists for decades. Now an MIT team has an explanation. In a paper published today in the By modeling the physics of the ocean, they found that wintertime ice acts as a frictional brake, slowing surface waters and preventing them from speeding into turbulent eddies. This effect only goes so deep; between 50 and 300 meters deep, the researchers found, the ocean's salty, denser layers act to insulate water from frictional effects, allowing eddies to swirl year-round.The results highlight a new connection between eddy activity, Arctic ice, and ocean stratification, that can now be factored into climate models to produce more accurate predictions of Arctic evolution with climate change.""As the Arctic warms up, this dissipation mechanism for eddies, i.e. the presence of ice, will go away, because the ice won't be there in summer and will be more mobile in the winter,"" says John Marshall, professor of oceanography at MIT. ""So what we expect to see moving into the future is an Arctic that is much more vigorously unstable, and that has implications for the large-scale dynamics of the Arctic system.""Marshall's co-authors on the paper include lead author Gianluca Meneghello, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, along with Camille Lique, Pal Erik Isachsen, Edward Doddridge, Jean-Michel Campin, Healther Regan, and Claude Talandier.For their study, the researchers assembled data on Arctic ocean activity that were made available by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The data were collected between 2003 and 2018, from sensors measuring the velocity of the water at different depths throughout the water column.The team averaged the data to produce a time series to produce a typical year of the Arctic Ocean's velocities with depth. From these observations, a clear seasonal trend emerged: During the summer months with very little ice cover, they saw high velocities and more eddy activity at all depths of the ocean. In the winter, as ice grew and increased in thickness, shallow waters ground to a halt, and eddies disappeared, whereas deeper waters continued to show high-velocity activity.""In most of the ocean, these eddies extend all the way to the surface,"" Marshall says. ""But in the Arctic winter, we find that eddies are kind of living beneath the surface, like submarines hanging out at depth, and they don't get all the way up to the surface.""To see what might be causing this curious seasonal change in eddy activity, the researchers carried out a ""baroclinic instability analysis."" This model uses a set of equations describing the physics of the ocean, and determines how instabilities, such as weather systems in the atmosphere and eddies in the ocean, evolve under given conditions.The researchers plugged various conditions into the model, and for each condition they introduced small perturbations similar to ripples from surface winds or a passing boat, at various ocean depths. They then ran the model forward to see whether the perturbations would evolve into larger, faster eddies.The researchers found that when they plugged in both the frictional effect of sea ice and the effect of stratification, as in the varying density layers of the Arctic waters, the model produced water velocities that matched what the researchers initially saw in actual observations. That is, they saw that without friction from ice, eddies formed freely at all ocean depths. With increasing friction and ice thickness, waters slowed and eddies disappeared in the ocean's first 50 meters. Below this boundary, where the water's density, i.e. its stratification, changes dramatically, eddies continued to swirl.When they plugged in other initial conditions, such as a stratification that was less representative of the real Arctic ocean, the model's results were a weaker match with observations.""We're the first to put forward a simple explanation for what we're seeing, which is that subsurface eddies remain vigorous all year round, and surface eddies, as soon as ice is around, get rubbed out because of frictional effects,"" Marshall explains.Now that they have confirmed that ice friction and stratification have an effect on Arctic eddies, the researchers speculate that this relationship will have a large impact on shaping the Arctic in the next few decades. There have been other studies showing that summertime Arctic ice, already receding faster year by year, will completely disappear by the year 2050. With less ice, waters will be free to swirl up into eddies, at the surface and at depth. Increased eddy activity in the summer could bring in heat from other parts of the world, further warming the Arctic.At the same time, the wintertime Arctic will be ice covered for the foreseeable future, notes Meneghello. Whether a warming Arctic will result in more ocean turbulence throughout the year or in a stronger variability over the seasons will depend on sea ice's strength.Regardless, ""if we move into a world where there is no ice at all in the summer and weaker ice during winter, the eddy activity will increase,"" Meneghello says. ""That has important implications for things moving around in the water, like tracers and nutrients and heat, and feedback on the ice itself.""",Climate,2020.0,"Arctic eddies have been observed to disappear in the winter months, but remain active in deeper layers of the ocean.

Data that will be included in the next IPCC report. This study is published in ","The Greenland ice sheet, the second largest after the Antarctic's, covers an area of 1.7 million square kilometres. Its total melting could lead to a significant rise in ocean levels, up to 7 metres. Although we are not there yet, the previous scenarios predicted by climate models have just been revised upwards, predicting a rise in sea levels of up to 18 cm by 2100 (compared to the 10 cm announced previously) just because of the increase in surface melting. Within the framework of the next IPCC report (AR6) which will appear in 2022, the University of Liège Laboratory of climatology has been led to apply, within the framework of the ISMIP6 project, the MAR climate model which it is developing to downscale the old and new IPCC scenarios. The results obtained showed that for the same evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations till 2100, these new scenarios predict a 60% greater surface melting of the Greenland ice cap than previously estimated for the previous IPCC report (AR5, 2013).The MAR model was the first to demonstrate that the Greenland ice sheet would melt further with a warming of the Arctic in summer.

As the new IPCC scenarios are based on models whose physics have been improved -- in particular by incorporating a better representation of cloudiness -- and whose spatial resolution has been increased, these new projections should in theory be more robust and reliable.The team of the Laboratory of Climatology was the first to downscale these scenarios on the Greenland ice cap.

The team used various data, including ship-based data from 2018, to uncover how a single atmospheric event over the northern Pacific Ocean caused significantly delayed sea ice formation in the Pacific Arctic region.","""Global warming is going on, so the global mean surface air temperature is increasing, but compared to that trend, the Arctic is warming twice or more as fast,"" said Assistant Professor Tsubasa Kodaira, first author of the recent research publication and an expert in applied physical oceanography from the University of Tokyo.One important heat source in the Arctic is warm Pacific seawater. The seawater flows northward into the Bering Sea, then through the narrow, 85-kilometer wide opening of the Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea and onward into the Arctic. Researchers aboard the research vessel Mirai in November 2018 recorded water conditions for 12 consecutive days while sailing along the edge of sea ice in the Chukchi Sea. Despite ideal atmospheric conditions for sea ice formation, researchers recorded that the water surface remained unusually warm and ice-free.The delay of sea ice formation in 2018 was remarkable even in an era of climate change turning extreme weather into regular events. Sea ice coverage of the Chukchi Sea remained 20% less from Nov. 13 through Dec. 4, 2018, compared to the average from 2002 to 2017.The research team analyzed satellite recordings of sea surface temperature of the Chukchi Sea from 2002 to 2018. During the months when sea ice formed, the fluctuations of seawater temperature closely matched fluctuations of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, large-scale and long-term sea surface temperature variations over northern regions of the Pacific. Despite this two-decade association between Chukchi Sea temperature and the PDO index, when the Chukchi Sea was at its warmest in November 2018, the PDO was neutral.The research team looked specifically at monthly sea surface temperatures from August through November in every year. Typically, seawater temperature cooled by about two degrees each month as summer fades to winter. In 2018, the temperature remained the same as August in September.""So, something was happening in summer to create the unusual warm seawater observed by Mirai in November 2018,"" said Kodaira.Researchers then examined additional atmospheric satellite data recordings and noticed sustained, unusually high air pressure over the Bering Sea in September 2018. This high pressure is known as atmospheric blocking and leads to stationary weather patterns. This atmospheric blocking caused a sustained increase in wind blowing northward over the Bering Strait.Kodaira's team estimates that these winds led to 70% more water than average flowing from the Pacific into the Arctic.""This large volume of additional warm Pacific water was likely what prohibited sea ice advance towards the south in November 2018,"" said Kodaira.Researchers regard the September 2018 Bering Sea atmospheric blocking event as unusual because although such events are common in the region during the winter, they are significantly less common in the summer and autumn.The unusual atmospheric blocking in September and remarkably delayed sea ice formation in November occurred during a year with a neutral PDO index. The study of Kodaira's team also showed that seawater temperatures increase by a full 1 degree Celsius during a positive phase of PDO index.If atmospheric blocking were to occur simultaneously with a positive PDO index, researchers predict sea surface temperatures in the Arctic could rise by approximately 2 degrees Celsius, dramatically reducing -- not just delaying -- annual sea ice growth.The Pacific Arctic region, including the Chukchi Sea, was previously known to have experienced a significant reduction of summer sea ice and this new study has demonstrated one mechanism of how sea ice formation can be delayed. The researchers hope that their new findings will lead to better predictions of Arctic sea ice formation, benefiting global weather forecasting and predictions of local Arctic ecosystem health.",Climate,2020.0,"The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the global mean surface air temperature due to warm Pacific seawater flowing northward into the Bering Sea and into the Arctic, according to research by the University of Tokyo.

To test this, a University of Maine-led research team studied the current ranges of hundreds of North American trees and shrubs, assessing the degree to which species are growing in all of the places that are climatically suitable. Researchers found evidence of widespread ""underfilling"" of these potential climatic habitats -- only 50% on average -- which could mean that trees already have disadvantage as the world continues to warm.Benjamin Seliger, a then UMaine Ph.D. student with the Climate Change Institute, spearheaded the study with his doctoral adviser, Jacquelyn Gill, a UMaine associate professor of paleoecology and plant ecology. Brain McGill, a UMaine professor of biological sciences, and Jens-Christian Svenning, a macroecologist and biogeographer from Aarhus University in Denmark also contributed.The team used species distribution models to assess the degree to which 447 North American trees' and shrubs' ""fill"" their potential climatic ranges by comparing regions that are climatically suitable, known as potential ranges, against where trees are actually found, or their realized ranges.The Seliger, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Center of Geospatial Analytics at North Carolina State University, and co-authors discovered a significant difference between where the trees they studied could grow, and where they actually grow, also known as range filling. The average range filling value across all 447 species equalled 48.6%, indicating that on average, trees are not found in about half of the areas that are climatically suitable for them, according to researchers.""We found tree ranges are more limited by non-climatic factors than expected, suggesting trees may not simply track warming climates."" Seliger says.Species distribution models (SDMs) are a common tool to predict how climate change will affect biodiversity and the future ranges of plants and animals. Various studies, including the one from the UMaine-led group, however, caution that because this tool assumes that species live in all areas that are climatically suitable, known as experiencing climatic equilibrium, it may not provide an accurate prediction of where species will be found in the future.An SDM relies on what has been considered a foundational principle, ""that geographic ranges generally appear to be in equilibrium with contemporary climate,"" according to researchers. Growing evidence suggests otherwise for many species, which experience climatic disequilibrium.Seliger and his team found that North American trees and shrubs with large ranges tended to show much stronger evidence of climatic equilibrium, meaning they had high range filling. Small-ranged species, however, had much lower range filling overall, performing worse than predicted by a null model. According to researchers, that means small-ranged tree species, including many rare trees and species the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists as vulnerable, will face additional challenges as they try to track their climates into the future.The group also found that small-rage species may be more limited by nonclimatic influences, such as soils or pathogens. Conservation efforts for these plants and animals, therefore, should ""account for a complex interplay of factors in addition to climate when preparing for the next century of global change,"" according to researchers.Their findings support a growing body of evidence that for a climatic disequilibrium among various flora. As to what causes the disequilibrium could be due to two factors, according to researchers: dispersal lags that date back to the time when glaciers covered large portions of North American 21,000 years ago, or by non-climatic factors that may influence ranges more than previously appreciated, such as soil, competition with other plants, or symbiosis.""It's been thought that if you zoom out to the scale of North America, climate was the most important factor in determining where species would be found. This study reveals some striking gaps in our knowledge; even at the scale of an entire continent, soils or other plants and animals may be playing an important role too. We used to think those were more important at the more local scale -- think of how the trees might change across two areas of your favorite park,"" Gill says. ""All of this means that when it comes to plants, our predictive tools need to get a lot more sophisticated, if they're going to be useful for conservation.""",Climate,2020.0,"A University of Maine-led research team has found that trees and shrubs across North America are growing in just 50% of the areas that are climatically suitable for them, indicating that they already have a disadvantage as the world continues to warm.

""That's important because there are millions of orphaned and abandoned wells around the world, and cracks in the casings can allow methane to escape into the environment.""When natural gas wells are drilled, cement is used to secure the pipe, or casing, to the surrounding rock, creating a seal that prevents methane from migrating into the shallow subsurface, where it could enter waterways, or the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas, the scientists said.Wells can extend miles underground and over time changing temperatures and pressures can degrade the cement, causing cracks to form. The scientists said repairs involve injecting cement in very narrow areas between the casing and rock, requiring special cement.""In construction, you may just mix cement and pour it, but to seal these wells you are cementing an area that has the thickness of less than a millimeter, or that of a piece of tape,"" Dahi Taleghani said.

Thus small changes in the functioning of tropical forests can significantly change the atmospheric levels of COProfessor Manuel Gloor and Dr Roel Brienen, of Leeds' School of Geography, are co-authors of the new study.Professor Gloor said: ""Many regions in the tropics are heating up particularly rapidly and substantial areas will become warmer, on average, than approximately 25 C.""Our findings -- which are the first to demonstrate that there is a temperature threshold -- suggests that for trees in these regions, their longevity is likely to be negatively affected.""Dr Brienen added: ""This indicates that tropical forests may be more vulnerable to increasing heat than has been previously thought. As a result of global warming, we therefore expect a shortening of tree lifespans in the tropics.""These results are a warning sign that, along with deforestation, global warming adds extra stress on the Earth's tropical forests.""The research team, led by Dr Giuliano Locosselli, from the Institute of Biosciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil, spent four years examining tree-ring data from more than 100,000 trees worldwide belonging to 400 different tree species from 3,000 sites across the globe.Dr Locosselli said: ""In the tropics, trees grow, on average, twice as fast as those in cooler regions of the world. But they also have a shorter average lifespan of 186 years, compared to 322 years of trees in other climates. Our analysis suggests that the life-spans in the tropics will likely decrease further still.""If tropical trees die earlier, this will affect how much carbon these forests can hold, raising concerns about the future potential of forests to offset COCurrently, average temperatures in tropical rainforests vary between 21 C and 30 C. According to the latest forecasts, tropical temperatures on land will continue to rise, reaching on average a combined 2.5 C above pre-industrial levels over the next 10 to 20 years. The study also shows that temperature effects on tree longevity will be further exacerbated by dry conditions.Climate change will also have an impact on tropical rainforests outside of South America, such as the Congo Forest in west Africa -- the second largest tropical forest in the world after the Amazon.Dr Locosselli added: ""While tropical rainforests in the Amazon are already close to this temperature threshold temperatures in the Congo are lower. But, with this great increase in temperature, we might begin to see signs of increased tree mortality. From this point of view, the scenario is quite bleak.""Professor Marcos Buckeridge, Director of the Biosciences Institute of the University of São Paulo, who is also a co-author of the study, added: ""Temperatures will keep rising in the near future even if we were to take drastic emissions reductions measures.""Thus it is unavoidable that the critical threshold for tree longevity will increasingly be exceeded in the tropics and thus it is even more important to protect tropical forests and curb greenhouse emissions.""",Climate,2020.0,"Rising temperatures in tropical areas, including the Amazon, Pantanal and Atlantic forests, are likely to accelerate tree mortality, according to a study by researchers from the University of Leeds and the University of São Paulo.

These biologically rich ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, from warming ocean temperatures brought on by climate change to increases in water pollution from coastal development. According to current estimates, 75 percent of the world's coral reefs could face critical threat levels by 2050. Scientists widely agree that immediate and well-targeted action must be taken to preserve coral reefs for future generations. However, without a clear understanding of where live corals are found, management and conservation efforts will remain hampered at best and ineffective at worst.","Previous work to assess live coral cover has been constrained by technical limitations inherent to available surveillance approaches. For instance, detailed field-based surveys are geographically limited, while satellites cannot track corals at resolutions detailed enough for many types of management activities. Airborne technologies, however, can collect enormous tracts of contiguous high-resolution data within a single survey, providing insights into both coral health and extent. If the resulting maps can indicate the location of live corals, then specific strategies can be created to preserve, protect, and restore them.A critical case in point is the Hawaiian Islands, an icon of the natural world and the modern-day stresses underway on reef ecosystems. Coastal development has resulted in hotspots of sedimentation, waterborne pollutants, and reef removal, while fishing and other resource uses have generated declines in reef resilience. Marine heatwaves, driven by a warming global climate, have also periodically engulfed the Hawaiian Islands, with the 2015 and 2019 coral bleaching events being the most recent. The 2015 event caused widespread coral death, but the geographic extent of coral loss or resistance has remained poorly understood, as it has in reef regions throughout the world.Using a new airborne mapping approach developed by researchers at Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science (GDCS), the geographic distribution of live corals was, for the first time, quantified to 16 meters (51 feet) of water depth across the main Hawaiian islands. The study was published today in ""We undertook this first-ever mapping of a large archipelago to determine where corals live in Hawaiian waters despite repeated heatwaves and problematic coastal development issues,"" said Greg Asner, lead author of the study and director of GDCS. ""It's this basic information that is needed by partner organizations to drive more cost-effective protections, restoration activities, and public engagement.""The mapping data were collected by the ASU Global Airborne Observatory, an aircraft-based laboratory developed by Asner and his team that houses advanced Earth mapping technology. By combining laser-guided imaging spectroscopy and artificial intelligence, the new approach reveals unprecedented views of coral reefs below the ocean surface. The maps show where live corals persist as well as areas of degraded reef.""Operational mapping of live coral cover within and across Hawaii's reef ecosystems affords opportunities for managers and policy-makers to better address reef protection, resilience, and restoration,"" said Brian Neilson, head of Hawaii's Division of Aquatic Resources and study co-author. ""With these new maps, we have a better shot at protecting what we have while focusing on where to improve conditions for corals and the myriad of species that depend upon corals.""The team's mapping of live corals was integrated with geospatial information on coastal and marine activities, and computer algorithms were used to estimate which factors most closely predict where corals are currently found on Hawaiian reefs. The results of the analysis revealed that nearshore development has a major negative relationship with live corals.""Never before has there been such a detailed and synoptic view of live corals at this scale,"" said co-author Jamison Gove of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""These findings are foundational for developing place-based conservation and management strategies to promote reef persistence and mitigate further losses in corals across Hawaii.""The new mapping approach also pointed out areas where corals show resilience to human-driven environmental stressors. These regions of coral survival, deemed 'refugia', suggest that some corals and some sites are more resilient, and are thus prime locations for enhanced coral conservation. Garnering a greater understanding of coral survivorship could also alter predictions of whether corals will survive in the current and future ocean climate.""We are trying to make major leaps on the science and technology side to directly address coral reef conservation and management challenges, starting in the Hawaiian Islands,"" said Asner. ""Our hope is that these outcomes will grow the discussion among communities, environmental managers, and elected officials, without which, we will continue to lose coral reefs right before our eyes.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science (GDCS) have developed a new airborne mapping approach to quantify the geographic distribution of live corals across the main Hawaiian islands.

The research suggests this may shorten the odds of finding life on so-called 'twin-Earths' in the Universe.","The research, published in the Nature journal Geological data demonstrate that Earth's climate has remained continuously habitable for more than three billion years. However, it has been precariously balanced, with the potential to rapidly deteriorate to deep-frozen or intolerably hot conditions causing planet-wide sterility.Professor Toby Tyrrell, a specialist in Earth System Science at the University of Southampton, explains: ""A continuously stable and habitable climate on Earth is quite puzzling. Our neighbours, Mars and Venus, do not have habitable temperatures, even though Mars once did. Earth not only has a habitable temperature today, but has kept this at all times across three to four billion years -- an extraordinary span of geological time.""Many events can threaten the continuous stability of a planet -- asteroid impacts, solar flares and major geological events, such as eruptions of supervolcanoes. Indeed, an asteroid which hit the Earth 66 million years ago caused the extinction of more than 75 per cent of all species, killing off the dinosaurs along with many other species.Previous computer modelling work on Earth habitability has involved modelling a single planet: Earth. But, inspired by discoveries of exoplanets (those outside of our solar system) that reveal that there are billions of Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone, a Southampton scientist took a novel approach to investigating a big question: what has led Earth to remain life-sustaining for so long?To explore this, Professor Tyrrell tapped into the power of the University of Southampton's Iridis supercomputing facility to run simulations looking at how 100,000 randomly different planets responded to random climate-altering events spread out across three billion years, until they reached a point where they lost their habitability. Each planet was simulated 100 times, with different random events each time.Having accrued a vast set of results, he then looked to see whether habitability persistence was restricted to just a few planets which were always capable of sustaining life for three billion years, or instead was spread around many different planets, each of which only sometimes stayed habitable for this period.The results of the simulation were very clear. Most of those planets which remained life-sustaining throughout the three billion year period only had a probability, not a certainty, of staying habitable. Many instances were of planets which usually failed in the simulations and only occasionally remained habitable. Out of a total population of 100,000 planets, nine percent (8,700) were successful at least once -- of those, nearly all (about 8,000) were successful fewer than 50 times out of 100 and most (about 4,500) were successful fewer than 10 times out of 100.The study results suggest chance is a major factor in determining whether planets, such as Earth, can continue to nurture life over billions of years. Professor Tyrrell concludes: ""We can now understand that Earth stayed suitable for life for so long due, at least in part, to luck. For instance, if a slightly larger asteroid had hit Earth, or had done so at a different time, then Earth may have lost its habitability altogether.""To put it another way, if an intelligent observer had been present on the early Earth as life first evolved, and was able to calculate the chances of the planet staying habitable for the next several billion years, the calculation may well have revealed very poor odds.""Given these seemingly poor odds, the study speculates that elsewhere in the Universe there should be Earth-like planets which had similar initial prospects but which, due to chance events, at one point became too hot or too cold and consequently lost the life upon them. As techniques to investigate exoplanets improve, and what seem at first to be 'twin Earths' are discovered and analysed, it seems likely that most will be found to be uninhabitable.",Climate,2020.0,"Earth's climate has remained habitable for over three billion years, but it has been precariously balanced and could rapidly deteriorate to deep-frozen or intolerably hot conditions.

Projected changes in temperature and relative humidity are expected to lead to longer fire seasons and more severe fire weather in Oregon's Western Cascade mountains, which in turn will result in larger, more frequent fires.""Because of shifts in climate, the scenarios that would create extreme fire events all become a little more plausible,"" said Andy McEvoy, the study's lead author and a graduate student in environmental science and management. ""There will be that many more days under which those components of a fire -- ignition, weather and fuel -- can align in a terrible way.""The group of researchers simulated four climate scenarios from 2040-2069, representing a range of plausible changes in temperature and humidity.The simulations showed that the fire season increased from as little as eight days to as much as 32 days. The projected annual average area burned increased significantly by 50% under the least impactful scenario (the coolest and wettest of the four) and as much as 540% under the most extreme scenario (the hottest and driest of the four).""We don't make the case that one future is more likely than the other, but it helps bracket the plausible outcomes for planning purposes,"" said McEvoy, who works as a research fellow in the U.S. Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research Station. ""The future is very uncertain and if land and resource managers plan just for the average case, their plans are not going to be robust in the face of those worst-case scenarios.""The researchers, who worked closely with the Clackamas River Water Providers and the Clackamas County Water and Environment Services, said the findings provide regional managers and planners with a tool to develop climate adaptation and risk mitigation strategies. Given the wide range of plausible future wildfire hazards, robust adaptation plans will be ones that maintain essential ecosystem services across the broadest range of scenarios by balancing land use management, fire suppression, and community preparedness strategies.These efforts could range from designing and testing the effectiveness of fuel breaks -- breaks in vegetation that can help firefighters control the spread of fire and protect homes and resources -- to identifying susceptible communities and planning evacuations in the event of future extreme wildfires. In those cases, like the Riverside Fire, fuel breaks would not be successful and the only sensible strategy would be timely, safe evacuations.""They're planning for an uncertain future,"" McEvoy said.

These leaks have been ongoing for thousands of years but could be intensified by a future warmer ocean. The potential for this gas to escape the ocean, and contribute to the greenhouse gas budget in the atmosphere, is an important mystery that scientists are trying to solve.","The total amount of methane in the atmosphere has increased immensely over the past decades, and while some of the increase can be ascribed to human activity, other sources are not very well constrained.A recent paper in The moon controls one of the most formidable forces in nature -- the tides that shape our coastlines. Tides, in turn, significantly affect the intensity of methane emissions from the Arctic Ocean seafloor.""We noticed that gas accumulations, which are in the sediments within a meter from the seafloor, are vulnerable to even slight pressure changes in the water column. Low tide means less of such hydrostatic pressure and higher intensity of methane release. High tide equals high pressure and lower intensity of the release"" says co-author of the paper Andreia Plaza Faverola.""It is the first time that this observation has been made in the Arctic Ocean. It means that slight pressure changes can release significant amounts of methane. This is a game-changer and the highest impact of the study."" Says another co-author, Jochen Knies.Plaza Faverola points out that the observations were made by placing a tool called a piezometer in the sediments and leaving it there for four days.It measured the pressure and temperature of the water inside the pores of the sediment. Hourly changes in the measured pressure and temperature revealed the presence of gas close to the seafloor that ascends and descends as the tides change. The measurements were made in an area of the Arctic Ocean where no methane release has previously been observed but where massive gas hydrate concentrations have been sampled.""This tells us that gas release from the seafloor is more widespread than we can see using traditional sonar surveys. We saw no bubbles or columns of gas in the water. Gas burps that have a periodicity of several hours won't be identified unless there is a permanent monitoring tool in place, such as the piezometer."" Says Plaza FaverolaThese observations imply that the quantification of present-day gas emissions in the Arctic may be underestimated. High tides, however, seem to influence gas emissions by reducing their height and volume.""What we found was unexpected and the implications are big. This is a deep-water site. Small changes in pressure can increase the gas emissions but the methane will still stay in the ocean due to the water depth. But what happens in shallower sites? This approach needs to be done in shallow Arctic waters as well, over a longer period. In shallow water, the possibility that methane will reach the atmosphere is greater."" Says Knies.High sea-level seems thus to influence gas emissions by potentially reducing their height and volume. The question remains whether sea-level rise due to global warming might partially counterbalance the effect of temperature on submarine methane emissions.""Earth systems are interconnected in ways that we are still deciphering, and our study reveals one of such interconnections in the Arctic: The moon causes tidal forces, the tides generate pressure changes, and bottom currents that in turn shape the seafloor and impact submarine methane emissions.

""A lot of state and local regulations don't recognize 'alternative daily cover' as a beneficial use. But our work shows that using compost as alternative daily cover at landfills is competitive, and often superior, to the use of compost as a soil amendment in terms of its environmental benefits.""Landfills apply a layer of daily cover each day in order to reduce odors, reduce wind-blown debris and keep vermin out of the landfilled waste. Federal regulations currently require six inches of soil as a daily cover.Meanwhile, while most of the nation's yard waste is already turned into compost, a small and rapidly growing percentage of its food waste is also being composted. However, compost from food waste often contains broken glass and other contaminants, making it unsuitable for most soil amendments, such as use in gardens or agricultural fields. There are technologies available to remove contaminants, but these increase the cost of composting. In addition, there is not always a sufficient local market for all of the available compost.Levis and his collaborators wanted to determine how environmentally beneficial it would be to use compost as alternative daily cover on landfills, and whether those benefits were comparable to the benefits of using compost to amend soil.To that end, the researchers developed a complex computational model to predict the overall environmental impact of two defined cases: the use of compost to amend soil (e.g., in your garden) and the use of compost as a daily cover in landfills. The model ran simulations evaluating the entire life cycle of each case. For example, they not only looked at greenhouse gases released by compost, but at greenhouse gas emissions from the equipment that applies compost at landfill facilities. The simulations also accounted for decreases in emissions, such as reduced emissions related to fertilizer use when growers use compost in their soil instead of conventional fertilizers.Specifically, the model looked at five environmental impacts:The researchers ran a range of simulations in order to account for both uncertainty and the wide variety of different circumstances under which the two cases might take place.The researchers found that using compost as daily cover outperformed its use as a soil amendment in almost 100% of the simulations evaluated when it comes to eutrophication. Daily cover also did more to reduce acidification in 77% of simulations and reduced global warming potential 63% of the time.

""Effective ocean planning that accounts for climate change will lead to better safeguards for marine fish and commercial fisheries with few tradeoffs.""As the ocean becomes busier with shipping, energy development, fishing, conservation, recreation and other uses, planning efforts that set aside parts of the ocean for such uses have begun on all seven continents. But these efforts typically do not plan ahead for the impacts of climate change despite establishing plans that can last for many decades.With ocean waters warming, many commercially valuable fish species could move hundreds of miles northward toward colder water in the years ahead. Such movement is already underway -- in some cases dramatically -- substantially disrupting fisheries and exacerbating international fisheries conflicts.Researchers led by Pinsky focused on the costs and benefits of planning ahead for the impacts of climate change on marine species. They simulated the ocean planning process in the United States and Canada for conservation zones, fishing zones and wind and wave energy development zones. Then they looked at nearly 12,000 different projections for where 736 species around North America will move during the rest of this century. They also looked at potential tradeoffs between meeting conservation and sustainable fishing goals now versus in 80 years.""We were worried that planning ahead would require setting aside a lot more of the ocean for conservation or for fishing, but we found that was not the case,"" Pinsky said. ""Instead, fishing and conservation areas can be set up like hopscotch boxes so fish and other animals can shift from one box into another as they respond to climate change. We found that simple changes to ocean plans can make them much more robust to future changes. Planning ahead can help us avoid conflicts between, for example, fisheries and wind energy or conservation and fisheries.""While the study focused on long-term changes, many fisheries decisions are focused on near-term changes -- one to a few years ahead, Pinsky said. So the scientists are now testing whether they can forecast near-term shifts in where species are found so fisheries can adapt more easily to species on the move.While climate change will severely disrupt many human activities and ""complete climate-proofing is impossible, proactively planning for long-term ocean change across a wide range of sectors is likely to provide substantial benefits,"" the study says.",Climate,2020.0,"Effective ocean planning that takes climate change into account will lead to better safeguards for marine fish and commercial fisheries with few tradeoffs, according to a study led by Rutgers University.

The Princeton-MPIC team measured the nitrogen isotope ratios of the trace organic matter trapped in the mineral walls of these fossils, which revealed the evolution of nitrogen concentrations in Antarctic surface waters over the past 150,000 years, covering two ice ages and two warm interglacial periods.""Analysis of the nitrogen isotopes trapped in fossils like diatoms reveals the surface nitrogen concentration in the past,"" said Ellen Ai, first author of the study and a Princeton graduate student working with Sigman and with the groups of Alfredo Martínez-García and Gerald Haug at MPIC.

These areas are estimated to contain about twice as much carbon as the world's current atmosphere. New research says that these permafrost soils are not only increasingly thawing out as the Earth becomes warmer, but also releasing that carbon, which accelerates the thawing.","An international research team that includes Thomas Borch, Colorado State University professor in the Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, and Monique Patzner, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tübingen's Center for Applied Geoscience in Germany, has investigated the way this development affects the microorganisms in the soil. Their results have been published in The work was led by Andreas Kappler of the University of Tübingen and Casey Bryce at the University of Bristol in the UK.The team worked on the assumption that thawing increases the availability of organic carbon for microorganisms to process, in turn releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and methane. These gases accelerate the greenhouse effect, leading to further permafrost thawing in a vicious cycle.Rising temperatures lead to collapse of intact permafrost soils, resulting in landslides and the widespread formation of wetlands. In this latest study, the team investigated what happens to the carbon trapped in the soil when the permafrost thaws out.""The organic material naturally present in the samples accumulated as peat over thousands of years. With permafrost thaw, microbes become active and are able to decompose the peat,"" Kappler said. ""We also know that iron minerals preserve organic carbon from biodegradation in various environments -- and thus they could be a carbon sink even after the permafrost has thawed.""The reactive iron is present as a kind of rust and might be expected to trap the organic material in what the scientists call a ""rusty carbon sink.""The team investigated the storage potential of the rusty carbon sink at a permafrost peatland at Stordalen mire, Abisko, Sweden. There, samples of the soil porewater and drill cores of the active layer were taken along a permafrost thaw gradient. The research team examined how much organic material was bound to reactive iron minerals, how stable these iron-carbon associations are with permafrost thaw, and whether the microorganisms present could use the material as a source of food and energy. The team also carried out experiments in the laboratory in Tübingen.Borch's team was responsible for characterization of the iron mineralogy along the permafrost thaw gradient using synchrotron-based radiation at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. They observed a loss of poorly crystalline iron and a decrease in organic matter-chelated iron, but an increase in iron-bearing clays and iron sulfurs along the thaw gradient.""This clearly indicated that important iron phases were dissolving due to permafrost thaw-induced anaerobic conditions,"" Borch said.The team found that microorganisms are apparently able to use the iron as a food source, thereby releasing the bound organic carbon into the water in the soil.""That means the rusty carbon sink cannot prevent the organic carbon from escaping from the thawing permafrost,"" Kappler said. ""Based on data available from elsewhere in the northern hemisphere, we expect that our findings are applicable for permafrost environments worldwide,"" added BrycePatzner explained that the rusty carbon sink is only found in intact permafrost soils and is lost during permafrost thaw. Now the researchers are seeking to find out how this facilitates greenhouse gas emissions and thus global warming.""It appears that the previously iron-bound carbon is highly bioavailable and, therefore, bacteria could immediately metabolize it into greenhouse gas emissions,"" Patzner said. ""This is a process which is currently absent from climate-change prediction models and must be factored in.""The Borch lab is now using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory to elucidate the chemical nature and fate of the organic matter released.

It is well-documented that low oxygen levels have detrimental effects on fish and water quality, but little is known about how these conditions will affect the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane in freshwaters.","Carbon dioxide and methane are the primary forms of carbon that can be found in the Earth's atmosphere. Both of these gases are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect, a process that increases global air temperatures. Methane is 34 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so knowing how low oxygen levels within lakes and reservoirs affect both carbon dioxide and methane could have important implications for global warming.Until now, researchers did not have any empirical data from the whole-ecosystem scale to definitively say how changing oxygen can affect these two greenhouse gases.""We found that low oxygen levels increased methane concentrations by 15 to 800 times at the whole-ecosystem scale,"" said Alexandria Hounshell, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Science. ""Our work shows that low oxygen levels in the bottom waters of lakes and reservoirs will likely increase the global warming potential of these ecosystems by about an order of magnitude.""Virginia Tech researchers just published these findings in a high-impact paper in To determine a correlation between oxygen and methane concentrations, researchers honed in on two reservoirs outside of Roanoke. In collaboration with the Western Virginia Water Authority, the research team operated an oxygenation system in Falling Creek Reservoir, which pumps oxygen into the bottom waters and allows researchers to study oxygen concentrations on a whole-ecosystem scale. By also monitoring Beaverdam Reservoir, an upstream reservoir without an oxygenation system, they were able to compare greenhouse gas concentrations in the bottom waters of both reservoirs. They ran the experiment over three years to see how consistent their findings were over time.""Methane levels were much higher when there was no oxygen in the bottom waters of these reservoirs; whereas the carbon dioxide levels were the same, regardless of oxygen levels,"" said Cayelan Carey, associate professor of biological sciences and affiliated faculty member of the Global Change Center. ""With low oxygen levels, our work shows that you'll get higher production of methane, which leads to more global warming in the future.""This study was one of the first to experimentally test at the whole ecosystem-scale how different oxygen levels affect greenhouse gases. Logistically, it is extremely challenging to manipulate entire ecosystems due to their complexity and many moving parts. Even though scientists can use computer modelling and lab experiments, nothing is as definitive as the real thing.""We were able to do a substitution of space for time because we have these two reservoirs that we can manipulate and contrast with one another to see what the future may look like, as lower bottom water oxygen levels become more common. We can say with high certainty that we are going to see these lakes become bigger methane emitters as oxygen levels decrease,"" said Carey.According to Hounshell, the strength of their results lie in the study's expanse over multiple years. Despite having a range of meteorological conditions over the three years, the study affirmed that much higher methane concentrations in low oxygen conditions happen consistently every year, no matter the air temperature.Ultimately, this study is crucial for how researchers, and the general public, think about how freshwater ecosystems produce greenhouse gases in the future. With low oxygen concentrations increasing in lakes and reservoirs across the world, these ecosystems will produce higher concentrations of methane in the future, leading to more global warming.Of course, these ecological changes are not just happening in the Roanoke region. Around the globe, a number of studies have pointed to changing carbon cycling in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, this study is one of the few to address this phenomenon in lakes and reservoirs, which are often neglected in carbon budgets. This study will fill in these knowledge gaps and shine a spotlight on what we can do as citizens to solve this problem.This study suggests that keeping lakes from experiencing low oxygen concentrations in the first place could further prevent them from hitting the tipping point, when they start to become large methane producers. Small decisions can add up. For example, decreasing runoff into lakes and reservoirs can prevent the depletion of oxygen in their bottom waters. ""Don't put a ton of fertilizer on your lawn, and be really strategic about how much fertilizer you use and how you use it,"" said Hounshell.And greenhouse gases are just a small part of the bigger picture of how reservoirs function in the global carbon cycle. Currently, the research team is conducting follow-up oxygen manipulation studies to elucidate other components that contribute to ecosystem change. They will continue to monitor oxygen manipulations in the two Roanoke reservoirs to see how the reservoir can affect the ecosystem for the long haul.This project was funded by the Virginia Tech Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science, the Fralin Life Sciences Institute at Virginia Tech, and by National Science Foundation grant DEB-1753639.",Climate,2020.0,"Low oxygen levels in lakes and reservoirs could increase the global warming potential of ecosystems by up to an order of magnitude, according to a study by Virginia Tech researchers.

These stressful times for reef animals occurred at night when scientists do not typically make observations.To test the responses of sea urchins to these alarming conditions, they designed experiments to separate the effects of acidity (pH), oxygen and temperature. Conditions in the ocean change quickly, so the experiments were designed to reflect this, and they only exposed the animals to different sets of conditions for two hours at a time.The area of the study encompassed an entire bay and nearby, offshore waters. In that area, Hospital Point reef is one of the best places to collect the rock boring sea urchin, ""The urchins are so common there you don't even think about putting your foot down,"" said STRI Fellow Eileen Haskett, a co-author. ""When the surf isn't too rough, you can see them hiding in every crevice and reef crack, happily pounded by the waves. When the sunlight hits them perfectly, they shimmer with bright purple and red colors.""Lucey and Haskett collected hundreds of urchins. In the laboratory at STRI's Bocas del Toro Research Station, they exposed these prickly creatures for two hours to the severe hot, hypoxic and acidic conditions sea urchins may experience on local reefs.After their exposure to high temperatures, acidity, low oxygen or combinations of the three, the researchers flipped the urchins upside down. When a sea urchin is flipped, it usually immediately rights itself, using its spines and tube feet. In nature, if they do not right themselves quickly, they may get tossed against the rocks by the surf or eaten by reef fish.The experiment clearly showed that it was much harder for sea urchins to right themselves after being in oxygen-poor water. More acid conditions did not seem to affect the urchins' behavior. However, sea urchins were also less able to find their footing and flip right-side up after exposures to high temperatures. Most survived and were returned to the reef but the low oxygen and high temperature exposures resulted in some mortality.The researchers conclude that ocean acidification may not be nearly as important as lack of oxygen (hypoxia), a factor that has not received as much attention in discussions of global climate change. In fact, even though high temperatures, acidity and low oxygen occur at the same time, the team found that together they did not affect the urchin's performance any more than lack of oxygen alone.""What really caught my attention was the relationship between extreme low oxygen and high temperatures even out at the offshore sites,"" Lucey said. ""It shouldn't be surprising because the relationship between increasing temperatures and decreasing oxygen is well known, but it is somehow eerie to find this in your own data, in your own little part of the world.""""More and more often, tropical reefs experience severe conditions that, as we have shown, push the limits of marine organisms,"" said Rachel Collin, STRI staff scientist and co-author. ""A lack of oxygen and high temperatures are bad news for these reef animals. These severe conditions are occurring more frequently and for longer periods of time, upping the stress levels experienced by important reef organisms like sea urchins.""""Showing how animals react to several forms of stress at the same time helps us understand how marine life is affected by changing conditions, and what conditions to look out for,"" Lucey said. ""We were surprised to find that such hot, hypoxic and acidic conditions all occur even on a reef that gets plenty of wave action. Our realistic experiments are alarming -- showing the levels of oxygen already occasionally found on this reef have such a negative impact on these sea urchins.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) have found that a lack of oxygen in the ocean could be more detrimental to marine life than previously thought.

So goes the first line of Leo Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina."" Little did the Russian novelist know his famous opening line would one day be used to describe microbial communities, their health and their relationships to their hosts.","It's this idea that an unhealthy or stressed host to a microbiome has a more diverse microbiome than its healthy counterpart,"" said UC Santa Barbara ecologist An Bui, a graduate student researcher in the lab of theoretical ecologist Holly Moeller. The diversity, she said, is a response to variable conditions that may in turn indicate an unstable or stressed environment. ""Healthy hosts are probably going to have very similar microbiomes,"" she said, ""while unhealthy hosts are different in their own ways.""Bui and colleagues recently put the Anna Karenina hypothesis to the test in California's Tehachapi mountains as they sought to understand how climate change might affect fungal communities in woodland soil in a future California.""Fungi are really important for woodland systems,"" said Bui, the lead author of a study that appears in the journal As the global average temperature rises, forests and woodlands around the world are under increasing threat, she explained.""It's not just about temperature and rainfall, but also the organisms the trees and plants associate with,"" she said. Soil fungi have a variety of relationships with woodland plants. Saprotrophic fungi, for instance, decompose dead organic matter, while pathotrophs eat live organic matter.And then there are the symbiotrophs, which engage in mutually beneficial relationships with their plant hosts via their roots. Attaching to roots and extending threadlike hyphae in every direction underground -- the so-called ""Wood Wide Web"" -- mycorrhizae give the woodland tree and plant community access to nutrients from faraway places.""They get all of their energy in an exchange for carbon from trees and other plants,"" Bui said. ""And then they give their hosts nitrogen and phosphorus from the soil."" These fungi provide almost half of a tree's organic nitrogen budget, according to the study, and contribute the bulk of new carbon into the soil.To get a sense of how warming could affect California's woodland soil fungal community, the team sampled soils at sites along an arid (dry) to mesic (moderately moist) climactic gradient at the Tejon Ranch in the Tehachapi mountains.""The sites we worked at were a proxy for what we think California would look like with future climate change,"" Bui said. As one ascends from the warmer, drier base of the mountains into the cooler, moister elevations, the landscape changes with the temperature and relative humidity, giving the researchers a glimpse of what California woodlands might look like as climate change forces them to retract.Of particular interest to the team were the soils around the oak trees that dot the landscape, where, in addition to the decomposers and pathogenic fungi in the soil, tree-mutualist mycorrhizae create their vast networks. The researchers were interested in how the number of species and their abundance might change between sites.""As it turns out, the fungal communities are completely different,"" Bui said. ""And the hottest, driest sites have the highest number and the greatest diversity in fungal species."" True to the Anna Karenina hypothesis, the trees under the more arid, stressful conditions had the most diverse and dispersed fungal communities.But, while the larger fungal communities varied from site to site, Bui said, the communities of mutualists within them tended to remain the same, save for small shifts within the mutualist populations to select for traits that could be more useful under the the circumstances.""When we looked at ectomycorrhizae and arbuscular mycorrhizae, those communities were more similar across climactic conditions than the whole fungal community,"" she said. ""So there's a possibility that host association for mutualists at least buffers that shift in community structure the whole fungal community experiences.""If so, the benefit could be reciprocal, according to the researchers. Buffering the fungi from climate change preserves their function, which could, in turn, conserve their host trees' function in the face of a changing California woodland ecosystem.More work would need to be done to understand how far this buffering effect would extend, but the results are a positive bit of news for the future of California woodlands. Further studies could broaden the scope to include how these relationships and other adaptations might affect tree health, according to Bui.""I think this gives us a little bit of hope that the players in this ecosystem that are crucial for the survival of the habitat for many species -- like the oaks -- might be able to keep doing what they're doing,"" she said. ""Even though we do need to do a lot of work in terms of conservation and mitigation, there's a possibility for them to persist. And I think that's hopeful and exciting.""Research in this paper was conducted also by Devyn Orr, Michelle Lepori-Bui, Kelli Konicek, Hillary S. Young and Holly V.

Aarons analyzed samples of Earth's oldest-known rocks from the Acasta Gneiss Complex in the Canadian tundra -- an outcrop of gneisses 4.02 billion years old. These rocks are dated from the Hadean eon, which started at the beginning of Earth's formation and was defined by hellish conditions on a planet that would look alien to our modern eyes.Aarons' research focused on isotopes, which are variations of the same element based on the number of neutrons they have. Taking the samples from Acasta Gneiss provided by Jesse Reimink, an assistant professor at Penn State University, she crushed bits of the rock into a powder that was then heated to form a glass bead, a process that allows dissolution of the titanium she sought to analyze. Once cooled, the bead was dissolved in acid and the titanium was chemically separated from other elements. Aarons was then able to determine the variations of titanium isotopes present in the sample using a mass spectrometer in the Origins lab led by her collaborator Nicolas Dauphas at the University of Chicago.Aarons compared these samples to newer, modern rocks formed in subduction zones. In samples aged at 3.75 billion years old, she noticed similarities in structure and composition to the modern ones, suggesting that plate subduction began around that time.""A lot of previous work has been done on these rocks to carefully date them, and provide the geochemical and petrological context,"" said Aarons. ""We were very lucky to get the opportunity to measure titanium isotope compositions, a burgeoning isotope system in these samples.""Studying the history and onset of ancient subduction zones is notoriously difficult. Rocks are constantly destroyed as the crust is driven inward into the mantle, leaving behind few samples that date back into Earth's earliest history. Scientists have long debated when plate tectonics and subduction began, with estimates ranging from 0.85 to 4.2 billion years ago -- more than two-thirds of the planet's history. Discovering when plate subduction began means pinpointing when Earth transitioned from a planet dominated by transient landmasses piercing through the oceans' surface to one composed of long-lived continents where long-term biogeochemical cycles are controlled by volcanic degassing and recycling into Earth's interior.Plate subduction occurs when oceanic crust and continental crust collide. Because continental crust is thicker and less dense, oceanic crust is pushed downward into the Earth's mantle, at an average rate of a few centimeters each year. This contact with the mantle creates areas that are hot enough for magma to escape to the surface, creating volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens and others found along the Pacific Rim.Plate tectonics and subduction zones are responsible for the way Earth looks, driving the creation of continental plates and the basins that would fill to become oceans. They are also the primary control on the chemical characteristics of the planet's surface, and are likely responsible for Earth's ability to sustain life. These tectonic zones are responsible for the formation of emerged continents and provide an important control on climate by regulating the amounts of the greenhouse carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.In four-billion-year-old rock samples, Aarons saw similarities to modern rocks that are formed in plume settings, like Hawaii and Iceland, where a landmass is drifting over a hot spot. However, in rocks aged at 3.75 billion years, she noticed a shift in trend to rocks that are formed in modern subduction zones, suggesting that around that time in Earth's history these areas began forming.""While the trend in the titanium isotope data does not provide evidence that plate tectonics was happening globally, it does indicate the presence of wet magmatism, which supports subduction at this time,"" said Aarons.The technique used in this study could be applied to other ancient rock formations around the world to gain more information about the composition and evolution of Earth's emerged lands through time.Other institutions involved in the study were Pennsylvania State University (USA) and the University of Bern (Switzerland). The study was funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.",Climate,2020.0,"The clues to Earth's earliest habitability lie in the elements that ancient rocks are composed of, specifically titanium, according to findings published in the journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters.

Greater crop diversity in agriculture is seen as a stabilising factor for food security. Yet crop diversity alone is not sufficient. In an article for ","Crop diversity is a key factor in securing agricultural production. Having a wider variety of crops reduces the risk of total harvest failure when certain crops are affected by plant diseases and protects against poor harvests resulting from extreme weather events, such as droughts, or pest infestation. ""However, asynchrony is at least equally important in securing production,"" says Lukas Egli, UFZ agroecologist and first author of the study. Differences in the temporal sequence in which crops are sown and harvested on arable land or the variation in phenology, i.e. differing development over time during the vegetation period, are both examples of factors that lead to greater asynchrony. ""The more heterogeneously crops are distributed in time and respond to the effects of extreme events, natural disasters and economic crises, the less the agricultural production of a country as a whole will fluctuate,"" says Egli. For example, when different types of crops become ready to harvest at the same time this increases the likelihood of the entire harvest being destroyed in a storm or flood. Asynchrony prevents such total failure, for instance by varying sowing and harvesting times, growing crops with different climate and cultivation requirements and mixed cropping.The analysis of data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed that India, Mexico and China are among the countries with a high level of production stability and asynchrony, whereas Russia, Australia and Argentina have a low level of stability and asynchrony. At present, one observes that asynchrony in agriculture is decreasing at the global level. ""Globalised agricultural markets allow crop failures in one region to be compensated by trade with other regions. Trade itself is therefore a stabilising factor and could make the cultivation of a wide variety of crops with different growth patterns seem less important,"" says Prof Dr Ralf Seppelt, UFZ landscape ecologist and co-author. Nevertheless, countries should give greater consideration to highly diversified and asynchronous crops than they have done in the past to make food production less vulnerable to the uncertainties of the global market.",Climate,2020.0,"Crop diversity is crucial for securing agricultural production, but asynchrony is equally important, according to a study by German research centre UFZ. Asynchrony, which refers to differences in the timing of crop sowing and harvesting, reduces the risk of total harvest failure and protects against poor harvests caused by extreme weather events or pest infestation. The UFZ analysis of FAO data found that India, Mexico and China have high levels of production stability and asynchrony, while Russia, Australia and Argentina have low levels.

A new study analyzing 20 years of data found that the warblers start their egg-laying in southern Illinois significantly earlier in warmer springs. This increases the chances that the birds can raise two broods of offspring during the nesting season, researchers found.","They report their findings in the journal ""Warmer springs in temperate regions of the planet can create a mismatch between when food is available to breeding birds and when their energy demands are highest -- when they are feeding nestlings,"" said Illinois Natural History Survey avian ecologist Jeffrey Hoover, who conducted the study with INHS principal scientist Wendy Schelsky. If climate change diminishes insect populations at critical moments in the birds' nesting season, food shortages may cause some chicks and even adults to die. Other long-distance migratory birds suffer ill consequences from warmer springs on their breeding grounds.But this mismatch seems not to occur in prothonotary warblers, the researchers found.In the Cache River watershed, where the study was conducted, the warblers nest in swamps and forested wetlands, which are abundant sources of insects throughout the spring and summer. The warblers eat caterpillars, flies, midges, spiders, mayflies and dragonflies. As long as it does not dry up, the wetland habitat provides a steady supply of food to sustain the birds.""We studied populations of prothonotary warblers nesting in nest boxes in these areas from 1994-2013,"" Schelsky said. The researchers captured and color-banded the birds, studying 2,017 nesting female warblers in all. They visited the nests every three to five days from mid-April to early August, keeping track of when each bird laid its first egg and the birds' overall reproductive output for each nesting season.They also compared local April temperature trends with those of the Annual Global Land Temperature Anomaly data, a federal record compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They found that local conditions reflected global temperature changes.When local temperatures were warmer in April, the birds tended to lay their first eggs earlier in the spring and, on average, produced a greater number of offspring over the course of the breeding season.""It was exciting to see that the birds could be flexible and adjust their timing of breeding to be earlier in warmer years and benefit by doing so,"" Schelsky said. Starting earlier meant more of the birds could raise additional broods of offspring.As the warming trend continues, conditions may change in ways that harm the birds' reproductive capacity, Hoover said.""Even though these warblers currently produce more offspring in warmer years, continued global warming may eventually upset the balance between arrival dates, food resources and the commencement of nesting,"" he said.

The results, published this week (9 December) in the journal ","The westerly winds (known by latitude as the roaring forties, furious fifties, and screaming sixties) are particularly strong due to the absence of continental landmasses in the Southern Ocean to slow them down. They play an important role in regulating how much carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) is exchanged between the atmosphere and ocean and have been linked to droughts and wildfires, as well as changes in sea ice extent, ocean circulation and ice shelf stability.Researchers have recreated a 700-year record of the winds using radiocarbon dated sediment cores collected from a coastal lake on sub-Antarctic Marion Island. The island, located southeast of South Africa, is uniquely positioned in the core belt of the winds. The team measured changes in the accumulation rate of wind-blown sea salts by studying diatoms -- tiny algae, specifically microalgae -- embedded in the sediment, together with wind-blown dust, to track past wind strength.Results show that during cool periods, such as the Little Ice Age (c. 1400-1870 CE), the winds weakened and shifted towards the equator, and during warm periods (before 1450 and after 1920) they intensified and migrated poleward.Lead author, Dr Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at British Antarctic Survey says:""From this unique high resolution record we can see how much the westerly winds have changed over the last 700 years.

Their investigation, aided by machine learning techniques that sort fires by the conditions that precede them, not only reveals that the risk of wildfire is rising, but also spells out the role moisture plays in estimating fire risk.","In findings shared virtually at the American Geophysical Union's 2020 fall meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 1, atmospheric scientists Ruby Leung and Xiaodong Chen detailed their study of decades-long wildfire records and new simulations of past climate conditions, which they used to identify variables that lead to wildfires. The two will answer questions virtually on Tuesday, Dec. 8.Surprisingly, just enough humidity in the air -- not enough to lead to precipitation -- can boost the likelihood of lightning, which can ignite dry grasslands or water-starved trees. The CZU Lightning Complex fires in Santa Cruz, Calif., for example, were triggered by lightning on Sunday, Aug. 16, 2020, and burned nearly 1,500 structures.While scientists have known the importance of such hydro-meteorological conditions, generating enough data to tease out lengthy soil moisture or humidity trends and thoroughly representing their influence is only recently possible through computational advances in modeling, according to Leung.The researchers employed machine learning to classify wildfires into ""types,"" producing categories like fires that strike when soil is damp or during cloudy days, and the most quickly rising type -- fires that spark on warm, dry, sunny days.These ""compound case"" wildfires, named for their multiple contributing factors, strike more frequently than any other. A warming climate, said Leung, is likely to exacerbate the trend.""Based on the historical trends we see over the past 35 years,"" said Leung, ""it is very likely that trend will continue. That is partly driven by rising temperature and partly driven by reduced soil moisture as snowmelt starts earlier in spring, reducing soil moisture in summer and fall.""This study marks progress toward building a more comprehensive, data-rich take on the hydroclimatic priming of wildfires. Such detailed simulations like the one Leung and Chen incorporated in their study offer a more fine-grained glimpse into how wildfires evolve.""This allows us to draw a very complete picture of how wildfire is triggered across the whole Western United States,"" said Chen.Nearly all types of wildfire, including cloudy day fires, are happening more often. ""Wet case"" fires, which occur when soil moisture levels are higher, are the exception, and their decline coincides with an overall drying trend in the Western United States. California's wet season window is also narrowing, said Leung, adding another challenge to an already fire-ravaged state.The team plans to project wildfire risk into 2070, demonstrating how that risk shifts under different climate scenarios, and to investigate the role snowpack and precipitation seasonality play in wildfire. This work was carried out under the DOE's HyperFACETS project. This and similar work will inform many research and applications communities and lead to better prediction and preparations for future wildfire seasons.One aspect of that new work will focus on a single catastrophic event, the 2017 wildfire season in the Western United States, for example, and tweaking conditions to create analogs of likely future events.

Finding ways to boost coral survival through marine heatwaves is crucial if coral reefs are to endure the coming decades of climate change,"" says UVic marine biologist Julia Baum, the study's senior author.Published today in Worldwide, coral reef fisheries are worth US$6.8 billion annually, and are a vital source of food and income for hundreds of millions of people in tropical island nations. In the lead-up to the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030), there is a renewed and global call to reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health.""Understanding how some corals can survive prolonged heatwaves could provide an opportunity to mitigate the impact of marine heatwaves on coral reefs, allowing us to buy time as we work to limit greenhouse gas emissions,"" says Danielle Claar, who led the study as a UVic doctoral student and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington.Climate change threatens the world's coral reefs because corals are highly sensitive to the temperature of their surrounding waters. During a heatwave, corals release the algae that live in their tissues and produce food for them, causing the coral to turn completely white -- a phenomenon known as coral bleaching. Prolonged bleaching often causes corals to die from starvation. If they can reclaim their food source within a few weeks, they can usually recover.To date, coral recovery from bleaching has only ever been observed after heat stress subsides. With global climate models predicting that heatwaves will continue to increase in both frequency and duration, a coral's ability to recover its food source during a prolonged heatwave is essential to its survival.""Observing corals recovering from bleaching while still baking in hot waters is a game changer,"" says Baum.Baum adds that corals only exhibited this capacity if they were not also exposed to other types of human-caused stressors, such as water pollution. Until now it's been unclear if local reef management could help improve corals chances of surviving climate change. ""We've found a glimmer of hope that protection from local stressors can help corals,"" says Baum.""Although this pathway to survival may not be open to all corals or in all conditions, it demonstrates an innovative strategy for survival that could be leveraged by conservationists to support coral survival,"" adds Claar.The research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the US National Science Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Pew Fellowship, the Rufford Foundation, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Shedd Aquarium.",Climate,2020.0,"A study led by marine biologists from the University of Victoria (UVic) highlights the importance of finding ways to enhance coral survival during marine heatwaves caused by climate change.

According to their analysis published in ","About a million plant and animal species are endangered worldwide. At least 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations, however, depend on biodiversity, including species diversity, the genetic diversity within species and the diversity of ecosystems. Biodiversity regulates fundamental processes, such as soil formation and water-, trace-gas-, and nutrient cycles and thus contributes notably l to regulating the climate. The continued loss of biodiversity makes humankind face ecological, social, and economic problems. ""Apart from the over-exploitation of natural resources on land and in water, or environmental pollution, climate change also causes loss of biological diversity. This impact will increase in future,"" says Almut Arneth, Professor at the Atmospheric Environmental Research Division of the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK-IFU), KIT's Campus Alpine in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. She led an international study that is now published in the In their study, scientists from Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, and Japan analyzed the so-called Aichi targets for the worldwide protection of biodiversity that were adopted by the 10th Conference of the Parties of the UN Convention on Biodiversity in Nagoya, prefecture of Aichi, in 2010 for compliance by 2020. Most of these targets will be missed. In addition, the researchers analyzed the set of revised biodiversity protection targets currently negotiated by the parties for the time after 2020, which are to be reached by 2030 or 2050. They found that many existing or proposed targets are at risk due to global warming, even if the mean global temperature increase would remain at the lower limit of projections. ""It certainly is a big challenge, but also an important opportunity to better handle on the political level the interactions between climate change and biodiversity loss, and to better coordinate the biodiversity targets with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals,"" Arneth explains. The biodiversity targets proposed should therefore consider climate change much more explicitly, she thinks.Arneth gives an example: A biodiversity target for nature reserves must consider the fact that composition and growth of vegetation will change with climate change and that certain species of plants and animals will either migrate or be threatened, if climatic conditions are changing. For instance, climate change causes mountain glaciers to shrink. In semi-arid regions, however, lower lying valley ecosystems depend on melting water from glaciers in summer. If this melt-water flow will decrease due to retreating glaciers, precipitation alone may not be sufficient to supply the plants in the catchment with water. This will then also affect the animals that are dependent on the plants.The study underscores the demand to quickly and significantly reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission and to halt climate change. Vice versa, it also shows that measures to protect biodiversity would contribute to climate protection. ""Better coordination of political agreements and scientific findings may accelerate urgent decarbonization of economy and ensure slowdown of climate change by biodiversity protection measures,"" Arneth summarizes.",Climate,2020.0,"A new international study led by Almut Arneth, Professor at the Atmospheric Environmental Research Division of the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research, warns that most of the 20 biodiversity targets proposed by the United Nations will be missed, with many existing or proposed targets at risk due to global warming.

It is prevalent within the Central Valley's San Joaquin Valley, and also occurs naturally in semi-arid and arid environments worldwide.Researchers focused on locations in the Central Valley aquifers where groundwater uranium concentrations have been observed to exceed the drinking water standard of 30 micrograms of uranium per liter.""Every aquifer has one or more of these natural contaminants.

As rainwater seeps downward, its chemistry changes as it interacts with the ground environment. Pumping the water back out also influences the dynamics of the aquifer, which can change the chemistry of the system and how elements such as uranium are partitioned between the solids (sediments) and water. If the water picks up more calcium during its travels and also becomes more alkaline, it can attract uranium and contaminate aquifers, the researchers found.""Our work shows that it's not just properties of the aquifer that are impacting uranium, but factors such as clay content and pH of the soil that served as important predictors of groundwater uranium concentrations,"" said lead study author Alandra Lopez, a PhD student in Earth system science. ""It highlights the importance of including data about soil properties when generating aquifer vulnerability maps for a naturally occurring contaminant like uranium.""The good news: the researchers estimate that the factors introducing this process of uranium loosening from sediments into groundwater mainly occur within the top six feet of the soil, suggesting an easy fix could involve bypassing that area.""If you're going to manage aquifer recharge, which will be increasingly needed with climate change, be careful about having the water infiltrate through the soil where calcium and alkalinity are often highest.

He compared fish density, biomass, biodiversity and the recruitment of juveniles between warm-water and cold-water species to investigate how the marine protected areas mediated the impact of the heatwave.""We found that the heatwave had an outsized effect on density, recruitment and biodiversity compared to typical oceanographic events like El Niño,"" Freedman said. ""Once we saw that, we focused on data just during the heatwave years to look closely at the trends inside and outside MPAs.""The team asked if fish communities inside the reserves remained similar before, during and after the heatwave in comparison to unprotected locations. Instead, they found little difference in the way that fish communities shifted inside and outside the MPAs.The researchers were surprised by the results, but have formulated a possible explanation. They suspect that trends were similar within and without the MPAs because the heatwave tended to affect non-fished species -- like rock wrasses and Garibaldi -- more than those targeted by fisheries. For non-targeted species, the additional protection of a no-take marine reserve is a moot distinction when it comes to marine heatwaves.""We suspect [non-]targeted species are more responsive because they are usually smaller and have shorter life histories than targeted species,"" Freedman explained. As a result, non-fished species likely feel a stronger impact from acute events like marine heatwaves. Additionally, non-targeted species are generally more abundant, which means there are more individuals for a heatwave to effect.The implications of these findings seem pretty clear to Freedman. ""Because MPAs alone can't mitigate acute ecosystem change during heatwaves, resource managers will need to use a suite of conservation options to maintain important ecosystem services in the Santa Barbara Channel and beyond as heatwaves become more common,"" he said.This study also highlights the close partnership between UC Santa Barbara and the NOAA Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, where Freedman was employed during his Ph.D. and where he is now a research ecologist.""Strong partnerships between academic researchers and resource managers are critical to solving some of the most difficult environmental challenges,"" said Caselle. ""Having the office of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary physically located on our campus is a huge benefit to researchers working on applied problems and managers looking for scientific solutions.""This is the first in a series of papers that aims to identify some of the ways an altered climate will impact the future of kelp forests in Southern and Central California. The team recently submitted another manuscript outlining how they classified warm-water and cold-water species in the hopes that other conservation groups can use their methodology to improve the accuracy their own work. The final paper in the series forecasts future changes in fish species under different climate scenarios for the Santa Barbara Channel, with a goal of allowing for proactive management in the face of climate change.",Climate,2020.0,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are not enough to protect fish from marine heatwaves, according to research from the University of California Santa Barbara and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Researchers found that MPAs were effective at preserving biodiversity and facilitating recovery of single species during and after extreme temperature events.

Finnish researchers have now revised the crucial part of the existing stratigraphic documentation in southern Finland. The new findings show that a considerable part of the warm interval records extends further back in time than earlier thought. The new results change the established conceptions about glacial history in the area.","The new study conducted at the University of Turku has examined geological stratigraphic sequences in southern and central Finland. The material collected during the study was compared with corresponding stratigraphic sequences in Fennoscandia, the Baltic countries and Europe.- One of the studied warm interval records may be circa 300,000-400,000 years old. The forests in South Finland were then composed of scots pine and Norway spruce and contained larch, fir and possibly some species related to present-day Strobus pine, says Professor of Geology Matti E. Räsänen.A major part of the revised warm interval records is, however, attributed to the Röpersdorf-Schöningen interglacial circa 200,000 years ago. The study led by Räsänen has, for the first time, managed to reconstruct the paleogeography, vegetation and climate of this regional interglacial in Fennoscandia. During this interglacial period, the ocean levels were nearly 20m lower than today, and the Gulf of Bothnia hosted fresh water lakes surrounded by boreal pine forests.- This is why Finland had a continental climate with warmer summers and colder winters than today. The forests were dominated by scots pine and the Siberian spruce was growing even in southern Finland. Several species that nowadays grow on the East European Plain and in Southeast Europe were growing in southern Finland, explains Räsänen.During the Eemian interglacial 119,000-131,000 years ago, ocean levels were four to six metres higher than today and the Baltic basin was well connected to oceans.- The dinoflagellate, silicoflagellate and diatom microfossils discovered from the stratigraphic sequences show detailed evidence of the widespread intermixing of continental fresh and marine waters within the shallow Eemian sea coastal waters.Most importantly, the research results change the established conceptions about the nature of the temperate Brörup interval in the beginning of the last Weichselian glacial cycle circa 100,000 years ago. The findings from Björkö Island in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Kvarken Archipelago suggest that during this interval, central and southern Finland supported open birch forest tundra, which was later invaded by spruce, but not boreal pine forests as earlier thought.- The northern limit of pine forests seems to have been located at the Gulf of Riga in the Balticum. The climate in southern Finland was thus considerably cooler than thought.

These new findings about particles formation and sources will contribute to a better understanding of past and future climate.""To understand how the climate has changed over the last century we need to know as reliably as possible the natural atmospheric conditions before the industrialization,"" says Associate Professor Federico Bianchi from the University of Helsinki's Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR).In order to do that scientists are looking for pristine locations around the world where human influence is minimal. An international group of researchers has now completed a comprehensive study at the Nepal Climate Observatory at Pyramid station, located in the proximity of the Everest base camp at 5050 m above sea level. There, they were able to investigate the formation of atmospheric particles far from human activities. The results were published today in the journal The study shows that up-valley winds bring vapours emitted by vegetation at the Himalayan foothills to higher altitudes. During this transport, these gases are transformed by photochemical reactions into compounds of very low volatility, which rapidly form a large number of new aerosol particles. These are then transported into the free troposphere, a region of the atmosphere with very low human influence.""You can think of the whole Himalayas as an 'aerosol factory' that continuously produces a large amount of particles and then directly injects them high up into the atmosphere above the Everest,"" says Bianchi. We calculate from these measurements that the transport of particles may increase present-day particle concentration above the Himalayas by a factor of up to two or more.It's the first time the scientists consider mountain venting as a big potential source of atmospheric particles in the free troposphere.Additionally, the freshly formed particles have natural origin with little evidence of the involvement of anthropogenic pollutants. This process is therefore likely to be essentially unchanged since the pre-industrial period, and may have been one of the major sources contributing to the upper atmosphere aerosol population during that time. These new observations are therefore important to better estimate the pre-industrial baseline of aerosol concentrations in this large region.

Until now, however, it was unclear what factors led to these extreme events. Researchers from two Helmholtz Centres (AWI & UFZ) have now discovered that in Central Europe, temperature and precipitation patterns in April play a vital role in determining whether or not the soils are drier than average in the following summer. If the April is too warm, with little precipitation, a large proportion of the moisture stored in the soil evaporates, making a summer drought more likely. The team has also identified one of the reasons for the repeated dry Aprils and the correspondingly increased risk of drought. Decreasing temperature differences between the Arctic and the middle latitudes lead to a shift in the jet stream and the formation of a blocking high-pressure system over the North Sea and parts of Germany. This in turn means that the April weather in Central Europe is getting much too warm and dry, as the researchers report in a study released today in the Nature Partner Journals ","Monica Ionita, a climatologist and expert on weather forecasting at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), can still remember it clearly: in late April 2018, it was so hot in Bremen that she put a paddling pool in the garden for her daughter, although it should have been much too early to splash around outdoors. She now knows that the spring heat wave at the time provided the impetus for the following summer being one of the driest in the history of Central Europe.""Since the turn of the century, Central Europe has experienced repeated summer heat waves and droughts, which have caused damage amounting to millions of Euros. To date, attempts to correctly predict such extreme events have been unsuccessful because the influence of the spring has been underestimated. That is why we decided to closely investigate the links between the weather in spring and that in the subsequent summer -- for the entire period for which sufficient records are available. In other words, the last 140 years,"" the expert reports.For the analysis, Monica Ionita and her colleagues employed climate (and hydrologic) model outputs as well as statistical methods that the AWI researchers have developed; and had already successfully applied in long-term forecasts of river water levels. The findings show: in the last 14 years, the temperature and precipitation trends in April have changed fundamentally. ""While there was little change in the months of March and May in the period 2007 to 2020, April was on average 3 degrees Celsius warmer compared to the reference period 1961 to 2000. In extreme years, like 2018, it was so warm in April that the snow that had fallen in winter virtually evaporated before it had the chance to drain into the soil in the form of meltwater. Furthermore, since 2007, in most regions of Central Europe there has only been half as much rain as in the reference period,"" Ionita explains.In the past 14 years, the absence of precipitation has only been one of the problems: ""Rising April temperatures have led to the moisture stored in the soil evaporating. As a result, in spring there was already a marked lack of moisture in the soils of Central Europe, especially in Germany. As a rule, this deficit couldn't be compensated for in the summer. In other words: the summer drought in the soils was pre-programmed back in April,"" adds Rohini Kumar, a hydrologist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig and co-author of the new study.But which weather conditions over Central Europe cause the repeated record-high temperatures and dry spells in April? ""Our analysis shows that a blocking high-pressure system formed over the North Sea and parts of Germany in that period, and this diverted the jet stream northwards, resulting in spells of sunny and dry weather in Central Europe lasting up to two weeks,"" explains Ionita. There was also a phase with similarly low precipitation in April in the period from 1881 to 1895. But at the time it wasn't as warm, which meant that less moisture evaporated from the soil and there weren't the long-term effects that we're seeing today. ""The serious consequences of these spring dry spells are largely due to the rising air temperatures,"" comments Ionita.We can't yet say whether blocking high-pressure systems will determine the April weather in Central Europe in the future, since the climate is subject to natural fluctuations. But in their study, the scientists were able to identify one important driver: ""One reason for the formation of stable high-pressure areas is the decreasing temperature differences between the Arctic and the middle latitudes in spring. Under these conditions, the jet stream that controls the weather in Central Europe follows a zigzagging course, allowing the high-pressure system to settle over the North Sea,"" Ionita adds.According to climate scenarios, these initial conditions will also occur in the future. However, high-pressure systems will form less frequently (be less likely to form) if we succeed in achieving the Paris climate goals and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. ""If temperature increases exceed this goal, it is highly likely that such high-pressure areas will form. In Central Europe, the month of April will continue to be warmer and drier than it was 20-30 years ago, thus paving the way for large-scale water shortages and arid soils all summer long,"" warns the AWI researcher.""Such a development would have major effects on the soils' water balance and their associated ecosystem services,"" states Kumar, adding: ""In recent years, we've seen a series of summer droughts throughout Central Europe -- with severe consequences in terms of plant productivity and low water-levels in rivers.

The plume also has two branches in the lower mantle that feed into other plumes in the region, supplying heat to active regions in Iceland and Jan Mayen and the geothermal area in Svalbard.Their findings were based on measurements of the 3-D seismic velocity structure of the crust and whole mantle beneath these regions.

This scientific breakthrough concludes a long-lasting debate on the mechanisms causing abrupt climate change during the glacial period. It also documents that the cause of the swiftness and extent of sudden climate change must be found in the oceans.","During the last glacial period, app. 10,000 -- 110,000 years ago the northern hemisphere was covered in glacial ice and extensive sea ice, covering the Nordic seas. The cold glacial climate was interrupted by periods of fast warmup of up to 16.5 degrees Celsius over the Greenland ice sheet, the so called Dansgaard Oeschger events (D-O).These rapid glacial climate fluctuations were discovered in the Greenland ice core drillings decades ago, but the cause of them have been hotly contested. D-O events are of particular significance today as the rate of warming seems to be very much like what can be observed in large parts of the Arctic nowadays. The new results show that the abrupt climate change in the past was closely linked to the quick and extensive decline in sea ice cover in the Nordic seas. Very important knowledge as sea ice is presently decreasing each year.""Our, up until now, most extensive and detailed reconstruction of sea ice documents the importance of the rapid decrease of sea ice cover and the connected feedback mechanisms causing abrupt climate change,"" says Henrik Sadatzki, first author of the study.The Norwegian researchers investigated two sediment cores from the Norwegian sea and the Danish researchers investigated an ice core from East Greenland for changes in the sea ice cover. Both sediment and ice cores were meticulously dated and further linked to one another through several volcanic layers of ash (tephra) identified in both.Past sea ice cover was reconstructed in the marine cores by observing the relation between specific organic molecules produced by algea living in sea ice and others by algea living in ice free waters. In the Renland ice core from East Greenland the researchers looked at the content of Bromin. This content is connected to newly formed sea ice, since Bromin contents increase when sea ice is formed. A robust chronology and sea ice information in both sediment cores and the ice core could be established and used to investigate the extent of the sea ice changes in the Nordic seas during the last glacial period.""We have investigated how the sea ice cover changed during the last glacial period in both marine cores and ice cores. With the high resolution in our data sets we are able to see that the Nordic seas, during the rapid climate changes in the glacial period, change from being covered in ice all year round to having seasonal ice cover. This is knowledge we can apply in our improved understanding of how the sea ice decline we observe today may impact the climate in the Arctic,"" says Helle Astrid Kjær, Associate professor at the Ice, Climate and Geophysics section at the Niels Bohr Institute.The data the group of researchers present shows that the Nordic seas were covered by extensive sea ice in cold periods, while warmer periods are characterized by reduced, seasonal sea ice, as well as rather open ice free oceans. ""Our records show that the extensive decline in sea ice could have happened during a period of 250 years or less, simultaneously with a phase in which the water in the oceans to the north mixed with the Nordic sea, and that this situation led to sudden changes in atmospheric warming,"" says Henrik Sadatzki.As the Nordic seas changed abruptly from ice covered to open sea, the energy from the warmer ocean water was released to the cold atmosphere, leading to amplification of sudden warming of the climate. The result of the study documents that sea ice is a ""tipping element"" in the tightly coupled ocean-ice-climate system. This is particularly relevant today, as the still more open ocean to the north can lead to similar abrupt climate change.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has found that the abrupt climate change that occurred during the last glacial period was closely linked to the rapid decline in sea ice cover in the Nordic seas.

353,4-Dec-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201201084748.htm,Bacteria in iron-deficient environments process carbon sources selectively,"When humans have low iron levels, they tend to feel weak, fatigued and dizzy. This fatigue prevents patients with iron-deficient anemia from exercising or exerting themselves in order to conserve energy.","Similarly, in low-iron environments, microbes survive by slowing down carbon processing and extracting iron from minerals. However, this strategy requires microbes to invest precious food sources into producing mineral-dissolving compounds. Given this paradox, researchers wanted to understand how microbes sustain survival strategies in environments with too little iron to thrive.Iron is critical to carbon metabolism because it's required by the proteins involved in processing carbon. But because oxygen makes soluble iron less abundant in the environment, bacteria often operate under iron limitation and need to shut down or dramatically decrease carbon intake.Looking at a group of bacteria from soil, researchers at Northwestern University discovered that these organisms overcome limitation in their carbon processing machinery by rerouting their metabolic pathways to favor producing iron-scavenging compounds. The study is the first to use metabolomics, a high-resolution technique to monitor carbon flow in the cells, to study the impact of iron on the carbon cycling in bacterial cells.The study was published today (Nov. 30) in the journal Ludmilla Aristilde, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering, led the research. Her research group focuses on understanding environmental processes that involve organics, with implications for ecosystem health, agricultural productivity and environmental biotechnology.Within the network of metabolism in bacteria, the citric acid cycle provides the carbon skeletons needed to make iron-scavenging compounds. Metabolism of certain carbon sources generates better carbon and fuel from the citric acid cycle. Iron-starved bacteria favor carbon processing through the citric acid cycle in order to produce more iron-scavenging compounds. Aristilde said this finding is significant because the research reveals that inorganic nutrients can have a direct impact on organic processes.""The hierarchy in carbon metabolism highlights that selectivity in specific carbon usage is strongly linked to something that is inorganic,"" Aristilde said. ""To put this in the context of climate change, we need to understand what conditions control soil carbon cycling and its contribution to carbon dioxide.""By focusing on the Pseudomonas species in soils, the research group was able to make inferences about other species. The Pseudomonas bacteria also exist as human and plant pathogens, in our gut and elsewhere in the environment. Aristilde hopes that because the bacteria she and her researchers chose to study are so ubiquitous, future research will be able to use her group's findings as a roadmap.Past research studied organism behavior with a lower resolution of information. While scientists have used genomics to predict what may happen in metabolism of species based on identifying and measuring genes, the Aristilde lab uses metabolomics of the species to capture what is actually happening in metabolism. Their research provides clues that imply many other organisms and systems might also employ similar metabolic strategies.As an environmental engineer, Aristilde said that her area of study is all about understanding mechanisms and making predictions about how environmental processes like the carbon cycle behave. Beyond carbon cycling and climate change, the study also has implications in plant and human health. Understanding how bacteria that cause inflections change carbon metabolism to compete for iron in their plant or human hosts can enable researchers to better design target treatments.This study involved several students and researchers in the Aristilde lab, including current Ph.D. student Caroll Mendonca as the first author, former postdoctoral researcher Hua Wei, former M.S. student Samantha Sasnow and former undergraduate researchers Sho Yoshitake and Anne Werner as co-authors. The paper, ""Hierarchical Routing in Carbon Metabolism Favors Iron-Scavenging Strategy in Iron-Deficient Soil Pseudomonas species,"" was supported by the National Science Foundation (award number CBET-1653092).",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at Northwestern University have discovered that bacteria can reroute metabolic pathways in order to produce iron-scavenging compounds when starved of the inorganic nutrient. The bacteria, which were taken from soil, are forced to invest food sources into producing mineral-dissolving compounds when in low-iron environments. However, the researchers found that the organisms could overcome this limitation by favouring the production of iron-scavenging compounds. The study is the first to use metabolomics to monitor carbon flow in cells and its findings could have implications for ecosystem health, agricultural productivity and environmental biotechnology.",,

In the same way that you might change the way you forage for free snacks in the break room when your colleagues are present, plants change their use of underground resources when they're planted alongside other plants.","In a paper published today in ""This study was a lot of fun because it combined several different kinds of mind candy to reconcile seemingly contradictory results in the literature: a clever experiment, a new method for observing root systems in intact soils and simple mathematical theory,"" said Stephen Pacala, the Frederick D. Petrie Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and the senior author on the paper.""While the aboveground parts of plants have been extensively studied, including how much carbon they can store, we know much less about how belowground parts -- that is, roots -- store carbon,"" said Cabal, a Ph.D. student in Pacala's lab. ""As about a third of the world's vegetation biomass, hence carbon, is belowground, our model provides a valuable tool to predict root proliferation in global earth-system models.""Plants make two different types of roots: fine roots that absorb water and nutrients from the soil, and coarse transportation roots that transport these substances back to the plant's center. Plant ""investment"" in roots involves both the total volume of roots produced and the way in which these roots are distributed throughout the soil. A plant could concentrate all of its roots directly beneath its shoots, or it could spread its roots out horizontally to forage in the adjacent soil -- which risks competition with the roots of neighboring plants.The team's model predicted two potential outcomes for root investment when plants find themselves sharing soil. In the first outcome, the neighboring plants ""cooperate"" by segregating their root systems to reduce overlap, which leads to producing less roots overall than they would if they were solitary. In the second outcome, when a plant senses reduced resources on one side due to the presence of a neighbor, it shortens its root system on that side but invests more in roots directly below its stem.Natural selection predicts this second scenario, because each plant acts to increase its own fitness, regardless of how those actions impact other individuals. If plants are very close together, this increased investment in root volume, despite segregation of those roots, could result in a tragedy of the commons, whereby the resources (in this case, soil moisture and nutrients) are depleted.To test the model's predictions, the researchers grew pepper plants in a greenhouse both individually and in pairs. At the end of the experiment, they dyed the roots of the plants different colors so that they could easily see which roots belonged to which plant. Then, they calculated the total biomass of each plant's root system and the ratio of roots to shoots, to see whether plants changed how much energy and carbon they deposited into belowground and aboveground structures when planted alongside neighbors, and counted the number of seeds produced by each plant as a measure of relative fitness.The team discovered that the outcome depends on how close a pair of plants are to each other. If planted very close together, plants will be more likely to heavily invest in their root systems to try to outcompete each other for finite underground resources; if they are planted further apart, they will likely invest less in their root systems than a solitary plant would.Specifically, they found that when planted near others, pepper plants increased investment in roots locally and reduced how far they stretched their roots horizontally, to reduce overlap with neighbors. There was no evidence for a ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario, since there was no difference in the total root biomass or relative investment in roots compared to aboveground structures (including the number of seeds produced per plant) for solitary versus co-habiting plants.Plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and deposit it in their structures -- and a third of this vegetative carbon is stored in roots. Understanding how carbon deposition changes in different scenarios could help us more accurately predict carbon uptake, which in turn could help design strategies to mitigate climate change. This research could also help optimize food production, because in order to maximize crop yield, it's helpful to understand how to optimally use belowground (and aboveground) resources.",Climate,2020.0,"A team of researchers has developed a model to predict how plants invest in their root systems when sharing soil with neighboring plants.

Marine animals that need calcium carbonate for their skeletons or shells are called 'calcifiers'. Hard corals have skeletons, which is what gives reefs much of their three-dimensional (3D) structure. It's this structure that helps protect coasts -- and those living on the coasts -- from the brunt of waves, floods and storms. Without coral reefs the coasts 'drown'.A/Prof Dove says the amount of calcium carbonate within a coral reef ecosystem depends on the biomass of hard corals. But it also depends on the combined impact of warming and acidification on previously deposited calcium carbonate frameworks.

If the researchers' suspicions are correct, the newfound volcanic caldera would belong to the same category of volcanoes as the Yellowstone Caldera and other volcanoes that have had super-eruptions with severe global consequences.","The Islands of the Four Mountains in the central Aleutians is a tight group of six stratovolcanoes named Carlisle, Cleveland, Herbert, Kagamil, Tana and Uliaga. Stratovolcanoes are what most people envision when they think of a volcano: a steep conical mountain with a banner of clouds and ash waving at the summit. They can have powerful eruptions, like that of Mount St. Helens in 1980, but these are dwarfed by far less frequent caldera-forming eruptions.Researchers from a variety of institutions and disciplines have been studying Mount Cleveland, the most active volcano of the group, trying to understand the nature of the Islands of the Four Mountains. They have gathered multiple pieces of evidence showing that the islands could belong to one interconnected caldera.Unlike stratovolcanoes, which tend to tap small- to modestly-sized reservoirs of magma, a caldera is created by tapping a huge reservoir in the Earth's crust. When the reservoir's pressure exceeds the strength of the crust, gigantic amounts of lava and ash are released in a catastrophic episode of eruption.Caldera-forming eruptions are the most explosive volcanic eruptions on Earth and they often have had global effects. The ash and gas they put into the atmosphere can affect Earth's climate and trigger social upheaval. For example, the eruption of nearby Okmok volcano in the year BCE 43 has been recently implicated in the disruption of the Roman Republic. The proposed caldera underlying the Islands of the Four Mountains would be even larger than Okmok. If confirmed, it would become the first in the Aleutians that is hidden underwater, said Diana Roman of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., co-author of the study.""We've been scraping under the couch cushions for data,"" said Roman, referring to the difficulty of studying such a remote place. ""But everything we look at lines up with a caldera in this region.""Despite all these signs, Roman along with John Power, a researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey at the Alaska Volcano Observatory and the study's lead author, maintain that the existence of the caldera is not by any means proven. To do that the study team will need to return to the islands and gather more direct evidence to fully test their hypothesis.""Our hope is to return to the Islands of Four Mountains and look more closely at the seafloor, study the volcanic rocks in greater detail, collect more seismic and gravity data, and sample many more of the geothermal areas,"" Roman said.The caldera hypothesis might also help explain the frequent explosive activity seen at Mount Cleveland, Roman said. Mount Cleveland is arguably the most active volcano in North America for at least the last 20 years. It has produced ash clouds as high as 15,000 and 30,000 feet above sea level. These eruptions pose hazards to aircraft traveling the busy air routes between North America and Asia.""It does potentially help us understand what makes Cleveland so active,"" said Power, who will present the work. ""It can also help us understand what type of eruptions to expect in the future and better prepare for their hazards.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that the Islands of the Four Mountains in the central Aleutians could belong to one interconnected caldera, which would be even larger than the nearby Okmok volcano.

The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.With further development, these kinds of materials could offer exciting potential as a way of capturing solar energy during the summer months, and storing it for use in winter -- where less solar energy is available.This would prove invaluable for applications such as heating systems in off-grid systems or remote locations, or as an environmentally-friendly supplement to conventional heating in houses and offices. It could potentially also be produced as a thin coating and applied to the surface of buildings, or used on the windscreens of cars where the stored heat could be used to de-ice the glass in freezing winter mornings.The material is based on a type of 'metal-organic framework' (MOF). These consist of a network of metal ions linked by carbon-based molecules to form 3-D structures. A key property of MOFs is that they are porous, meaning that they can form composite materials by hosting other small molecules within their structures.The Lancaster research team set out to discover if a MOF composite, previously prepared by a separate research team at Kyoto University in Japan and known as 'DMOF1', can be used to store energy -- something not previously researched.The MOF pores were loaded with molecules of azobenzene -- a compound that strongly absorbs light. These molecules act as photoswitches, which are a type of 'molecular machine' that can change shape when an external stimulus, such as light or heat, is applied.In tests, the researchers exposed the material to UV light, which causes the azobenzene molecules to change shape to a strained configuration inside the MOF pores. This process stores the energy in a similar way to the potential energy of a bent spring. Importantly, the narrow MOF pores trap the azobenzene molecules in their strained shape, meaning that the potential energy can be stored for long periods of time at room temperature.The energy is released again when external heat is applied as a trigger to 'switch' its state, and this release can be very quick -- a bit like a spring snapping back straight. This provides a heat boost which could be used to warm other materials of devices.Further tests showed the material was able to store the energy for at least four months. This is an exciting aspect of the discovery as many light-responsive materials switch back within hours or a few days. The long duration of the stored energy opens up possibilities for cross-seasonal storage.The concept of storing solar energy in photoswitches has been studied before, but most previous examples have required the photoswitches to be in a liquid. Because the MOF composite is a solid, and not a liquid fuel, it is chemically stable and easily contained. This makes it much easier to develop into coatings or standalone devices.Dr John Griffin, Senior Lecturer in Materials Chemistry at Lancaster University and joint Principal Investigator of the study, said: ""The material functions a bit like phase change materials, which are used to supply heat in hand warmers. However, while hand warmers need to be heated in order to recharge them, the nice thing about this material is that it captures ""free"" energy directly from the sun. It also has no moving or electronic parts and so there are no losses involved in the storage and release of the solar energy. We hope that with further development we will be able to make other materials which store even more energy.""These proof-of-concept findings open up new avenues of research to see what other porous materials might have good energy storage properties using the concept of confined photoswitches.Joint investigator Dr Nathan Halcovitch added: ""Our approach means that there are a number of ways to try to optimise these materials either by changing the photoswitch itself, or the porous host framework.""Other potential applications for crystalline materials containing photoswitch molecules include data storage -- the well-defined arrangement of photoswitches in the crystal structure means that they could in principle be switched one-by-one using a precise light source and therefore store data like on a CD or DVD, but at a molecular level. They also have potential for drug delivery -- drugs could be locked inside a material using photoswitches and then released on demand inside the body using a light or heat trigger.Although the results were promising for this material's ability to store energy for long periods of time, its energy density was modest. Next steps are to research other MOF structures as well as alternative types of crystalline materials with greater energy storage potential.The research, which was supported by the Leverhulme Trust, is outlined in the paper 'Long-Term Solar Energy Storage under Ambient Conditions in a MOF-Based Solid-Solid Phase Change Material', which has been published by the journal The researchers are John Griffin, Kieran Griffiths and Nathan Halcovitch, all of Lancaster University's Department of Chemistry.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers from Lancaster University have discovered that a crystalline material has the ability to capture energy from the sun, which can be stored for several months at room temperature and then released as heat on demand.

Depending on conditions, rollers move a sheet back and forth to expose either heat-trapping materials on one half or cooling materials on the other. Specially designed at the nanoscale, one material absorbs the sun's energy and traps existing heat, while the other reflects light and allows heat to escape through the Earth's atmosphere and into space.""I think we are the first to demonstrate a reversible thermal contact, which allows us to switch between the two modes for heating or cooling,"" said Po-Chun Hsu, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke and leader of the team. ""This allows the material to be movable while still maintaining a good thermal contact with the building to either bring heat in or let heat out.""The results appeared online November 30, in the journal About 15% of energy consumption in the U.S., and more than 30% globally, is for the heating and cooling of buildings, which is responsible for about 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, up to now, most approaches to minimize the carbon footprint have only addressed either heating or cooling. That leaves the world's temperate climate zones that require both heating and cooling during the year -- or sometimes in a single 24 hours -- out in the cold. In the new paper, Hsu and his team demonstrate a device that potentially could keep us either cozy or cool as the weather changes.The specially designed sheet starts with a polymer composite as the base that can expand or contract by running electricity through it. This allows the device to maintain contact with the building for transmitting energy while still being able to disengage so that the rollers can switch between modes.The cooling portion of the sheet has an ultra-thin silver film covered by an even thinner layer of clear silicone, which together reflect the sun's rays like a mirror. The unique properties of these materials also convert energy into and emit mid-range infrared light, which does not interact with the gasses in the Earth's atmosphere and easily passes into outer space.When a change in weather brings the need for heating, the electrical charge releases and the rollers pull the sheet along a track. This swaps the cooling, reflective half of the sheet for the heat-absorbing half.To heat the building beneath, the engineers used an ultra-thin layer of copper topped by a layer of zinc-copper nanoparticles. By making the nanoparticles a specific size and spacing them a certain distance apart, they interact with the copper beneath them in a way that traps light onto their surface, allowing the material to absorb more than 93% of the sunlight's heat.Hsu and his team see the device as something that could work with existing HVAC systems, rather than a full replacement.""Instead of directly heating and cooling the building, we could use a water panel to take hot or cold water to a heat pump or boiler system,"" said Hus. ""I also imagine that with additional engineering, this could also be used on walls, forming a sort of switchable building envelop."" said Hsu.Moving forward, the team is working on several aspects of the design to advance it from a prototype to one scalable for manufacturing. Among these, explained Hsu, are concerns about the long-term wear and tear of the moving parts and costs of the specialized materials. For example, they will investigate whether lower-cost aluminum can substitute for the silver and are also working on a static version that can switch modes chemically rather than mechanically.Despite the many obstacles, Hsu believes this technology could be an energy-saving boon in the future. And he's not alone.""We're already working with a company to determine the ideal locations for deploying this technology,"" said Hsu. ""And because almost every climate zone in the United States requires both heating and cooling at some point throughout the year, the advantages of a dual-mode device such as this are obvious.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at Duke University have developed a device that can switch between heating and cooling modes to maintain a comfortable temperature in buildings.

Most recently reached by Superstorm Sandy, 500-year flood levels would become a 143-year flood level, and then a four-year flood level by the end of the century. Additionally, sea-level rise would result in larger waves which could lead to more flood hazards such as erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure.""Future projections of the hurricane climatology suggest that climate change would lead to storms that move more slowly and are more intense than we have ever seen before hitting Jamaica Bay,"" said Marsooli.

At current rates of melting, it contributes almost 1mm to sea level per year, and accounts for around a quarter of total sea level rise.Since 2003, despite seasonal periods of growth, Greenland's ice sheet has lost three and a half trillion tonnes of ice.Rising sea levels are one of the most severe effects of climate change, threatening coastal areas around the world, and putting millions of people who live in low-lying areas at risk. Bangladesh, Florida, and eastern England are among many areas known to be particularly vulnerable.Under scenarios in which global warming goes beyond 2°C, the Paris Agreement target, we should expect significant ice loss and several metres of global sea level rise to persist for tens of thousands of years, according to the new research. The warmer the climate, the greater the sea-level rise.In addition, even if temperatures later return to current levels, scientists have shown that the Greenland ice sheet will never fully regrow once it melts beyond a critical point. After that point, sea levels would permanently remain two meters higher than now, regardless of other factors contributing to sea level rise.This is because the ice sheet is so large that it has a substantial impact on its local climate, and as it declines, Greenland would experience warmer temperatures and less snowfall.Once the ice-sheet retreats from the Northern part of the island, the area would remain ice-free.To avoid the irreversible sea level rise the melting would cause, scientists say that climate change must be reversed before the ice sheet has declined to the threshold mass, which would be reached in about 600 years at the highest rate of mass loss within the likely range of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Professor Jonathan Gregory, Climate Scientist from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Reading, said: ""Our experiments underline the importance of mitigating global temperature rise. To avoid partially irreversible loss of the ice sheet, climate change must be reversed -- not just stabilised -- before we reach the critical point where the ice sheet has declined too far.""To study the ice-sheet, scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science simulated the effects of Greenland ice sheet melting under a range of possible temperature rises, ranging from minimal warming to worst-case scenarios.Under all future climates like the present or warmer, the ice-sheet declined in size and contributed to some degree of sea-level rise.Importantly, there were scenarios in which the ice sheet melting could be reversed.

When their interpretation is combined with previous work, including work from other Penn State researchers, it suggests that continents took roughly 500 million years to rise to their modern heights, according to findings recently published in To reach this conclusion, scientists applied a unique statistical analysis to crystallization ages from the mineral zircon, which is reliably dateable and is frequently found in sedimentary rocks. While these researchers did not date these samples, the samples were all dated using the the uranium-lead decay system. This method measures the amount of lead in a sample and calculates from the well established rate of uranium decay, the age of the crystal. When zirconium forms, no lead is incorporated into its structure, so any lead is from uranium decay.The minerals found in the sedimentary rock samples originally formed in older magmas but, through erosion and transport, traveled in rivers and were eventually deposited in the ocean where they were turned into sedimentary rock beneath the surface of the sea floor. The ages of zircons retrieved from individual rock samples can be used to tell the type of continent they were eroded from.The ages of zircons from Eastern North American rocks are, for instance, different from those of land masses such as Japan, which was formed by much more recent volcanic activity.""If you look at the Mississippi River, it's eroding rocks and zircons from all over North America. It's gathering mineral grains that have a massive age range from as young as a million years to as old as a few billions of years,"" Reimink said. ""Our analysis suggests that as soon as sediment started to be formed on Earth they were formed from sedimentary basins with a similarly large age range.""Sediments are formed from weathering of older rocks, and carry the signature of past landmass in time capsules such as zircons. The research doesn't uncover the overall size of primordial continents, but it does speculate that modern-scale watersheds were formed as early as 2.7 billion years ago.""Our research matches nicely with the preserved rock record,"" Reimink said.This finding is critical for a few reasons. First, knowing when and how the continents formed advances research on the carbon cycle in the land, water and atmosphere. Secondly, it gives us clues as to the early origins of Earth. That could prove useful as we discover more about life and the formation of other planets. Earth is a life-sustaining planet, in part, because of how continental crust influences our atmospheric and oceanic composition. Knowing how and when these processes occurred could hold clues to the creation of life.""Whenever we're able to determine processes that led to our existence, it relates to the really profound questions such as: Are we unique? Is Earth unique in the universe? And are there other Earths out there,"" Reimink said. ""These findings help lead us down the path to the answers we need about Earth that allow us to compare our planet to others.""The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada partially supported this work.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at Penn State have used statistical analysis of around 600,000 mineral analyses from a database of 7,700 rock samples to determine that Earth's land masses began to slowly rise above sea level around 3 billion years ago.

Pangea broke apart about 200 million years ago, its pieces drifting away on the tectonic plates -- but not permanently. The continents will reunite again in the deep future. And a new study, presented today during an online poster session at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union, suggests that the future arrangement of this supercontinent could dramatically impact the habitability and climate stability of Earth. The findings also have implications for searching for life on other planets.","The study, which has been submitted for publication, is the first to model the climate on a supercontinent in the deep future.Scientists aren't exactly sure what the next supercontinent will look like or where it will be located. One possibility is that, 200 million years from now, all the continents except Antarctica could join together around the north pole, forming the supercontinent ""Amasia."" Another possibility is that ""Aurica"" could form from all the continents coming together around the equator in about 250 million years.In the new study, researchers used a 3D global climate model to simulate how these two land mass arrangements would affect the global climate system. The research was led by Michael Way, a physicist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, an affiliate of Columbia University's Earth Institute.The team found that, by changing atmospheric and ocean circulation, Amasia and Aurica would have profoundly different effects on the climate. The planet could end up being 3 degrees Celsius warmer if the continents all converge around the equator in the Aurica scenario.In the Amasia scenario, with the land amassed around both poles, the lack of land in between disrupts the ocean conveyor belt that currently carries heat from the equator to the poles. As a result, the poles would be colder and covered in ice all year long. And all of that ice would reflect heat out into space.With Amasia, ""you get a lot more snowfall,"" explained Way. ""You get ice sheets, and you get this very effective ice-albedo feedback, which tends to lower the temperature of the planet.""In addition to cooler temperatures, Way suggested that sea level would probably be lower in the Amasia scenario, with more water tied up in the ice caps, and that the snowy conditions could mean that there wouldn't be much land available for growing crops.Aurica, by contrast, would probably be a bit beachier, he said. The land concentrated closer to the equator would absorb the stronger sunlight there, and there would be no polar ice caps to reflect heat out of Earth's atmosphere -- hence the higher global temperature.Although Way likens Aurica's shores to the paradisiacal beaches of Brazil, ""the inland would probably be quite dry,"" he warned. Whether or not much of the land would be farmable would depend on the distribution of lakes and what types of precipitation patterns it experiences -- details that the current paper doesn't delve into, but could be investigated in the future.The simulations showed that temperatures were right for liquid water to exist on about 60% of Amasia's land, as opposed to 99.8% of Aurica's -- a finding that could inform the search for life on other planets. One of the main factors that astronomers look for when scoping out potentially habitable worlds is whether or not liquid water could survive on the planet's surface. When modeling these other worlds, they tend to simulate planets that are either completely covered in oceans, or else whose terrain looks like that of modern-day Earth. The new study, however, shows that it's important to consider land mass arrangements while estimating whether temperatures fall in the 'habitable' zone between freezing and boiling.Although it may be 10 or more years before scientists can ascertain the actual land and sea distribution on planets in other star systems, the researchers hope that having a larger library of land and sea arrangements for climate modeling could prove useful in estimating the potential habitability of neighboring worlds.Hannah Davies and Joao Duarte from the University of Lisbon, and Mattias Green from Bangor University in Wales were co-authors on this research.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has modelled the climate of two possible future supercontinents, Amasia and Aurica.

By 2055, they project it would cost as much as $393 billion per year to pay landowners to plant and protect enough trees to achieve more than 10 percent of total emissions reductions that international policy experts say are needed to restrict climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

""The physical potential is there, but when we look at the economic costs, they are nonlinear. That means that the more we reduce emissions -- the more carbon we're sequestering -- we're paying higher and higher costs for it.""The researchers found that The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects forestry to play a critical role in reducing climate change. To analyze the cost of preserving forest, preventing harvest and deforestation, and planting trees, researchers used a price model called the Global Timber Model. That model estimates costs of preserving trees in private forests owned and managed by companies for harvesting for pulp and paper products, as well as on publicly owned land, such as U.S. national parks.""Protecting, managing and restoring the world's forests will be necessary for avoiding dangerous impacts of climate change, and have important co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service enhancement and protection of livelihoods,"" said Kemen Austin, lead author of the study and senior policy analyst at RTI. ""Until now, there has been limited research investigating the costs of climate change mitigation from forests. Better understanding the costs of mitigation from global forests will help us to prioritize resources and inform the design of more efficient mitigation policies.""The researchers estimated it would cost $2 billion per year to prevent 0.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide from being released by 2055. Comparatively, $393 billion annually would sequester 6 gigatons, or the equivalent of emissions from nearly 1.3 billion passenger vehicles driven for one year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.""It's not clear from these results that you'll have consistent low-cost mitigation from the global forest sector as other studies have indicated,"" Baker said.The tropics are expected to play the biggest role in reducing emissions, with Brazil -- the country that contains the largest share of the Amazon rainforest -- the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Indonesia contributing the largest share.

366,1-Dec-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201201124117.htm,New research reveals 'megatrends' that will affect forests in the next decade,"A group of experts from academic, governmental and international organisations have identified five large-scale 'megatrends' affecting forests and forest communities, published today in ","Around the world, 1.6 billion people live within 5km of a forest, and millions rely on them for their livelihoods, especially in poorer countries. They are also home to much of the world's biodiversity, and regulate key aspects of the carbon cycle. In short, forests are vital in global and national efforts to combat climate change and biodiversity loss, and eradicate hunger and poverty.Despite their importance, research on forests and livelihoods to date has mainly focused on understanding local household and community-level dynamics -- identifying the links between human and natural systems at the regional and global scales is critical for future policy and action.The five trends revealed by the research are:Droughts and excessive precipitation are increasing forests' susceptibility to diseases and human-induced wildfires and floods -- this is leading to defoliation, tree mortality and declines in forest productivity at unprecedented scales, and there is increasing evidence that forest disturbance can result in the emergence of diseases with the ability to spread globally.Policy responses to these disturbances will require balancing a range of mitigation and adaptation efforts -- whilst opportunities and challenges are likely to arise from efforts to align forest conservation and restoration with other sustainability priorities, such as poverty alleviation.Increased migration to urban areas is causing an unprecedented exodus among forest-reliant communities. The effects of these demographic shifts, including forest resurgence on formerly agricultural lands and participation in decision-making, are not well understood.Populations shifts could result in opportunities for effective forest conservation, whilst on the other hand could lead to deforestation as greater urban demand and large industrial projects are created.By 2030 the middle class in low and middle income countries will grow to almost 5 billion people -- around 50% of the global population. The growth in demand that this creates will increase pressure on land and other resources.Growing consumption and demand of commodities has already seen large scale corporate-led land acquisitions for industrial production of cattle, soy and palm oil in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Between 2001-2015, 27% of forest disturbance was attributed to commodity-driven deforestation. Further growth in demand and a continuing culture of consumerism will alter local and global consumption patterns, with potentially severe effects on deforestation rates, emissions, wildlife populations, ecosystem services and rural communities.Access to digital communication technology has grown exponentially in recent years, with a sevenfold increase in internet and mobile cellular use since 2000. The majority of this growth has come outside industrialised countries, and is likely to have a transformational impact on the forest sector. Technologies that collect and disseminate data are increasingly accurate and easy-to-use, including land mapping tools, real-time satellite data and crowd-sourced data.Although they can be accessed by those involved in illicit activity such as logging and mining, these technologies also provide opportunities. Increasingly available data can benefit a wide range of forest sector stakeholders including policymakers, oversight bodies, non-governmental actors, managers and local communities. New technologies are already supporting the surveillance and certification of global production networks, which is aiding regulatory control of forest-based products and people threatening forests.Large scale infrastructure projects such as China's Belt and Road initiative are likely to have transformational impacts on forests and rural communities. To accommodate demand for energy, natural resources and transport, many countries have planned ambitious infrastructure growth.By 2050, there is expected to be at least 25 million km of new roads globally to help facilitate commodity flow between transport hubs; governments in the Amazon basin alone are developing 246 new hydroelectric dams; and illegal mining activities are expanding rapidly across the globe. These can lead to forest loss, displaces people, disrupts livelihoods and provokes social conflicts as communities lose access to land and resources.These five megatrends are creating new agricultural and urban frontiers, changing landscapes, opening spaces for conservation and facilitating an unprecedented development of monitoring platforms that can be used by local communities, civil society organisations, governments and international donors. Understanding these larger-scale dynamics is key to support not only the critical role of forests in meeting livelihood aspirations locally, but also a range of other sustainability challenges globally.""Our study allows us to take stock of key socioeconomic, political and environmental issues affecting forests and rural communities, and identify trends likely to have disproportionate impacts on forests and forest-livelihoods in the coming decade,"" says Johan Oldekop, an associate professor in the Global Development Institute at the University of Manchester and a lead author of the report.""The trends we identify are important, because they represent human and environmental processes that are exceptionally large in geographical extent and magnitude, and are difficult to reverse,"" Oldekop says. ""Developing a new research agenda that is able to better understand these trends and identify levers of change will require novel ways of combining new and existing data sources, the strengthening of existing collaborations between researchers, local communities and policymakers, as well as the development of new types of partnerships with public and private stakeholders.""""The assembled expert panel is unique as it brings together a range of subject expertise, region-specific knowledge, as well as academic, governmental and non-governmental institutions, including international donor organizations,"" adds Laura Vang Rasmussen, an assistant professor in the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management at the University of Copenhagen, and one of the lead authors of the report.",Climate,2020.0,"Forests are vital in global efforts to combat climate change and biodiversity loss, and eradicate hunger and poverty, according to a report from the International Union of Forest Research Organizations.

One of the better known: the continually shrinking summer sea-ice extent in the Arctic. But global warming is also leaving its mark on terrestrial permafrost. For several years, permafrost regions have been thawing more and more intensively in North America, Scandinavia and Siberia -- e.g. in the extreme northwest of Alaska. Permafrost is soil that has remained permanently frozen to depths of up to several hundred metres, often since the last glacial period, roughly 20,000 years ago, or in some cases even longer.","The permafrost regions near the city of Kotzebue, Alaska, are dotted with hundreds of thaw lakes. These are formed when the permafrost soils begin to thaw and subside. Meltwater from the soil or from the winter snowfall and summer rainfall collects in the hollows. Some are several thousand years old and were formed since the end of the last glacial period. But in recent years, the lake landscape has changed due to more frequent relatively mild winters there. In summer, the permafrost soils thaw extensively and they don't completely refreeze in winter, which means that the lakes' shores become unstable and collapse, causing water to drain from the lakes. Researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) observed a particularly extreme example of this in the seasons 2017 and 2018: within a year, more lakes drained than ever before -- roughly 190 in total. ""The scale shocked us,"" says AWI geographer Ingmar Nitze. ""The winter 2017/2018 was extremely wet and warm. Conditions were similar to those our climate models predict will be normal by the end of this century. In a way, we caught a glimpse of the future.

In the pictures, the full and drained lakes can be easily distinguished. It is also clear when the lakes begin to drain. Winter 2017/2018 was the warmest in the region since continuous records began at the Kotzebue station in 1949. Accordingly, the experts had expected several lakes to drain. But they hadn't expected it to happen on this scale. ""In the mild years 2005 and 2006, several lakes drained -- but this time there were twice as many.""

368,30-Nov-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201130155832.htm,An escape route for seafloor methane,"Methane, the main component of natural gas, is the cleanest-burning of all the fossil fuels, but when emitted into the atmosphere it is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. By some estimates, seafloor methane contained in frozen formations along the continental margins may equal or exceed the total amount of coal, oil, and gas in all other reservoirs worldwide. Yet, the way methane escapes from these deep formations is poorly understood.","In particular, scientists have been faced with a puzzle. Observations at sites around the world have shown vigorous columns of methane gas bubbling up from these formations in some places, yet the high pressure and low temperature of these deep-sea environments should create a solid frozen layer that would be expected to act as a kind of capstone, preventing gas from escaping. So how does the gas get out?A new study helps explain how and why columns of the gas can stream out of these formations, known as methane hydrates. Using a combination of deep-sea observations, laboratory experiments, and computer modeling, researchers have found phenomena that explain and predict the way the gas breaks free from the icy grip of a frozen mix of water and methane. The findings are reported today in the journal Surprisingly, not only does the frozen hydrate formation fail to prevent methane gas from escaping into the ocean column, but in some cases it actually facilitates that escape.Early on, Fu saw photos and videos showing plumes of methane, taken from a NOAA research ship in the Gulf of Mexico, revealing the process of bubble formation right at the seafloor. It was clear that the bubbles themselves often formed with a frozen crust around them, and would float upward with their icy shells like tiny helium balloons.Later, Fu used sonar to detect similar bubble plumes from a research ship off the coast of Virginia. ""This cruise alone detected thousands of these plumes,"" says Fu, who led the research project while a graduate student and postdoc at MIT. ""We could follow these methane bubbles encrusted by hydrate shells into the water column,"" she says. ""That's when we first knew that hydrate forming on these gas interfaces can be a very common occurrence.""But exactly what was going on beneath the seafloor to trigger the release of these bubbles remained unknown. Through a series of lab experiments and simulations, the mechanisms at work gradually became apparent.Seismic studies of the subsurface of the seafloor in these vent regions show a series of relatively narrow conduits, or chimneys, through which the gas escapes. But the presence of chunks of gas hydrate from these same formations made it clear that the solid hydrate and the gaseous methane could co-exist, Fu explains. To simulate the conditions in the lab, the researchers used a small two-dimensional setup, sandwiching a gas bubble in a layer of water between two plates of glass under high pressure.As a gas tries to rise through the seafloor, Fu says, if it's forming a hydrate layer when it hits the cold seawater, that should block its progress: ""It's running into a wall. So how would that wall not be preventing it from continuous migration?"" Using the microfluidic experiments, they found a previously unknown phenomenon at work, which they dubbed crustal fingering.If the gas bubble starts to expand, ""what we saw is that the expansion of the gas was able to create enough pressure to essentially rupture the hydrate shell. And it's almost like it's hatching out of its own shell,"" Fu says. But instead of each rupture freezing back over with the reforming hydrate, the hydrate formation takes place along the sides of the rising bubble, creating a kind of tube around the bubble as it moves upward. ""It's almost like the gas bubble is able to chisel out its own path, and that path is walled by the hydrate solid,"" she says. This phenomenon they observed at small scale in the lab, their analysis suggests, is also what would also happen at much larger scale in the seafloor.That observation, she said, ""was really the first time we've been aware of a phenomenon like this that could explain how hydrate formation will not inhibit gas flow, but rather in this case, it would facilitate it,"" by providing a conduit and directing the flow. Without that focusing, the flow of gas would be much more diffuse and spread out.As the crust of hydrate forms, it slows down the formation of more hydrate because it forms a barrier between the gas and the seawater. The methane below the barrier can therefore persist in its unfrozen, gaseous form for a long time. The combination of these two phenomena -- the focusing effect of the hydrate-walled channels and the segregation of the methane gas from the water by a hydrate layer -- ""goes a long way toward explaining why you can have some of this vigorous venting, thanks to the hydrate formation, rather than being prevented by it,"" says Juanes.A better understanding of the process could help in predicting where and when such methane seeps will be found, and how changes in environmental conditions could affect the distribution and output of these seeps. While there have been suggestions that a warming climate could increase the rate of such venting, Fu says there is little evidence of that so far. She notes that temperatures at the depths where these formations occur -- 600 meters (1,900 feet) deep or more -- are expected to experience a smaller temperature increase than would be needed to trigger a widespread release of the frozen gas.Some researchers have suggested that these vast undersea methane formations might someday be harnessed for energy production. Though there would be great technical hurdles to such use, Juanes says, these findings might help in assessing the possibilities.""The problem of how gas can move through the hydrate stability zone, where we would expect the gas to be immobilized by being converted to hydrate, and instead escape at the seafloor, is still not fully understood,"" says Hugh Daigle, an associate professor of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not associated with this research. ""This work presents a probable new mechanism that could plausibly allow this process to occur, and nicely integrates previous laboratory observations with modeling at a larger scale.""""In a practical sense, the work here takes a phenomenon at a small scale and allows us to use it in a model that only considers larger scales, and will be very useful for implementing in future work,"" Daigle says.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have discovered how and why methane gas can escape from formations known as methane hydrates, despite the high pressure and low temperature of deep-sea environments that should create a solid frozen layer.

The new study, based on the rings of ancient trees in and around the river's watershed, shows that the post-1950s period was actually one of the driest since the 1300s. The rings show that there have been much wetter periods in the past, driven by natural oscillations that took place over decades or centuries. The takeaway: destructive floods probably will come more frequently than scientists have thought, even minus any effects of human-driven climate change. Estimates probably fall short by nearly 40 percent, say the researchers. The findings were just published in the journal ""The tree rings suggest that the long-term baseline conditions are much wetter than we thought,"" said Mukund Palat Rao, a PhD. student at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and lead author of the study. ""Whether you consider climate models or natural variability, the message is the same. We should be prepared for a higher frequency of flooding than we are currently predicting.""The Brahmaputra is one of the world's mightiest rivers, flowing under a variety of names and braided routes some 2,900 miles through Tibet, northeast India and Bangladesh. Near its mouth, it combines with India's Ganga River to create the world's third largest ocean outflow, behind only the Amazon and the Congo. (It is tied with Venezuela's Orinoco.) At points, it is nearly 12 miles wide. Its delta alone is home to 130 million Bangladeshis, and many millions more live upstream.The river routinely floods surrounding areas during the July-September monsoon season, when moisture-laden winds sweep in from the Indian Ocean and bring rain along its length, from its Himalayan headwaters on down to the coastal plain. As with the Nile, the flooding has a good side, because the waters drop nutrient-rich sediment to replenish farmland, and some degree of flooding is essential for rice cultivation. But some years, the flooding runs out of control, and low-lying Bangladesh gets hit hardest. In 1998, 70 percent of the country went underwater, taking out crops, roads and buildings, and killing many people. Other serious floods came in 2007 and 2010. In September 2020 the worst flooding since 1998 was still underway, with a third of Bangladesh inundated, and 3 million people rendered homeless.Higher temperatures drive more evaporation of ocean waters, and in this region that water ends up as rainfall on land during the monsoon. As a result, most scientists think that warming climate will intensify the monsoon rains in coming decades, and in turn increase seasonal flooding. The question is, how much more often might big floods happen in the future?The authors of the new study first looked at records from a river-flow gauge in northern Bangladesh. This showed a median discharge some 41,000 cubic meters per second from 1956 to 1986, and 43,000 from 1987 to 2004. (In the big flood year of 1998, peak discharge more than doubled.)They then looked at data from the rings of ancient trees that researchers sampled at 28 sites in Tibet, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan, at sites within the Brahmaputra watershed, or close enough to be affected by the same weather systems. Most samples were taken from conifer species in the last 20 years by scientists from the Lamont-Doherty Tree Ring Lab, led by study coauthor Edward Cook. Since people have long been cutting down trees in populous areas, Cook and his colleagues sometimes hiked for weeks to reach undisturbed sites in remote, mountainous terrain. Straw-width samples were bored from trunks, without damage to the trees. The oldest tree they found, a Tibetan juniper, dated to the year 449.Back at the lab, they analyzed the tree rings, which grow wider in years when soil moisture is high, and thus indirectly reflect rainfall and resulting river runoff. This allowed the scientists to assemble a 696-year chronology, running from 1309 to 2004. By comparing the rings with modern instrumental records as well as historical records going back to the 1780s, they could see that the widest rings lined up neatly with known major flood years. This in turn allowed them to extrapolate yearly river discharge in the centuries preceding modern records. They found that 1956-1986 was in only the 13th percentile for river discharge, and 1987-2004 in the 22nd.This, they say, means that anyone using the modern discharge record to estimate future flood hazard would be underestimating the danger by 24 to 38 percent, based solely on natural variations; human driven warming would have to be added on top of that. ""If the instruments say we should expect flooding toward the end of the century to come about every four and a half years, we are saying we should really expect flooding to come about every three years,"" said Rao.The tree rings do show some other relatively dry times, in the 1400s, 1600s and 1800s. But they also show very wet periods of extreme flooding with no analog in the relatively brief modern instrumental period. The worst lasted from about 1560-1600, 1750-1800 and 1830-1860.Climate change will almost certainly affect the flow of other major rivers in the region, though not necessarily in the same ways. The mighty Ganga, flowing mainly through India, is also powered mainly by the monsoon, so it will likely behave much like the Brahmaputra. But the Indus, which flows through Tibet, India and Pakistan, derives most of its flow not from the monsoon, but rather from the winter buildup of snow and ice in Himalayan glaciers, and subsequent melting in summer. In 2018 Rao and colleagues published a tree-ring study showing that the river's flow has been anomalously high in recent years. They suggest that as climate warms and the glaciers undergo accelerated melting, the Indus will supply plenty of needed irrigation water -- but at some point, when the glaciers lose enough mass, the seasonal spigot will turn the other way, and there may not be enough water.Human vulnerability to floods along the Brahmaputra has increased in recent years due not only to sheer water volume, but because population and infrastructure are growing fast. On the other hand, accurate flood warnings have become more advanced, and this has helped many villages reduce economic and social losses. ""High discharges will continue to be associated with an increased likelihood of flood hazard in the future,"" write the study authors. But, they say, this could be counteracted to some extent by ""potential changes in policy, land use, or infrastructure that may ameliorate flood risk.""The study was also coauthored by Benjamin Cook, Rosanne D'Arrigo, Brendan Buckley and Daniel Bishop, all affiliated with the Lamont-Doherty Tree Ring Lab; Upmanu Lall of the Columbia Water Center; Columbia University ecologist Maria Uriarte; and collaborators at other U.S. universities and in Australia and China.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study based on tree rings of ancient trees in and around the Brahmaputra river's watershed reveals that the post-1950s period was actually one of the driest since the 1300s.

But new research from the University of Colorado Boulder finds that these high-emissions scenarios, used as baseline projections in the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global assessments, have not accurately reflected the slowing rate of growth in the global economy and we are unlikely to catch up to them anytime soon.","The new study, published today in The good news: Emissions are not growing nearly as fast as IPCC assessments have indicated, according to the study's authors. The bad news: The IPCC is not using the most accurate and up-to-date climate scenarios in its planning and policy recommendations.""If we're making policy based on anticipating future possibilities, then we should be using the most realistic scenarios possible,"" said Matt Burgess, lead author on the study and a fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU Boulder. ""We'll have better policies as a result.""The IPCC was established in 1988 and provides policymakers around the globe with regular research-based assessments on the current and projected impacts of climate change. Its reports, the sixth of which is due out in 2022, play an instrumental role in shaping global climate policy.To see if IPCC scenarios are on track, the researchers compared projections from the latest report, published in 2014, and data used to prepare the upcoming report, to data gathered from 2005 to 2017 on country-level gross domestic product (GDP), fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions, likely energy use and population trends during this century. Burgess and his co-authors show that even before the pandemic, due to slower-than-projected per-capita GDP growth, as well a declining global use of coal, these high-emissions scenarios were already well off-track in 2020, and look likely to continue to diverge from reality over the coming decades and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic's dampening effect on the global economy only accentuates their findings, they said.As a result, they contend that these high-emissions scenarios should not be used as the baseline scenarios in global climate assessments, which aim to represent where the world is headed without additional climate mitigation policy.When it comes to climate change scenarios, some scientists and climate experts fear that economic growth will be higher than the projected scenarios, and we'll be taken by surprise by climate changes. But that is unlikely to happen, according to Burgess, assistant professor in environmental studies and faculty affiliate in economics.This new research adds to a growing literature that argues that economic growth and energy use are currently over-projected for this century. The research also points out that the high-emissions scenarios used by the IPCC don't fully account for economic damages from climate change.The researchers recommend that these policy-relevant scenarios should be frequently recalibrated to reflect economic crashes, technological discoveries, or other real-time changes in society and Earth's climate. Anticipating the future is difficult and updates are to be expected, according to Roger Pielke Jr., co-author on the paper and professor of environmental studies.Their study does not mean that people can let their guard down when it comes to addressing climate change, the authors stress. No matter the scenario, the only way to get to net zero emissions as a society is to dramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions from our energy sources.""We're still affecting the climate and the challenge of reducing emissions is as hard as ever,"" said Pielke Jr. ""Just because it's not the worst-case scenario doesn't mean that the problem goes away.""Additional co-authors on this paper include John Shapland in Environmental Studies at CU Boulder and Justin Ritchie of the University of British Columbia's Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change suggests that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is not using the most accurate and up-to-date climate scenarios in its planning and policy recommendations.

The researchers analysed data that they had obtained from deep-sea sediments dating back approximately 2.5 million years.

This process, called leaf senescence, allows trees to prepare for the coming winter by suspending their growth and extracting nutrients from the foliage. In the trees' phenological cycle, leaf senescence marks the end of the productive period during which they absorb COGlobal warming has resulted in longer vegetation periods in recent years, with spring leaf emergence in European trees happening about two weeks earlier than 100 years ago and autumn senescence about six days later. It is generally expected that senescence will continue to be delayed in a warming climate, increasing the amount of carbon captured by these plants under climate change.However, researchers at ETH Zurich have now come to the opposite conclusion. In a study published in the journal ""Accurate forecasts of the growing season of trees have previously been difficult, as the drivers of leaf senescence have not been well understood,"" says Constantin Zohner, study leader and senior scientist at ETH Zurich's Crowther Lab.Until now, scientists have generally assumed that, after the summer ends, the autumnal declines in temperature and day length are the main cues determining the timing of leaf senescence. Some studies additionally indicated that leaf emergence in spring has an effect on leaf death in autumn. ""But because the importance of these mechanisms remained unclear, phenological models were at best only partly able to take such effects into account,"" says the biologist.Zohner suspected that the link between spring and autumn phenology can be explained by photosynthetic activity -- or more precisely, the phenomenon of carbon sink limitation. In this hypothesis, scarce soil nutrients such as nitrogen, among other things, limit the quantity of COThis role of photosynthesis in the control of leaf senescence has long been known for example in crops, but has never been tested in trees. This is what motivated ETH Zurich researchers to investigate the drivers of autumn phenology with a combined approach of field observations, laboratory tests and modelling.Long-term observations of six European deciduous tree species over the last six decades formed the basis of the study. Using this data, Zohner's team tested the relative influence of various factors on the timing of autumn senescence, including leaf emergence in spring, seasonal photosynthesis, COIn addition, the researchers also performed a set of experiments with saplings in climate chambers and outdoors. This enabled them to isolate the effects of temperature, daylight and COThe long-term observations revealed a strong effect of photosynthesis: in years with increased photosynthesis in spring and summer, leaf senescence began earlier, with each ten percent increase in photosynthetic activity advancing leaf senescence by eight days. The experiments supported these findings.""Our analyses suggest that seasonal photosynthesis, autumn temperatures and day length are the key drivers of senescence,"" says lead author Deborah Zani in explaining the forces involved. ""Several other factors, such as atmospheric COWarmer autumns under climate change therefore tend to postpone senescence. This effect, however, is counteracted by increasing photosynthesis in spring and summer through rising COZani and Zohner developed a new model of autumn phenology that takes all factors into account according to their relevant weight. This model enabled the researchers to predict the timing of autumn senescence over the last six decades with up to 42 percent more accuracy compared to previous models.The authors then used this model to generate updated forecasts of leaf senescence timing over the rest of the century and the results were quite unexpected. Until now it had been expected that senescence would occur two to three weeks later by the end of the century. ""Our new model suggests the contrary: if photosynthesis continues to increase, leaves will senesce three to six days earlier than they do today"" says Zani. ""This means that the growing season will be extended by only 8 to 12 days by the end of the century, around two to three times less than we previously thought,"" Zani adds. She conducted the data analysis and modelling as part of her Master's thesis at the Crowther Lab.In their study, the researchers made use of data from the Pan European Phenology Project, evaluating a total of 434,000 phenological observations at 3,800 locations in central Europe between 1948 and 2015.

They have identified a troubling trend: Too little vegetation is sprouting up from rainwater in developing nations, whereas things are headed in the opposite direction in wealthier ones. As a result, the future could see food shortages and growing numbers of climate refugees.","More than 40 percent of Earth's ecosystems are arid, an amount that is expected to increase significantly over the course of the 21st century. Some of these areas, such as those in Africa and Australia may be savannah or desert, where sparse rainfall has long been the norm. Within these biomes, vegetation and wildlife have adapted to making use of their scant water resources, but they are also extraordinarily vulnerable to climate change.Using extensive imagery from satellites that monitor Earth every day, researchers from the University of Copenhagen's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management have studied the evolution of vegetation in arid regions. Their conclusion is unequivocal:""We observe a clear trend of arid areas developing in a negative direction in the most economically challenged countries. Here, it is apparent that the growth of vegetation has become increasingly decoupled from the water resources available and that there is simply less vegetation in relation to the amount of rainfall. The opposite is the case in the wealthiest countries,"" explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.The researchers analyzed 15 years worth of satellite imagery of vegetation and rainfall -- from 2000 to 2015. To compare the evolution of vegetation in arid regions of the world, the researchers removed precipitation totals from the equation. In other words, they produced a calculation that accounts for the fact that some regions received more rain in past decades, while other regions received less.This provides a more accurate picture of ecosystem health, as human influences become easier to identify: In other words, whether resource use is balanced or whether an ecosystem's resources have been overexploited, with potentially fatal consequences -- as imbalanced systems may be irreparable.""Here, our results demonstrate that in arid regions, particularly those in Africa and Asia, less vegetation grows for the amount of rainwater that falls, while more vegetation grows in arid areas of South America and Australia,"" says lead author Christin Abel, a postdoc at the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.Infographic text: Areas with purple hues indicate where vegetation growth relative to rainfall is declining, while green hues reveal areas where vegetation has grown more than expected. White areas represent ecosystems where vegetation growth is in balance with the water resources available.According to the researchers, there may be several explanations for why climate change and rising global temperatures are impacting vegetation in arid regions of the world's poorest countries. Among the most obvious is rapid population growth, in Africa for example, where there is an increasing need to exploit land that is otherwise poorly suited for agriculture. Doing so produces lower yields and puts increasing amounts of livestock on too little grass in already fragile ecosystems.Conversely, vegetation in arid areas of the world's wealthier countries seems to be coping better with climate change. This is likely due to the intensification and expansion of larger farms, where more economic resources allow for, among other things, irrigation and fertilization.As a result of climate change, future trends for the planet's poorest areas only seem to be getting worse. Forecasts point to an expansion of today's arid areas where they will make up a larger and larger share of our global ecosystems. This may result in more and more people being left without food and their needing to migrate.""One consequence of declining vegetation in the world's poorer arid regions areas may be an increase in climate refugees from various African countries. According to what we've seen in this study, there is no indication that the problem will diminish in the future,"" explains Rasmus Fensholt.For a number of years, satellite imagery has let researchers observe that, overall, it actually appears that the world's arid regions have become greener. However, when researchers look at how much vegetation arid areas in developing countries get in relation to rainfall amounts, the picture looks different.""We have been pleased to see that, for a number of years, vegetation has been on an upwards trend in arid regions. But if we dig only a tiny bit deeper and look at how successfully precipitation has translated into vegetation, then climate change seems to be hitting unevenly, which is troubling,"" says Rasmus Fensholt.",Climate,2020.0,"More than 40% of Earth's ecosystems are arid, and this is expected to increase significantly over the course of the 21st century. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management have analyzed 15 years worth of satellite imagery of vegetation and rainfall in arid regions. They found that arid areas in Africa and Asia have less vegetation for the amount of rainwater that falls, while more vegetation grows in arid areas of South America and Australia. Climate change and rising global temperatures are impacting vegetation in arid regions of the world's poorest countries.",,

As the climate warmed, on the other hand, as it did through the period of deglaciation, the retreating ice in the Northern Hemisphere led to rising water levels around Antarctica, which in turn drove a retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet.""Ice sheets can influence each other over great distances due to the water that flows between them,"" explains senior author Natalya Gomez, from McGill's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. ""It's as though they were talking to one another through sea level changes.""""Polar ice sheets are not just large, static mounds of ice. They evolve on various different time scales and are in constant flux, with the ice growing and retreating depending on the climate and the surrounding water levels,"" explains Gomez. ""They gain ice as snow piles up on top of them, then spread outwards under their own weight, and stream out into the surrounding ocean where their edges break off into icebergs.""In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in driving changes in the Antarctic ice sheet over geologic time scales, the study draws on numerical modeling and a wide range of geological records, from cores of sediment from the ocean bottom near Antarctica to records of land exposure and past shorelines.With this information, the researchers were able, for the first time, to simulate, simultaneously, changes in both sea levels and ice dynamics in both hemispheres over the past 40,000 years. This time frame provides the basis for a broad understanding of how climate factors affect ice sheets, since it covers the period leading up to the peak of last Ice Age, between 26,000-20,000 years ago up to the present.The records suggest that there the ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over this period was significant, with intermittent periods of accelerated retreat. The researchers found that the only mechanism that could explain this response were the sea level changes in Antarctica caused by changes to the ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.""We found a very variable signal of ice-mass loss over the last 20,000 years, left behind by icebergs breaking off Antarctica and melting down in the surrounding oceans,"" says Michael Weber, from the Department of Geochemistry and Petrology at the University of Bonn. ""This evidence could hardly be reconciled with existing models until we accounted for how the ice sheets in both hemispheres interact with one another across the globe.""""The scale and complexity of ice sheets and the oceans, and the secrets of the Earth's past climate that are locked up in the geological record are fascinating and inspiring,"" concludes Gomez. ""Our results highlight how interconnected the Earth system is, with changes in one part of the planet driving changes in another. In the modern era, we haven't seen the kind of large ice sheet retreat that we might see in our future warming world. Looking to records and models of changes in Earth's history can inform us about this.""",Climate,2020.0,"A study from McGill University has suggested that changes to the ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere were responsible for significant ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the past 20,000 years. The research simulated changes in ice dynamics and sea levels in both hemispheres over the last 40,000 years. The study found that only changes to the ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere could explain the Antarctic loss, which was characterised by intermittent periods of accelerated retreat.

379,25-Nov-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201125091514.htm,"In fire-prone West, plants need their pollinators -- and vice versa","2020 is the worst fire year on record in the United States, with nearly 13 million acres burned, 14,000 structures destroyed and an estimated $3 billion spent on fire suppression -- and counting. At the same time, certain land managers have invested huge amounts of time and resources toward restoring fire through ""controlled burn"" approaches.","In the face of heartbreaking losses, effort and expense, scientists are still grappling with some of the most basic questions about how fire influences interactions between plants and animals in the natural world.A new study grounded in the northern Rockies explores the role of fire in the finely tuned dance between plants and their pollinators. Published Nov. 25 in the ""A large number of studies have looked at how fire affects plants, or how fire affects animals. But what is largely understudied is the question of how fire affects both, and about how linkages within those ecological networks might respond to fire disturbance,"" said Jonathan Myers, associate professor of biology in Arts & Sciences at Washington University, a co-author of the study.The researchers discovered that wildfire disturbance and plant-pollinator interactions are both important in determining where plants take root and where pollinators are found. But in burned landscapes, plant-pollinator interactions are generally as important or more important than any other factor in determining the composition of species present.The importance of flowering-plant species in determining the composition of pollinator species doubled to quadrupled following wildfire. In addition, the importance of pollinators in determining plant composition nearly doubled following wildfire.""Clearly, pollinators perform a valuable ecosystem service for humans by pollinating all our crops. In intact natural ecosystems, they perform an equally valuable service,"" said Joseph LaManna, assistant professor of biological sciences at Marquette University, first author of the study. ""What we are seeing is that plant and pollinator linkages become even more important in disturbed or burned landscapes. These connections are important for restoring ecosystems in which natural wildfire regimes have been altered or suppressed by human activities.""And as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, the potential for biodiversity loss -- for losses of individual plant or pollinator species -- is going to be even more profound than we anticipated,"" he said.Wildfire in the northern Rockies can be ignited by lightning -- but more and more, it is started by people.Historically, wildfires tended to burn hot in some spots and cold in others, resulting in a patchwork or mosaic of differing levels of fire disturbance. But with rising global temperatures, the plant debris and other materials that fuel fires are drying out. That trend combined with decades of active fire suppression has resulted in a shift from a majority mixed-severity wildfire regime to today's high-severity blazes.For this study, co-author Laura Burkle at Montana State University led the field inventories of plants and pollinators at 152 plots in Montana representing a wildfire gradient including plots with no recent wildfire (unburned), mixed-severity wildfire and high-severity wildfire. LaManna and Myers worked with Burkle and Travis Belote of The Wilderness Society to analyze the data.At the sites they compared, the scientists found that the number of individual bees, flies and butterflies -- and the flowering plants they frequent -- were higher in parts of the landscape that had burned, as opposed to those that hadn't burned.However, increases were greater in areas that had experienced mixed-severity wildfire, which leaves some vegetation intact in a mosaic of habitat types, as opposed to high-severity wildfire, which largely removes all vegetation and can damage the soil and seed bank.For example, flowering-plant abundances increased more than 10-fold in mixed-severity wildfire and more than nine-fold in high-severity wildfire compared with unburned areas. Overall the researchers identified 329 pollinator species and 193 flowering-plant species.""Oftentimes, the public perception about fire in general is that it is bad. But it was impressive how much higher the abundances of both plants and pollinators were -- as well as the number of species -- in the burned landscapes compared with the unburned landscapes,"" Myers said.Although this study shows that fire increased abundances and species diversity of pollinators and flowering plants overall, the intensity of the fire matters. Hotter, high-severity burns can eliminate landscape features that pollinators require, like stumps or woody debris for nesting. Mixed-severity wildfire is most beneficial.Around the world, pollinator populations are in decline. The northern Rockies are no exception to this troubling trend.""Thanks to this project, we now have very in-depth knowledge of local pollinator communities, especially the bee communities,"" Burkle said. ""One of the benefits of these data is to be able to provide expert knowledge about declining pollinator species and species of concern, like the Western Bumble Bee (""When we think about patterns of biodiversity across space, we typically consider different groups of species separately,"" she said. ""In our case, we might consider patterns of plant diversity separately from patterns of pollinator diversity. But our study provides solid evidence that -- above and beyond the influence of disturbances like wildfires -- the relationships that plants have with pollinators are strong contributors to these patterns of biodiversity.""This means that biotic interactions among species are important and will need to be considered more explicitly in conservation actions, like plans for species range shifts with climate change.""Global climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires in many other regions -- as it has in the mountain West, the researchers said.The findings from this study suggest that this could possibly result in additional losses of vulnerable species.""We may see wildfire accelerating co-extinction events where you lose a pollinator and then you lose all of the plants that the pollinator depended on -- and then you lose more pollinators that were associated with those plants, and so on,"" LaManna said. ""You have a potential for a chain of losses.""Overall, this research advances understanding of how and why wildfire affects conservation, land management and restoration of forest ecosystems. It also shows that ecological models that predict how species will respond under various climate change scenarios also should consider biological interactions within food webs, Myers said.""By sharing our findings with federal land managers across the region, we hope to contribute to management plans, with the dual aim of maintaining biodiversity of plants and pollinators while restoring environmental complexity representative of historical fire regimes,"" Myers said.",Climate,2020.0,"A study published in the journal Ecosphere has explored the role of fire in the relationship between plants and their pollinators.

Today, the species can be found in Israel mainly in deep habitats that exist at a depth of 100 meters (330 feet).","The researchers believe that the main reason for the disappearance of the sponges was the rise in seawater temperatures during the summer months, which in the past 60 years have risen by about 3°C (37°F).The study was led by Professor Micha Ilan and PhD student Tal Idan of TAU's School of Zoology at the George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences and Steinhardt Museum of Natural History. The article was published in the journal ""Sponges are marine animals of great importance to the ecosystem, and also to humans,"" Professor Idan explains. ""They feed by filtering particles or obtain substances dissolved in the seawater and making them available to other animals. Sponges are also used as a habitat for many other organisms and contain a wide variety of natural materials used as a basis for the development of medicines.""In our study, we focused on the Agelas oroides species, a common Mediterranean sponge that grew throughout the Mediterranean Sea from a depth of less than a meter to 150 meters deep. But the sponge has not been observed in Israel's shallow waters for over 50 years.""During the study, the researchers used a research vessel and an underwater robot belonging to the nongovernmental organization EcoOcean. With that help, they located particularly rich rocky habitats on the seabed at a depth of about 100 meters (330 feet), approximately 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of Israeli shores. The most dominant animals in these habitats are sponges, which is why the habitats are called ""sponge gardens.""The researchers collected 20 specimens of the Agelas oroides sponge, 14 of which were transferred to shallow waters at a depth of 10 meters (about 30 feet), at a site where the sponge was commonly found in the 1960s. The remaining six specimens were returned to the sponge gardens from which they were taken and used as a control group.The findings showed that when the water temperature ranged from 18°-26°C (64°-79°F), usually in the months of March to May, the sponges grew and flourished: they pumped and filtered water, the action by which they feed, and their volume increased. But as the water temperature continued to rise, the sponges' condition deteriorated. At a temperature of 28°C (82°F), most of them stopped pumping water, and during the month of July, when the water temperature exceeded 29°C (84°F), all of the sponges that had been transferred to the shallow water died within a short period of time.At the same time, the sponges in the control group continued to enjoy a relatively stable and low temperature between 17°-20°C (63°-68°F), which allowed them to continue to grow and thrive.The researchers believe that the decisive factor that led to the disappearance of the sponges from the shallow area was prolonged exposure to high seawater temperature. According to them, ""In the past, the temperature would also reach 28.5°C (83°F) in the summer, but only for a short period of about two weeks. So the sponges, even if damaged, managed to recover. Today, seawater temperatures rise above 29°C (84°F) degrees for three months, which likely causes multi-system damage in sponges and leaves them no chance of recovering and surviving.""""From 1960 until today, the water temperature on the Israeli Mediterranean coast has risen by 3°C (37°F), which may greatly affect marine organisms, including sponges,"" Professor Ilan concludes. ""Our great concern is that the changes taking place on our shores are a harbinger of what may take place in the future throughout the Mediterranean. Our findings suggest that continued climate change and the warming of seawater could fatally harm sponges and marine life in general.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study led by researchers from Tel Aviv University has found that sponges in the Mediterranean Sea are disappearing due to rising seawater temperatures.

An international team of researchers assessed how well this framework is working and what challenges it faces.","The scenario framework contains a set of scenarios about how society may evolve in the future -- so-called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) -- and defines different levels of climate change known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Combining both aspects of the framework allows researchers to develop integrated analyses of how future societies can avoid climate change and cope with its impacts.""The SSPs started with brief global narratives combined with projections of a few key variables like GDP, population, and urbanization. In the past few years, researchers extended the SSPs to individual countries, cities, and sectors. They've also added new indicators, such as governance, income distribution, access to basic services, and air pollution. The framework has been widely and successfully applied, and has shaped climate change research,"" explains Brian O'Neill, director of the Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) and main author of the assessment published in ""The scenarios framework allows scientists to use similar scenarios across many different studies. Individual research projects don't need to develop their own scenario storylines and quantifications but can build on the work of others. Once many studies use comparable scenarios, it becomes more straightforward to assess the literature for insights that emerge across these studies. This means that large scientific assessments like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) can use the framework to structure their analyses and reports,"" adds IIASA researcher Bas van Ruijven, one of the authors of the study and co-chair of the International Committee on New Integrated Climate Change Assessment Scenarios (ICONICS).In their paper, the authors synthesize the insights from the first ever Scenarios Forum organized by the University of Denver and ICONICS in Denver, CO in March 2019, and present the first in-depth literature analysis of the SSP-RCP scenarios framework. They specifically looked into how useful the framework has been for researchers, which topics the SSPs have been used for, and what can be done to improve the framework and make it more useful for future studies.The results show that the framework has been used in almost 1,400 studies over the past five years, of which about half are related to climate impacts, one-third to avoiding climate change, and the remainder to extensions or methodological improvements. Encouragingly, the findings indicate that the scenarios framework enables research that had not been possible before, such as estimating the combined impacts of socioeconomic and climate changes on exposure to climate risks. The insights from this new study will help researchers to improve the framework and make it even more useful over the next five years. The study also revealed that some studies use unlikely combinations of socioeconomic assumptions with the highest climate change outcomes (the so-called RCP8.5 pathway). They caution that researchers should be more careful using this high climate change scenario for their studies in combination with a development pathway aiming to sustainable development, as well as in communication about their findings.The authors identified seven recommendations for future work:""While the scenarios framework is mostly used by researchers, it has also been translated into accessible non-technical language for the public. It has had a significant impact on how we study and think about future climate change. By identifying the weaknesses of the existing framework, we improve the utility of the framework for future studies. Also, by combining socioeconomic and climate change scenarios with other societal objectives (e.g., biodiversity), we can paint a more concrete picture of what future societies might look like and systematically explore how to avoid climate change and how to cope with its impacts,"" notes IIASA Energy Program Director Keywan Riahi, who was also a study author.Going forward, ICONICS and IIASA will support the research community in further improving the scenarios framework. To facilitate these developments, the two organizations will organize an online seminar and discussion series starting in January 2021. To foster and track progress, and revise goals as experience accumulates, the Scenarios Forum is intended to become a regular biennial event.

With ongoing climate change, the timing of these cues, like the accumulation of warm days, is rapidly shifting. Now a network of researchers working on an unprecedentedly large dataset of seasonal events has shown that the timing of species' activity fail to keep up with their cues, and that how quickly activity shifts reflects past evolution.","The observed patterns of local adaptation translate to a massive imprint on nature's calendar, making geographic variation in the timing of natural events more pronounced in spring and less pronounced in autumn. Since organisms have evolved to respond differently in different areas, it will take further evolution to adjust to the new climate.In nature, species' activities are timed to their environment. For plants to bloom when their pollinators are around, for birds to breed when there is food for their chicks -- and then to leave before snow covers the ground -- they must follow cues in their environment.""One such cue relates to temperatures: in warm years, all types of events tend to occur early, and in cold years, they tend to occur late. How much events shift with shifts in temperature is described by something that we call a ""reaction norm"","" explains Professor Tomas Roslin, one of the lead authors of the study, who runs twin research teams at both the University of Helsinki and in Uppsala, at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.Since keeping track of the seasons is so important, it can be subject to selection in nature. As a result, species' reaction norms can be adapted to their local environment. With a given shift in the cue, individuals in one place may shift the timing of their activity more than in another. Now, what happens when the local environment changes -- as it is now doing across the world?To answer this question, researchers have compiled meticulously collected observations of hundreds of seasonal phenomena made over decades at several hundred sites throughout the former Soviet Union. This massive data set has opened an unprecedented opportunity to explore climate change responses over an enormous area and over an enormous time scale.""We looked at events ranging from the first song of the great tit through the appearance of the common toad and the appearance of the first porcini mushroom to the end of birch leaf fall,"" says Maria Delgado, the other lead author of the study, from the Oviedo University in Spain. ""What we saw was a general rigidity in species' response to year-to-year variation in climate, i.e. the earlier the year, the more did the timing of the phenological event lag behind the timing of the cue from temperatures.""""On top of this, we saw large differences between seasons and sites. Differences in the reaction norms of different sites accentuated phenological responses in the spring and dampened them in the autumn. As a result, among population variation in the timing of events is greater in the spring and less in the autumn than if all populations followed the same reaction norm. Overall, such patterns will affect species' response to climate change in opposite ways in spring and autumn.""The data forming the basis of the study is quite the story, since they build on a previously uncovered archive of nature's calendar. For many decades -- in some cases a full century -- scientists have been recording events in more than 150 protected areas across the former Soviet Union. These data were meticulously compiled as an annual report, one for each protected area. For the longest time, this unique scientific contribution then laid hidden in the archives.""But over the past decade, we have now been trying to mobilize these data. To this end, we have been working with an amazing group of more than 300 colleagues in over 80 organizations from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan,"" explains Evgeniy Meyke, who together with Otso Ovaskainen coordinated the data basing of the enormous material from the University of Helsinki.Now compiled, The Chronicles of Nature program provides an archive exceptional in almost every aspect: It is comprehensive in nature, and spans over all sorts of species and events, long time periods (almost a century), large areas (half of Asia), and it has been systematically collected by dedicated, full time scientific staff. Many to the participating scientists have spent their entire life in collecting these data, and at the time of publication, six were already deceased. The current paper is thus a homage to their work.""This has been a thrilling journey -- and it is only a beginning. We are excited by the enthusiasm of the environmental science professionals who initiated this collaboration. They gave the world an opportunity to connect with the results of their life long work, which had remained mostly unknown to the international scientific community,"" says Otso Ovaskainen, Professor of mathematical ecology at the University of Helsinki, and the primus motor behind the project. ""Sadly, in most of the participating countries, protected areas and their staff are currently facing tough challenges. We hope that our findings will summon the interest of the international community, and focus attention on the global importance of these areas and the irreplaceable scientific work done by their staff. Should these time series break, there is no way to re-forge them.""",Climate,2020.0,"Geographic variation in the timing of natural events, such as plants blooming and birds breeding, is becoming more pronounced in spring and less pronounced in autumn due to local adaptation.

383,23-Nov-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201123161043.htm,A rich source of nutrients under the Earth's ice sheets,"Trace elements such as iron, manganese and zinc are an integral part of the biogeochemical processes on the Earth's surface. As micronutrients, they play an essential role for the growth of all kinds of organisms and thus the Earth's carbon cycle. Below ice sheets, which cover around ten percent of the Earth's land surface, larger quantities of these substances are mobilised than previously assumed. This is shown by new data from Greenland and Antarctica, which were collected and analysed by an international research team led by Jon Hawkings from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam and Florida State University (USA). They provide important insights into previously unknown processes at the boundary of ice, meltwater and rock. Because the ice masses are significantly influenced by global warming, new perspectives are emerging on the consequences climate change has for critical biogeochemical processes, including those in surrounding ecosystems such as oceans, lakes and wetlands. The study is published today in the journal ","Under the Earth's ice sheets melt water forms an extensive hidden wetland of rivulets, rivers and lakes. During the last forty years, over 400 subglacial lakes have been discovered in Antarctica alone; some as large as the Great Lakes of North America. At the boundary between ice, water and rock, a complex ensemble of chemical, physical and microbiological forces is at work, breaking up and grinding rock and releasing trace elements into the meltwater which is carried downstream. These chemical elements occur only in very low concentrations, hence the name. Nevertheless they are -- like vitamins -- essential as nutrients for all living things.How and in which quantities trace elements are released under the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and eventually flow into the adjacent ecosystems, and what role they play in these ecosystems and the global carbon cycle at large, has not yet been studied in detail. This is because measurement campaigns in these remote regions of the world are an enormous logistical and technical challenge.In order to collect samples from the waters under the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and analyse them in the laboratory, Jon Hawkings from GFZ collaborated with an international and interdisciplinary research team. Colleagues Mark Skidmore and John Priscu from Montana State University (USA) led a project to drill more than 1000 metres into the Antarctic ice sheet as part of their SALSA project. This enabled them to tap into the nine-kilometre long and 15-metre deep Mercer Subglacial Lake. ""There's a science reason for looking at that specific lake, but then there is the context of these lakes being part of this greater hydrological system,"" Mark Skidmore said. ""So, we want to see what's being generated beneath the ice sheet and how that connects to the coastal environments.""Jon Hawkings himself and colleagues under the lead of Jemma Wadham of the University of Bristol (UK) took samples from sub-ice waters emerging from Leverett Glacier in Greenland over a three-month period in the summer melt season.The samples were analysed in ultra-clean laboratories to avoid contamination. The researchers filtered the meltwater samples to multiple levels to sort the sample concentrations by size, as many of these trace elements can exist as extremely small nanoparticulate minerals. They determined their chemical composition using particularly sensitive mass-spectrometry methods.Hawkings and his colleagues discovered that significant amounts of trace elements are released in the melt waters below the ice masses. They found these melt water concentrations can exceed those in rivers and the open ocean by many times. For example, the value for dissolved iron in the Antarctic subglacial lake was more than 1000 micrograms per litre and not around five, as would be expected in dilute ice melt.""For a long time it was assumed that in the icy regions of the earth trace elements are present in such miniscule quantities that they are of little importance for global elemental cycles. On the contrary, our results show that ice sheets may play a key role in regional mobilization of these elements. The impacts of this need to be further monitored and analysed in the context of climate change. We have now laid a baseline for this,"" says Jon Hawkings.Furthermore, the concentrations of the individual elements as well as their ratios and the size distribution between dissolved and nanoparticulate mineral forms tell the researchers something about the source material, the sub-ice sheet weathering processes and the paths taken by the water before sampling. For example, it is known that the element vanadium occurs primarily in silicate rock minerals rather than carbonate rock minerals. Elevated concentrations found in this study indicate that higher rates of silicate mineral weathering are occurring under ice sheets than previously thought. Importantly, silicate mineral weathering is a sink for carbon dioxide. Iron, on the other hand, is known to oxidise in an oxygen-rich environment, resulting in precipitated ""rust."" Large quantities of dissolved iron therefore indicate that some of the water may originate from a region with little oxygen. The researchers also found trace elements like aluminium, iron and titanium occurred in higher concentrations in Antarctica than in Greenland. They therefore hypothesise that the meltwater in the southern polar region has much longer residence times under the ice sheet and greater hydrological isolation than in the northern polar region.The new findings are particularly relevant for our understanding of nutrient cycling in the Southern Ocean. There the water is considered to be rich in nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus but depleted in iron. For this reason, phytoplankton, the plants of the ocean, the base of the global food pyramid and an important CO2 sink, do not grow to their maximum potential. This ""iron limitation"" has been the subject of previous geoengineering projects to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by seeding the ocean with iron. The results of Hawkings and his colleagues are consistent with observations of higher quantities of iron and phytoplankton in the immediate vicinity of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Their results suggest that the ice sheet may naturally fertilize the coastal regions of the Southern Ocean by providing a supply of iron for phytoplankton. To what degree and how this might change in the future with climatic warming remain open questions for further research.Hawkings and his collaborators investigated 17 different trace elements. ""Each of these tells us its own story and we work like detectives, trying to make a coherent overall narrative out of all the data,"" says the geoscientist. ""We are interested in exploring the limits of life on Earth in terms of the availability of energy and nutrients, and this helps tell us part of that story. We are only just beginning to understand the importance of these large ice masses in this context. Hopefully our research also helps in starting to answer many important outstanding scientific questions, which include the influence of climate change: How will these biogeochemical cycles change if more ice melts? Will this release more and more trace elements or will these processes be slowed down? In addition, it is still open what happens to the substances on their way into the oceans and how much ultimately reaches marine organisms.""Collaborator and SALSA project lead John Priscu points out the importance of interdisciplinary work for scientific discoveries: ""This paper intersects many disciplines and shows the power of international collaboration. Results in this manuscript have transformed our view of how polar ice sheets influence the Earth System.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have discovered that significant amounts of trace elements are released in the melt waters below the Earth's ice sheets, which can exceed those in rivers and the open ocean by many times.

The study showed that pathogens found at warm locations outperform their animal hosts during cool weather as warm-adapted animals perform poorly. Similarly, pathogens found at cool locations thrive at warm temperatures, while cold-adapted animals are less tolerant of the heat.Researchers also collected historical temperature and precipitation records at the time and location of each survey, and long-term climate data for each location to understand how temperature affected animal disease risk in different climates, and how these patterns varied depending on traits of animals and pathogens. The study also revealed that cold-blooded animals tended to offer stronger support for the thermal mismatch hypothesis than warm-blooded animals.Next, they coupled their models to global climate change projections to predict where the risk of animal infectious diseases might change the most. The analysis suggests that global warming will likely shift infectious disease away from the equator, with decreases of animal infectious diseases in the lowland tropics and increases in the highland tropics, temperate and cooler regions of the planet.""When each pathogen species was given equal weight, the predicted increases in infectious disease at cooler locations outweighed the decreases at warmer locations, potentially suggesting a net increase in animal infectious diseases with climate change,"" said Rohr, who is also an affiliated member of the Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative and the Eck Institute for Global Health.As for next steps, Rohr says the researchers aim to evaluate whether similar patterns exist for human and plant diseases, the latter of which could have implications for food security.Co-authors on the study are Erin Sauer of South Florida and Wisconsin-Madison, and Olivia Santiago and Samuel Spencer of South Florida.

Tracking data show that they're becoming increasingly common in the southeast, and less frequent in ""Tornado Alley,"" which stretches across the Great Plains. Scientists lack a clear understanding of how tornadoes form, but a more urgent challenge is to develop more accurate prediction and warning systems. It requires a fine balance: Without warnings, people can't shelter, but if they experience too many false alarms, they'll become inured.","One way to improve tornado prediction tools might be to listen better, according to mechanical engineer Brian Elbing at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, in the heart of Tornado Alley. He doesn't mean any sounds audible to human ears, though. As long ago as the 1960s, researchers reported evidence that tornadoes emit signature sounds at frequencies that fall outside the range of human hearing. People can hear down to about 20 Hertz -- which sounds like a low rumble -- but a tornado's song likely falls somewhere between 1 and 10 Hertz.Brandon White, a graduate student in Elbing's lab, discussed their recent analyses of the infrasound signature of tornadoes at the 73rd Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics.Elbing said these infrasound signatures had seemed like a promising avenue of research, at least until radar emerged as a frontrunner technology for warning systems. Acoustic-based approaches took a back seat for decades. ""Now we've made a lot of advances with radar systems and monitoring, but there are still limitations. Radar requires line of sight measurements."" But line of sight can be tricky in hilly places like the Southeast, where the majority of tornado deaths occur.Maybe it's time to revisit those acoustic approaches, said Elbing. In 2017, his research group recorded infrasound bursts from a supercell that produced a small tornado near Perkins, Oklahoma. When they analyzed the data, they found that the vibrations began before the tornado formed.Researchers still know little about the fluid dynamics of tornadoes. ""To date there have been eight trusted measurements of pressure inside a tornado, and no classical theory predicts them,"" said Elbing. He doesn't know how the sound is produced, either, but knowing the cause isn't required for an alarm system. The idea of an acoustics-based system is straightforward.""If I dropped a glass behind you and it shattered, you don't need to turn around to know what happened,"" said Elbing. ""That sound gives you a good sense of your immediate environment."" Infrasound vibrations can travel over long distances quickly, and through different media. ""We could detect tornadoes from 100 miles away.""Members of Elbing's research group also described a sensor array for detecting tornadoes via acoustics and presented findings from studies on how infrasound vibrations travel through the atmosphere. The work on infrasound tornado signatures was supported by a grant from NOAA.Other sessions during the Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting similarly addressed ways to study and predict extreme events. During a session on nonlinear dynamics, MIT engineer Qiqi Wang revisited the butterfly effect, a well-known phenomena in fluid dynamics that asks whether a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could trigger a tornado in Texas.What's unclear is whether the butterfly wings can lead to changes in the longtime statistics of the climate. By investigating the question computationally in small chaotic systems, he found that small perturbations can, indeed, effect long-term changes, a finding that suggests even small efforts can lead to lasting changes in the climate of a system.During the same session, mechanical engineer Antoine Blanchard, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, introduced a smart sampling algorithm designed to help quantify and predict extreme events -- like extreme storms or cyclones, for example. Extreme events occur with low probability, he said, and therefore require large amounts of data, which can be expensive to generate, computationally or experimentally. Blanchard, whose background is in fluid dynamics, wanted to find a way to identify outliers more economically. ""We're trying to identify those dangerous states using as few simulations as possible.""The algorithm he designed is a kind of black box: Any dynamical state can be fed as an input, and the algorithm will return a measure of the dangerousness of that state.""We're trying to find the doors to danger. If you open that particular door, will the system remain quiescent, or will it go crazy?"" asked Blanchard. ""What are the states and conditions -- like weather conditions, for example -- that if you were to evolve them over time could cause a cyclone or storm?""Blanchard said he's still refining the algorithm but hopes to start applying it to real data and large-scale experiments soon. He also said it may have implications beyond the weather, in any system that produces extreme events. ""It's a very general algorithm.""",Climate,2020.0,"Mechanical engineer Brian Elbing at Oklahoma State University suggests that listening to the infrasound signature of tornadoes could improve prediction tools.

Water temperatures in the reservoir now have the potential to increase significantly due to climate change. If average global warming reaches between 4 and 6 degrees by the year 2100, as the current trend suggests, temperature conditions in the Rappbode Reservoir will become comparable to those in Lake Garda and other lakes south of the Alps. In an article in ","The impacts of climate change can already be seen in the Rappbode Reservoir: Over the past 40 years, the water surface temperature in the reservoir has increased by around 4 degrees in the summer months. This trend could continue, as has now been demonstrated by a team of researchers led by Dr Karsten Rinke, who researches lakes at UFZ. Working on the basis of a lake model developed by US researchers, the team took into account potential reservoir management strategies to forecast the impacts climate change could have on water temperatures and on the lake's physical structure, which control the stratification and seasonal mixing of the body of water. Their research looked at three scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions. The so-called ""representative concentration pathways"" (RCPs) describe whether greenhouse gas emissions will be halted (RCP 2.6), will continue to rise (RCP 6.0) or even continue to increase unabated (RCP 8.5) by 2100. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, the latter case would result in average global warming of more than 4 degrees by the end of this century.For the RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios, the study's authors projected that the average temperature on the water surface of the Rappbode Reservoir is set to increase by 0.09 degrees or 0.32 degrees respectively every decade by the year 2100. This would correspond to a total increase of around 0.7 degrees (RCP 2.6) and around 2.6 degrees (RCP 6.0) by the end of this century. As expected, the increase in temperatures would be the highest under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which would see the water temperature increasing by 0.5 degrees every decade or approx. 4 degrees by 2100.However, in terms of using drinking water, what happens in the deeper strata of the reservoir -- i.e., at depths of 50 metres and below -- is more serious, as this is where raw water is taken out before being treated to prepare it as drinking water. It is true that impacts by 2100 would be relatively minor under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios, as the water temperature would continue to be around 5 degrees year-round. However, water temperatures will increase significantly under the RCP 8.5 scenario -- by nearly 3 degrees by the end of the century. As a result, the water in the depths of the reservoir would warm to around 8 degrees. ""This would turn a reservoir in Germany's northernmost highlands into a body of water comparable to Lake Maggiore or Lake Garda nowadays,"" says UFZ scientist Rinke. An increase of this magnitude would have consequences because it would significantly accelerate the speed of biological metabolic processes. ""A temperature increase to 8 degrees nearly doubles oxygen demand, that is the amount of oxygen organisms consume during their respiration and degradation processes,"" says lead author Chenxi Mi, who is focusing on climate impacts on the Rappbode Reservoir in his doctorate at UFZ. Increased oxygen consumption will place an additional pressure on the water's oxygen budget, because the duration of summer stagnation -- the phase of stable temperature stratification in lakes in which the deep water is closed off to oxygen supply from the atmosphere -- is already extending due to climate change. Plus, warmer water is also unable to absorb as much oxygen. Potential consequences include intensified dissolution of nutrients and dissolved metals from the sediment, algae growth and an increase in blue-green algae.In other words, the 8.5 scenario would have impacts on the drinking water supply if it were to occur. The reservoir's operators draw the raw water from the lowermost strata for good reason, as the water there is cold and contains only low levels of suspended substances, dissolved metals, algae, bacteria and potentially pathogenic microorganisms. If the oxygen content there decreases more rapidly due to the rising water temperature, the risk of contamination increases, for example due to substances released from the sediment and greater bacteria growth. Treating the water would therefore require a greater effort on the part of the operators, and they would have to deal with higher demands in terms of the treatment capacity they would need to reserve. ""This means preventing the deep water from warming is also worthwhile from the perspective of the drinking water supply, and the ideal way to do this is ambitious climate policies that limit warming,"" says Rinke.But the operators are not completely powerless against the warming of the deep water in the reservoir. The model simulations set up by Rinke's team show that a share of the heat can be exported by using a clever system to withdraw the water. This has to do with the water that is released to the downstream waters that is, the water that is withdrawn and drains into the water course below the reservoir in order to keep the discharge conditions there stable. This so-called downstream discharge would need to be withdrawn not from the lower strata as it has been thus far but rather from near the surface. ""This approach would allow the additional heat caused by climate change to be released again,"" Rinke explains. However, he adds, it would be impossible to prevent the deep water from heating up if the air temperature increases beyond 6 degrees. ""Even though operators have had to cope more with a shortage of water due to the very dry years we've had recently, it's just as important to think about the quality of the water. In terms of reservoir management, we definitely have options and can respond to new conditions caused by climate change. In this way, we can alleviate certain negative impacts through climate adaptation measures.""The operators of the Rappbode Reservoir at the Talsperrenbetrieb Sachsen-Anhalt company are aware of this. They have been working closely together with Karsten Rinke and his team of researchers at UFZ for many years to assess the impacts of climate change and discussed about potential options for adapting the Rappbode Reservoir. The Talsperrenbetrieb is already planning new infrastructures that will make it possible to implement the new management strategies.",Climate,2020.0,"The Rappbode Reservoir in Germany has seen a water surface temperature increase of around 4 degrees in the summer months over the past 40 years due to climate change, and this trend is expected to continue, according to researchers led by Dr Karsten Rinke.

It does not dictate what levels of each should be present during an experiment into the causes of coral bleaching; rather, it offers a common framework for increasing comparability of reported variables.""Our goal was to create a structure that would allow researchers to anchor their studies, so we would have a common language and common reference points for comparing among studies,"" said Grottoli, who also is director of the consortium that developed the common framework.Coral bleaching is a significant problem for the world's ocean ecosystems: When coral becomes bleached, it loses the algae that live inside it, turning it white. Coral can survive a bleaching but being bleached puts coral at higher risk for disease and death. And that can be catastrophic: Coral protects coastlines from erosion, offers a boost to tourism in coastal regions, and is an essential habitat to more than 25% of the world's marine species.Bleaching events have been happening with greater frequency and in greater numbers as the world's atmosphere -- and oceans -- have warmed because of climate change.""Reefs are in crisis,"" Grottoli said. ""And as scientists, we have a responsibility to do our jobs as quickly, cost-effectively, professionally and as well as we can. The proposed common framework is one mechanism for enhancing that.""The consortium leading this effort is the Coral Bleaching Research Coordination Network, an international group of coral researchers. Twenty-seven scientists from the network, representing 21 institutions around the world, worked together as part of a workshop at Ohio State in May 2019 to develop the common framework.The goal, Grottoli said, is to allow scientists to compare their work, make the most of the coral samples they collect, and find ways to create a common framework for coral experimentation.Their recommendations include guidelines for experiments that help scientists understand what happens when coral is exposed to changes in light or temperature over a short period of time, a moderate period, and long periods. The guidelines include a compendium of the most common methods used for recording and reporting physical and biological parameters in a coral bleaching experiment.That such a framework hasn't already been established is not surprising: The scientific field that seeks to understand the causes of and solutions for coral bleaching is relatively young. The first reported bleaching occurred in 1971 in Hawaii; the first wide-spread bleaching event was reported in Panama and was connected with the 1982-83 El Niño.But experiments to understand coral bleaching didn't really start in earnest until the 1990s -- and a companion paper by many of the same authors found that two-thirds of the scientific papers about coral bleaching have been published in the last 10 years.Researchers are still trying to understand why some coral species seem to be more vulnerable to bleaching than others, Grottoli said, and setting up experiments with consistency will help the science move forward more quickly and economically.""Adopting a common framework for experiments around coral bleaching would make us more efficient as a discipline,"" Grottoli said.""We'd be able to better collaborate, and to build on one another's work more easily. It would help us progress in our understanding of coral bleaching -- and because of climate change and the vulnerability of the coral, we need to progress more quickly.""Other Ohio State researchers who are co-authors on the paper are graduate students Rowan McLachlan, James T.

A mathematics graduate student at the University of Sydney in Australia, Hester and researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts are studying how the shape of an iceberg shapes the way it melts.","""Ice deforms as it melts,"" said physical oceanographer Claudia Cenedese, who has worked with Hester on the project. ""It makes these very weird shapes, especially on the bottom, like the way the wind shapes a mountain on a longer time scale.""At the 73rd Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics, Hester presented results from his group's experiments aimed at understanding how melting alters the face-changing boundary of a shrinking iceberg -- and how those alterations in turn affect the melting.The dynamics of iceberg melt is missing from most climate models, Cendese said. Including them could help with prediction: icebergs pump fresh water from ice sheets into oceans, boosting communities of living organisms. Icebergs are the dominant source of freshwater in the fjords of Greenland -- and a significant contributor to freshwater loss in Antarctica. Icebergs play a critical role in the climate, Cenedese said, and shouldn't be neglected in models. The physics of melting ice is well understood, and some models simulate it accurately, she said. Others don't. ""But what you can't do in those simulations is change the shape of the ice.""Icebergs form with a wide range of shapes and sizes, Hester said, and distinct thermodynamic processes affect different surfaces. The base, submerged in water, doesn't melt in the same way as the side. ""And each face doesn't melt uniformly,"" added Cenedese.Hester conducted his experiments by submerging a dyed block of ice in a flume with a controlled flow of water passing by, and watching it melt. He and his colleagues found that the side facing a current melts faster than sides that run parallel to flow. By combining experimental and numerical approaches, Hester and his collaborators charted the relative influences of factors like relative water velocity and aspect ratio, or the proportion of height to width on a side. Not surprisingly, they found that the bottom had the slowest melt rate.Cenedese said Hester's project brings together collaborators from a range of disciplines and countries, and that a diverse collaboration was needed for such an interdisciplinary project. ""Working in isolation isn't as productive in this case.""Other studies discussed at the conference focused on ice formation, rather than melting. During a session on particle-laden flows, engineer Jiarong Hong from the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, discussed results from experiments showing how turbulence influences both the speed and distribution of snow as it falls and settles. The findings could also help scientists better understand precipitation, Hong said.Another project, presented by physicist Chao Sun from Tsinghua University in China and his group during a session on convection and buoyancy-driven flows, focused on ice formation in lakes.Working on a grant from the Natural Science Foundation of China with Ziqi Wang from Tsinghua University, Enrico Calzavarini from the University of Lille in France, and Federico Toschi from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, Sun showed how the formation of ice on a lake is closely tied to the fluid dynamics of the water beneath.A lake may possess layers of water of differing densities and temperatures. ""The water density anomalies can induce elaborate fluid dynamics beneath a moving ice front and can drastically change system behaviors,"" said Sun. ""This has often been ignored in previous studies.""Sun's group combined physical experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical models to investigate the connection between the ice and (turbulent) convective flows. They identified four distinct regimes of different flow dynamics, each of which interacts with other layers and the ice in its own ways. Even with that complexity, though, the group developed an accurate theoretical model that could be used in future studies.""It made a fair prediction of ice layer thickness and of icing time,"" said Sun.Since the formation and melting of ice plays such a critical role in the climate, he said, a better understanding of the fluid dynamics behind the process could help researchers identify and study accurately the markers of a warming world.

For instance, the episodic warming of the tropical Pacific during El Niño events causes melt of sea ice in far-reaching parts of the Southern Ocean via its effect on the global atmospheric circulation. A new study, published this week in the journal ","Using a hierarchy of climate model simulations, the authors demonstrate the physical pathways via which polar climate variations can affect the trade winds in the tropics.""Climate signals can propagate from the polar regions to the tropics either via the atmosphere or the ocean,"" explained Malte Stuecker, co-author and assistant professor in the Department of Oceanography and International Pacific Research Center at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ""Our climate model simulations were designed to investigate the relative role of these pathways and whether their importance differs for perturbations originating from the North pole or the South pole.""The authors found that in the most complex model simulations, which include realistic representations of the ocean, atmosphere, land, and sea ice, an anomalous cooling in either hemisphere leads to a strengthening of the tropical trade winds.Lead author Sarah Kang from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea explained the reasoning behind these experiments: ""One of the largest sources of uncertainty in the current generation of climate models are biases in the representation of clouds over the cold Southern Ocean. We wanted to explore what effect too much reflection of solar radiation by these clouds to outer space might have on global climate. In addition, large emissions of aerosols in the late 20th century due to industrial activity in the Northern Hemisphere from North America, Europe, and Asia resulted in a slight, temporary reduction of the global warming rate that is due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.""According to the authors' results, both of these effects could potentially explain why the Pacific trade winds were anomalously strong in recent decades.""If the communication between the poles and the tropics would only occur via the atmosphere, we would see quite a distinct response in the tropics depending on whether an anomalous cooling arises from the Arctic or the Antarctic,"" Stuecker added. ""This is because the Intertropical Convergence Zone -- the largest rainband on Earth -- is located to the north of the equator. It effectively blocks a communication from the Arctic to the equator via the atmosphere.""Contrasting experiments with and without a realistic ocean representation, the authors show that enhanced upwelling of cold subsurface water in the eastern tropical Pacific is able to communicate the Arctic cooling towards the tropics and thereby strengthening the trade winds.An important implication of the results is that reducing uncertainty in simulated extratropical climate may also lead to improved simulation of climate in the tropics. The model hierarchy developed by the authors can be used to further explore two-way interactions between the tropics and polar regions both for future climate projections as well as for interpreting reconstructions of climate states in the geological past.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have used climate model simulations to demonstrate how polar climate variations can affect trade winds in the tropics.

A new study headed by Uppsala University now shows that only 6-11 per cent of the areas where three rare cat species have their habitat are protected. Lack of knowledge about these species has been an obstacle to understanding their needs for reserves. The research is presented in the journal,"Over a third of the world's cat species inhabit the Indian subcontinent. In the new study, the researchers have explored the situation of the Prionailurus genus. It includes the rusty-spotted cat (P. rubiginosus), found in this region alone, which seems to thrive best in broadleaved forests; the fishing cat (P. viverrinus), a species associated primarily with wetlands, mangrove swamps and coastal areas; and the leopard cat (P. bengalensis), which has been observed mainly in tropical and subtropical forest areas.""This study is important because it shows that many small, rare and elusive cats in the Indian subcontinent don't get as much attention as the more spectacular big cats. Nevertheless, the need to protect them is just as pressing, so the number and size of the protected areas must be increased to include more biotopes containing these species,"" says Mats Björklund, Professor Emeritus of Zooecology at Uppsala University.Using the geographic coordinates of sites where the various species have been seen over the years, and more recent information collected from camera-trap surveys, the scientists were able to develop ecological niche models. These could then be used to identify zones with environmental conditions that, to a high degree, suit these species individually. These models also enabled the researchers to gain a better understanding of ecological factors, such as climate, land cover and land use, that restrict or favour the occurrence of a species -- information of the utmost importance for future conservation measures.The scientists were also able to see that the most severe threats vary for the species included in the study. The leopard cat, for example, is most threatened by a warmer climate since parts of its range, such as the mountainous areas in the Western and Eastern Ghats, are clearly beginning to develop higher temperatures than this species can withstand. The rusty-spotted cat, on the other hand, is limited mainly by human cultivation of the land, especially in areas of intensive irrigation. This is of particular concern because the proportion of farmland in the region is rising. The fishing cat seems to be the Prionailurus species that, to date, has had the smallest proportion of its habitat protected.Small, shy and rare cats have the greatest need for protection. The results of this study show that, although the species studied are closely interrelated, they respond differently to environmental change. Accordingly, to cover their main biotopes, future protection must cover larger areas and more habitats accessible to these species.""Some of these species, like the fishing cat, are extremely rare and probably need protection for long-term survival. The fact that only a very small proportion of the most suitable habitat for this species is protected is a warning sign that the protected-area network in the Indian subcontinent needs to be reviewed. Species like the rusty-spotted cat exist only in this region, so to ensure we don't lose them it's essential to create more protected areas,"" says André P. Silva, a doctoral student at the Department of Ecology and Genetics at Uppsala University and the study's lead author.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has found that many small and rare cat species in the Indian subcontinent are not receiving enough attention and require increased protection.

This coordination of plant-microbes plays an important part in controlling mineral nutrient content in the plant. The study has been published online by the journal Gabriel Castrillo of the Future Food Beacon and lead author on the research said: ""In mammals the specialized diffusion barriers in the gut are known to coordinate with the resident microbiota to control nutrient flow. Although similar regulatory mechanisms of nutrient diffusion exist in plant roots, the contribution of the microbes to their function was unknown until now.This study has, for the first time, shown the coordination between the root diffusion barriers and the microbes colonising the root. They combine to control mineral nutrient uptake in the plant, which is crucial for proper growth and reproduction. Understanding this could lead to the development of plants more adapted to extreme abiotic conditions, with an enhanced capacity for carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. Alternatively, plants with a high content of essential mineral nutrients and the capability to exclude toxic elements could be developed.""All living organisms have evolved structures to maintain a stable mineral nutrient state. In plant roots and animal guts these structures comprise specialized cell layers that function as gate-keepers to control the transfer of water and vital nutrients.To perform this function, it is crucial that cells forming these layers are sealed together. These seals need to maintain integrity in the presence of local microbial communities. In animals, microbes inhabiting the gut are known to influence the intestinal sealing and, in some cases, this can cause diseases.In roots, two main sealing mechanisms have been found: Casparian Strips, which seal cells together, and suberin deposits that influence transport across the cell plasma membrane. This research shows how these sealing mechanisms in multicellular organisms incorporate microbial function to regulate mineral nutrient balance.Food security represents a pressing global issue. Crop production must double by 2050 to keep pace with global population growth. This target is even more challenging given the impact of climate change on water availability and the drive to reduce fertilizer inputs to make agriculture become more environmentally sustainable. In both cases, developing crops with improved water and nutrient uptake efficiency would provide a solution and this. This discovery could lead to the development of new microbial approaches to control nutrient and water diffusion, presenting new opportunities to design more resilient crops, new feeding strategies and possible ways to harness carbon dioxide through carbon sequestration.",Climate,2020.0,"Scientists from the University of Nottingham's Future Food Beacon have discovered that the mechanism controlling root sealing in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant, affects the composition of microbial communities in the roots.

According to the National Weather Service, in 2020 the Phoenix area has surpassed all previous years for average high temperatures and excessive heat warnings.","With the combined oppressive heat and COVID-19 restrictions on travel and indoor activities like movies and restaurants, many people have turned to urban parks for outdoor recreation.And while Phoenix area parks can serve as an oasis for residents, the irrigation needed to keep parks lush and cooler comes at a high cost of water consumption.To determine this cost, a team of scientists led by hydrologist Enrique R. Vivoni of Arizona State University's (ASU) School of Earth and Space Exploration and School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment spent a year collecting data on weather conditions, evapotranspiration and soil water at Encanto Golf Course in Phoenix. The results of their study have been recently published in Vivoni and his team identified that the park showed what meteorologists call the ""oasis effect,"" which refers to the creation of a microclimate that is cooler than a surrounding dry area due to the evaporation of a water source.""The word 'oasis' may conjure up the image of a pool of water surrounded by palm trees in a sandy desert,"" says Vivoni. ""But this same effect occurs in urban parks when heat from the surrounding neighborhood is transported by winds into the park, increasing the evaporation rates.""To measure the oasis effect at Encanto Golf Course, Vivoni and his team used special sensors at a weather station located within the park. These sensors measured water and energy fluxes along with carbon dioxide exchanges depicting plant photosynthesis and respiration.Vivoni and graduate students Mercedes Kindler, Zhaocheng Wang, and Eli Pérez-Ruiz worked together on the sensor deployment, data analysis and use of satellite-based products to monitor the park conditions.""We set up at Encanto Park in February 2019 and all of our instruments were operational by the next month,"" says Kindler. ""For a year, we conducted weekly or bi-weekly visits to the sites for data collection and station maintenance. It has been a great experience working on this research project, since it has allowed us to learn more about water and energy fluxes at an urban golf course.""Their notable findings were two-fold. First, the oasis effect led to unexpectedly high evaporative losses during the night. Second, the oasis effect was related to the evaporation of soil water and irrigation water, and not to the activity of plants and grasses in the park.""Because of the oasis effect, when we irrigate our urban parks at night, we lose vast amounts of water and we see increased carbon dioxide emissions, which could lead to higher global warming potential,"" says Vivoni. ""This has important implications for water conservation and greenhouse gas emission management in desert cities such as Phoenix.""While additional studies are needed to determine when during the day it would be preferable to irrigate, making this management change would decrease evaporative loss and the carbon dioxide emissions (which contribute to global warming) during hot, dry, windy days.It also remains to be determined how widespread this effect is within Phoenix.

But urban life comes with a big trade-off -- health hazards linked to poorer water quality.","Researchers found that city-dwelling birds bred more nestlings because of warmer local temperatures. But they also had much higher levels of mercury in their blood -- presumably from eating insects that spent their larval stages in contaminated water -- than their counterparts breeding in less urban areas.The study was conducted in central Ohio, where scientists observed tree swallows as a model species to assess their breeding success, diet and health measures in the context of varied temperatures, water quality and land use based on the location of their nests.Despite those specifics, Ohio State University researchers consider the long-term study a harbinger of what's to come for all sorts of wildlife as urbanization increases while the climate continues to warm, and how land-use changes are likely to harm water quality and threaten biodiversity.Urban land accounts for about 70 million acres in the contiguous United States, representing a 470% increase since 1945.""With urbanization expanding worldwide, we are transforming the landscape. And this isn't going away,"" said lead author Ma?eika Sullivan, director of the Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Research Park at Ohio State. ""My lab is looking at how urbanization affects multiple responses of ecosystems -- what those changes are and quantifying them, but also seeing what this tells us about how we can manage and conserve ecosystems and wildlife in this context.""Our task, knowing wildlife are using urban settings, is to think about ways to maximize benefits and minimize the risks. There's nature in cities. So how can we make our cities a little more wild?""Sullivan, also an associate professor in Ohio State's School of Environment and Natural Resources, completed the work with graduate students Joseph Corra and Jeffry Hayes. The study was published online Nov. 15 in the journal Tree swallows are part of a guild of birds called aerial insectivores, which do all their dining on insects while in flight. Other species of swallows, as well as whip-poor-wills, nighthawks, swifts, martins and flycatchers, are also part of this group, and many of these species rely on ecosystems near water for food and habitat. Previous research has suggested that the number of North American birds has declined by about 3 billion since 1970, and the populations of some species of aerial insectivores have declined by over 50%.The magnitude of that loss alone is a striking example of biodiversity loss, Sullivan said. But the reduction in this guild of birds can also affect the economy and the quality of human life.""These migratory birds are really important not just in and of themselves, but because they're controlling insects -- including pest insects that carry disease or damage agricultural crops. So they are very, very important in terms of how ecosystems function and stay in balance,"" he said.For research purposes, tree swallows are also useful subjects because they are ""cavity nesters"" that flocked to the assortment of artificial nest boxes the team constructed along waterways in Columbus, some in developed zones and others in more forested areas.From 2014-2018, the researchers observed tree swallows during their breeding season, most of May and June each year, also measuring their body weight and blood glucose and mercury levels and tracking how much of the birds' food source came from insects emerging from water or starting their pre-winged life on land. The scientists also monitored temperature and chemical water quality and quantified percentages of forested or wetland versus developed land at the breeding sites.Egg-laying occurred significantly earlier (by almost eight days), the clutch sizes were larger, and the number of fledglings that left the nest was higher at the urban sites than at protected sites. This reproductive success was largely attributable to the temperature: The air was warmer in urban sites than in protected sites by an average of 3 degrees Fahrenheit, and city locations had fewer extremely cold days.""We were looking at urbanization in two different ways -- as a category of urban versus not urban, but also as gradients of urbanization. As the amount of urbanization increased, fledgling success increased,"" Sullivan said. ""This tells us local climate is extremely important for reproductive success of tree swallows, and likely other insectivorous birds.""But that success came with potential health risks related to poorer water quality in urban areas. Insects that emerge from water constituted roughly a third of the tree swallows' diet, and those insects also tend to provide more nutrition and energy than terrestrial flying insects. But the river water in urban areas had higher levels of mercury -- likely a proxy for other contaminants -- and the adult birds' blood concentration of mercury was 482% higher in city-dwellers than in those who bred in protected sites.""This is an important warning,"" Sullivan said. ""There's a whole suite of environmental contaminants out there -- pesticides, a lot of other heavy metals. So despite the advantage for breeding in these urban areas, there can be a trade-off in individual health.""These findings, and the implications for birds and other wildlife affected by growing urbanization, suggest that productive urban habitats should be factored in to future municipality planning, he said.Some top considerations for insectivorous birds, as Sullivan sees it, would be establishing protected green ways, creating nesting habitats and structures to replace lost trees and other parts of the natural landscape, lowering the chances for contaminants to stream into waterways, and protecting wildlife food sources by reducing the use of pesticides and insecticides.""If we had found that urbanization was negatively affecting tree swallows in all the different measures we used, that would be a very different story,"" Sullivan said. ""But I see some rays of hope here.""This work was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the Ohio Water Development Authority and Ohio State.",Climate,2020.0,"City-dwelling birds are breeding more nestlings due to warmer temperatures, but they are also experiencing higher levels of mercury in their blood due to contaminated water, according to a study by Ohio State University.

Hawaiian Pizza and ice-cream -- another part of our world is stuffed, throwing away food every day. This gap is likely to worsen, while food waste will increase and pressure on the environment will go up, a new study shows. Researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) assessed the consequences if the current nutrition transition, from scarce starch-based diets towards processed foods and animal products, continues -- the calculations combine, for the first time, estimates for under- and overweight, food composition and waste. Their findings provide a startling look ahead: By 2050, more than 4 billion people could be overweight, 1.5 billion of them obese, while 500 million people continue to be underweight.","""If the observed nutrition transition continues, we will not achieve the United Nations goal of eradicating hunger worldwide,"" explains Benjamin Bodirsky from PIK, lead author of the study just published in Scientific Reports. ""At the same time, our future will be characterized by overweight and obesity of mind-blowing magnitude."" By 2050, 45 percent of the world's population could be overweight and 16 percent obese -- compared to about 29 and 9 percent in 2010. This development is due to the insufficient global distribution of food as well as to the shift from scarcely processed plant-based diets towards unbalanced, affluent diets, where animal protein, sugar and fat displace whole grains and pulses.And that's not all as Bodirsky underlines: ""The increasing waste of food and the rising consumption of animal protein mean that the environmental impact of our agricultural system will spiral out of control. Whether greenhouse gases, nitrogen pollution or deforestation: we are pushing the limits of our planet -- and exceed them.""Crop and grazing land for food production cover about one third of the global land area; our food system is responsible for up to a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. The study projects that -- if current trends continue -- global food demand will increase by about 50% between 2010 and 2050, the demand for animal products like meat and milk will approximately double, a development that requires more and more land.""Using the same area of land, we could produce much more plant-based food for humans than animal-based food,"" explains co-author Alexander Popp, head of PIK's Land Use Management Research Group. ""To put it in a very simplistic way: If more people eat more meat, there's less plant-based food for the others -- plus we need more land for food production which can lead to forests being cut down.

The study could provide valuable orientation about the potential development pathway of different countries and regions. It could also support much-needed pro-active policies for a qualitative transition towards sustainable and healthy diets.Sabine Gabrysch concludes: ""We urgently need political measures to create an environment that promotes healthy eating habits. This could include binding regulations that limit the marketing of unhealthy snacks and promote sustainable and healthy meals in schools, hospitals and canteens.

The key to this model's success was calculations that estimate fluctuations in the whales' prey: zooplankton.Using prey-centric species distribution models is beneficial for understanding where the whales are now and where they will be in the future. As climate change continues to warm waters and melt sea ice, impacting where the whales' food source will likely be, this research could guide protection efforts as well as shipping routes and fishing guidelines.The study focused on the western Arctic bowhead whales in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska, but Pendleton has hopes to use the prey-centric model to track the movements of North Atlantic right whales, a critically endangered species of 356 individuals that migrates along the east coast of the U.S. and Canada. Right whales are threatened by climate change, collisions with ships, and entanglements with fishing lines.""Warm water that's been coming into the Gulf of Maine has affected the supply of their primary prey,"" said Pendleton, adding that the shift has pushed some right whales to migrate further north into Canadian waters to feed in late summer.

Further, they show It's not just the farmlands that shoulder environmental impacts. Effects are felt faraway as massive water redirects gobble energy and spew emissions. And the biggest reveal: Sometimes, it's places that have no major stake in the plant-water-eat game that end up paying an environmental price.""Ensuring food security while safeguarding the environment is one of the greatest challenges for the world today, yet as the world has become so globalized, it is an incredibly complicated process, and misunderstanding it or missing impacts can allow major setbacks in achieving sustainability,"" said Jianguo ""Jack"" Liu, MSU Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability. ""We need to deploy the new ways of looking at the world in a way that embraces its complexity.""So, the scientists used the framework of metacoupling, which helps look not only at the irrigated farmlands, but also the massive projects to move water from one region to another. The metacoupling framework allows scientists from many different disciplines look at the interactions between socioeconomics and environmental forces -- like climate change, diet change, irrigation technologies, crop planting strategies, water diversion -- both within and across borders.They used the North China Plain (NCP), which is a major food production region, and the rest of China, which has seen significant spikes in food demand, as a demonstration, as well as one segment of China's massive South-to-North Water Transfer Project. While China was the study site, the authors note these methods for examining sustainability would be applicable in the United States and across the world.Meeting soaring food demands, the crops -- primarily wheat and maize -- require massive amounts of water. The world's largest and longest water transfer project in this study draws from Hubei Province's water reserves in southern China. The people in Hubei aren't farmers on the scale in the NCP, nor do they buy a significant portion of their cereal crops from the NCP. They are what the scientists call a ""spillover"" -- meaning they are not direct players in this providing/consuming food network. Yet Hubei lost significant amounts of land and water to the project dedicated to keeping the NCP wet and growing. The water transfer also generated a substantial energy footprint.The team of scientists took the food supply issue from the simplicity of solving a problem of producing food by transferring water, to a more complex one that recognized the many causes and effects that fan out far beyond the farms and tables.""This study demonstrates the importance of understanding our increasingly connected world in a way that quantifies the often missed and unrecognized connections involved in feeding the world,"" said Elizabeth Blood, program director of the National Science Foundation's Ecosystem Science and Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems, which supported the work.""The world is very focused on solving critical environmental problems,"" said Zhenci Xu, an MSU research associate and the paper's first author. ""We are declaring that we cannot cherry-pick the problem we want to solve because growing crops is about more than irrigation and more about the plot of cropland. You cannot have water at this scale without using energy and changing how land is used. Which then means CO2 emissions are generated, and climate change is exacerbated. We say this is complicated, but it's also an opportunity to help make real change.""The paper calls for policies to help address multiple aspects of environmental impacts in different areas simultaneously affected by the transfer of water. They also note that instead of focusing only on the supply side of the issue -- in this case the farmlands -- it can be useful to also include consumption-based policies -- such as encouraging shifts in diets that depend less on resource-intensive crops.""We need to get used to looking at the many sides of every issue and be prepared likewise to come forward with many different solutions,"" Liu said.

In addition to supplying water to over 25 million people in California and Nevada, meadows contain large quantities of carbon belowground. While it has been known for some time that meadows have large quantities of soil carbon, whether meadow soils are gaining or losing carbon has remained unclear.","A new study led by researchers in the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology & Natural Resources at the University of Nevada, Reno, has demonstrated for the first time that meadows throughout the region are both gaining and losing carbon at high rates. Capture and storage of carbon in soil is a natural way to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and combat climate change. However, human activities can disrupt natural processes and lead to the loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere. These results suggest that meadow management may either contribute to climate change or mitigate the harmful effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.The research was conducted in partnership with the University of California Merced, as well as numerous restoration practitioners and conservation organizations in more than a dozen meadows throughout the Sierra Nevada mountains. The study is aimed at arming restoration practitioners with information to help make good management decisions.""Meadows are known for their lush, diverse vegetation supported by soils that stay wet into the summer,"" explained University of Nevada, Reno, doctoral candidate Cody Reed, who led the study. ""However, a long history of human activity in many meadows throughout the Sierra Nevada has resulted in drier soils and the replacement of wetland vegetation with sparse grasses and shrubs.""In research published this week in the scientific journal In the long-term, such changes to the large soil carbon stocks in meadows could add up. And unlike in forests, where most carbon is sequestered in wood aboveground, the change in carbon in meadows is belowground. This means meadow soil carbon is less vulnerable to disturbances such as wildfire and may persist in the ecosystem for longer than aboveground carbon. At the same time, soil carbon provides other important benefits besides taking carbon out of the atmosphere.""Worldwide, soils may contain up to four times as much carbon as the atmosphere,"" Reed explained. ""Soil carbon in meadows also helps improve water quality and quantity, as well as soil fertility to support diverse plant communities important for wildlife and grazing.""The research will likely help meadow restoration practitioners identify meadows in need of conservation to maintain soil carbon gains and meadows in need of restoration to prevent additional losses of soil carbon to the atmosphere. The researchers estimate that three acres of surrounding forest are required to offset the amount of carbon lost by one acre of degraded meadow. On the other hand, one acre of meadow may sequester as much carbon as six acres of forest.""Our research shows meadows may be some of the best bang for the buck in terms of carbon management in the region,"" Sullivan said.

As economies ""build back better,"" it may be an opportune time to introduce carbon pricing to tackle climate change, according to new Princeton University policy research.","While endorsed by many economists, carbon pricing has been slower to gain traction because of its potential to shock economies and the difficulty of securing political support for increasing taxes. However, fuel prices are already low and people are buying fewer goods and traveling less, so there could be greater benefits to introducing or strengthening carbon prices, the authors argue in the journal Carbon pricing -- whether in the form of taxes or emissions trading -- is an economic approach to account for the environmental costs of emitting greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. Carbon taxes typically apply to the producer with increased costs ultimately trickling down to any activity using carbon. For example, oil-extraction companies would be taxed, adding costs to any process that involved burning oil. Emissions-trading schemes set some cap on emissions and permits to emit are traded, but the number of total permits available correspond to that cap.""When we think about long-term problems like the pandemic or climate change, it's easy to assume that the solutions could conflict since they all require massive resources,"" said lead author Kian Mintz-Woo, a former postdoctoral research associate in Princeton's University Center for Human Values and the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA). ""But what we describe in this article is how the context of the coronavirus crisis actually provides a unique opportunity for mutually reinforcing forward-thinking solutions to improve sustainability and wellbeing as countries recover.""Mintz-Woo, who recently joined the Philosophy and Environmental Research Institute at University College Cork, Ireland, added that this research expands on an op-ed co-authored with Princeton Professor Peter Singer published on May 7 by Project Syndicate.With markets already reorienting to adjust to supply-and-demand shocks brought on by the pandemic, introducing carbon pricing now would result in marginally less disruption and could actually help drive greener economic activity. Placing a price on carbon could prompt industries to move away from more costly fossil-fuel intensive practices and toward long-term economic and environmental sustainability.""Since carbon pollution already increases health and environmental costs borne by society, forcing those generating the costs to pay for them would lead to fairer production and consumption,"" Mintz-Woo said.In the context of low fuel prices over an extended period, as seen in recent months, the researchers suggest that a carbon tax could help stabilize prices and ensure that renewable energy sources -- the prices of which were becoming cost-competitive even before the Covid-19 crisis -- can remain competitive. The researchers say that as economies move toward recovery, a carbon price can drive individuals and firms to adopt less carbon-intensive processes, rather than locking-in unsustainable energy practices that will ultimately require more drastic future corrections.""Preventing commitment to future emissions is the key,"" Mintz-Woo said. ""But that cannot come at the expense of those who may be at risk for job losses in this transition. Governments should use the revenue to both reduce any regressive effects of the taxation and retrain those who come from industries that could be adversely affected.""The researchers acknowledge that governments are under pressure to prioritize economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, so any policy changes with the potential to dampen a stimulus effect could be unpopular. However, they argue that high prices are not the primary obstacle to consumer purchasing; the cause of the economic slowdown has more to do with restricted market activity during the pandemic.Revenue generated from a carbon price could contribute toward government spending on social safety nets, fund other green priorities to drive innovation and new jobs, or be returned as credits to taxpayers. In all cases, the potential revenue source could be a welcome infusion during the Covid-19 crisis, when regional and national governments face massive fiscal shortfalls which can be expected to grow in the coming months.""Right now, governments are considering bailouts for carbon-intensive sectors, like the airline industry,"" Mintz-Woo said. ""While it's really hard on employees in that industry right now, government money would be far better spent on clean research and development investments and other strategies to help companies prepare for the future. And that means preparing for employment transitions away from carbon-intensive jobs and towards areas that will be more beneficial to the environment.

Inventory data from natural forests on five continents show that species diversity is optimal for equatorial and tropical rainforests, and that, conversely, in forests located in cold or dry regions, it is the abundance of trees and not their diversity that favours the recapture of CO","In recent decades, researchers have suggested that species diversity allows for denser stacking and niche compartmentalisation that promotes the abundance of trees within a forest and that this abundance increases the forest's carbon storage capacity. But another hypothesis suggests that it is not diversity that allows tree abundance but the availability of energy substrate. Areas with higher energy content allows more trees to thrive per unit area and thus increase carbon recapture. While these two hypotheses question the scientific community on the relationship between diversity and abundance, knowing the answer could pragmatically guide the fight against CO""Having more species may not always be what is needed to achieve greater carbon storage in forests,"" states Dr. Madrigal-Gonzalez. Instead, this relation only seems to prevail in the most productive forest regions of the planet that are basically restricted to equatorial and tropical rain forests, and some temperate forests -- in regions where deforestation and human-induced forest fires have ravaged pristine environments lately. On the contrary, in the forests located in the coldest or driest regions on Earth, it is seemingly the abundance, promoted by productivity, that determines the diversity. Here, any increase in the number of species will not necessarily result in more trees and will not therefore have a big contribution to carbon storage. The findings of these studies are of substantial practical relevance as they will aid decision makers identifying nature-based climate change mitigation strategies and to successfully use forests and their sequestration of carbon to reach the climate goals defined in the Paris Agreement. ""Increasing climatic stress in the most productive forests of the planet could diminish or even collapse the role of diversity against climate change"" says Prof. Markus Stoffel, Professor at the Institute for Environmental Sciences of the UNIGE.",Climate,2020.0,"Two hypotheses have been proposed on the relationship between species diversity and tree abundance in forests and their carbon storage capacity.

Many scientists think tropical animals, because they're accustomed to a more stable thermal environment, may be pushed beyond their limits quickly as temperatures soar. And that could lead to massive species loss.","Yet, in a first-of-its-kind study, University of Illinois researchers show both temperate and tropical birds can handle acute heat stress much better than expected.""In terms of their thermal physiology, a lot of these birds, including tropical species, can tolerate temperatures that are a lot higher than what they experience in their daily lives. That was surprising because tropical ectotherms, such as insects, have been shown to be extremely vulnerable to climate warming,"" says Henry Pollock, postdoctoral researcher at Illinois and first author on the study. ""We're just not seeing the same things in birds. It is somewhat encouraging.""Although they observed some promising trends, the researchers caution against celebrating too soon.""It's not necessarily comforting news. If someone walked away from this thinking tropical birds are going to do fine because they're not going to overheat, that would be a simplistic bottom line to take away from this paper,"" says Jeff Brawn, professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at Illinois and co-author on the study. ""Warming is likely to affect tropical birds indirectly, by impacting their resources, the structure of tropical forests. So they may not be flying around panting, suffering from heat exhaustion, but there may be more indirect effects.""To test the assumption that tropical and temperate birds differ in their ability to cope with heat stress, Pollock brought 81 species from Panama and South Carolina into field labs to test their responses to rising temperatures. Using tiny sensors, he was able to detect internal body temperatures, as well as metabolic rates, when he exposed the birds to warmer and warmer environments.Species from both temperate and tropical zones handled the rising temperatures just fine. Birds from South Carolina had a higher heat tolerance, on average, than Panamanian birds, but both groups exceeded Pollock and Brawn's expectations. And among all the birds, doves and pigeons emerged as thermal superstars. Most birds cool down by panting, but doves and pigeons take advantage of their unique-among-birds ability to ""sweat."" In fact, Pollock says, they exceeded the limits of his testing equipment.Although the study provided the first-ever heat tolerance data for many bird species, the results take on more meaning when put into the context of warming projections.""Both temperate and tropical birds were able to tolerate temperatures into the 40s [in degrees Celsius], but they only experience maximum temperatures of around 30 degrees Celsius in their everyday environments, so they have a substantial buffer,"" Pollock says.In other words, even if maximum air temperatures rise 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, as projected by some scientists, that's well within the thermal safety margins of all the birds Pollock measured.It's important to note the experiment, which measured acute heat stress, doesn't exactly replicate what's projected to happen during much more gradual climate warming. But few studies have examined the effects of chronic heat stress in birds, and having this baseline knowledge of their acute physiological limits is a good start.""This is the first geographic comparison ever for birds. We need more data from more sites and studies of chronic heat stress over longer periods of time. But I think at the very least, what we can say is that they're able to tolerate higher temperatures than I think anybody expected,"" Pollock says.Brawn adds, ""We're just starting to scratch the surface of what we need to do to really understand how climate change is going to affect birds.

In ","The ""Green Deal"" adopted by the European Commission is to change European agriculture significantly in the next years and to contribute to making Europe the first climate-neutral continent.

In addition, the EU plans to plant 3 billion trees, to restore 25,000 km of rivers, and to reverse the decrease in populations of pollinators, such as bees or wasps. ""These measures are important and reasonable,"" says Richard Fuchs from the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research -- Atmospheric Environmental Research (IMK-IFU), KIT's Campus Alpine in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. ""But it will be also necessary to specify foreign trade goals. Otherwise, we will only outsource the problem and continue to damage our planet."" The research team compared sustainability conditions abroad with those in Europe and recommended actions for a standardized procedure.According to the study, the European Union annually imports millions of tons of agricultural products. In 2019, one fifth of crops were imported from abroad, as were many meat and dairy products. However, the imports come from countries, whose environmental legislations are far less stringent than those in Europe. For instance, genetically modified organisms have been subject to strong limitations in EU agriculture since 1999. Still, Europe imports genetically modified soy beans and corn from Brazil, Argentina, the USA, and Canada, the study reveals. ""On the average, Europe's trading partners use more than twice as much fertilizers than we. Use of pesticides has also increased in most of these countries,"" Fuchs says. In his opinion, the problem is that each nation defines sustainability in a different way. Things forbidden in Europe might be permitted elsewhere. ""By importing goods from these countries, the EU just outsources environmental damage to other regions and earns the laurels for its green policy at home,"" the climate researcher points out.The scientists of KIT recommend to urgently harmonize sustainability standards, to strongly reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides and avoid deforestation. ""The EU cannot impose its standards in other countries, but it can demand that goods entering the European market meet EU requirements,"" Richard Fuchs says.The researcher points out that Europe's COMoreover, the scientists promote reduction of consumption of meat and dairy products. This would reduce the import of agricultural products. Domestic production in accordance with adequate standards should be strengthened. For this purpose, areas with a low diversity of species or not used for agriculture so far could be converted. This would reduce deforestation in the tropics, which is mainly caused by the creation of new framing areas. Harvest yields might be increased by the CRISPR gene editing technology, the team says. This technology improves the edible mass, height, and pest resistance of plants without using genes of another species.""Not all measures are easy to implement. Reorientation of agricultural production, however, would contribute to protecting Europe's food crops against global market fluctuations, disturbances of the supply chain, and some impactsd of climate change,"" Fuchs says. ""Only then will the ""Green Deal"" be a good deal not only for a climate-neutral Europe, but also for our entire planet.""",Climate,2020.0,"The European Commission's ""Green Deal"" aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2030, with significant changes to European agriculture. By 2030, a quarter of all agricultural areas will be farmed organically, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides will be reduced by 20% and 50%, respectively. The EU also plans to plant 3 billion trees, restore 25,000 km of rivers, and reverse the decline in pollinator populations. However, the EU imports millions of tons of agricultural products annually from countries with less stringent environmental legislation than Europe.

They demonstrate the extent to which rising temperatures are threatening coral reefs and other vital ecosystems that support biodiversity. In 2016 and 2017, an abrupt rise in surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean caused mass bleaching on an unprecedented scale. Australia's Great Barrier Reef was especially hard-hit.","Bleaching occurs when heat stress disrupts the symbiotic relationship between corals and the tiny algae that live inside them, providing a source of nutrients for coral and giving them their color. Persistent bleaching can lead to coral death. In the past two decades, abnormal heatwaves caused entire sections of reef off the coast of Australia -- measuring several kilometers in length -- to turn white.Scientists have already found that some reefs are better equipped to cope with recurring heat stress than others. For his thesis research, Oliver Selmoni, a doctoral assistant at EPFL's Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), applied the principles of environmental genomics to characterize this ability to adapt. Selmoni cross-referenced the results of genetic analyses of coral samples with ocean temperature data captured by satellites to determine what made some corals better able to withstand rising temperatures.Having applied his method to pre-existing data on a coral species in Japan, Selmoni travelled to New Caledonia to build a new study from the ground up. He collected his own coral samples with the help of the IRD scientists based in Nouméa. The findings were published in Nature The study aimed to test two hypotheses. The first is that coral populations learn to adapt to warmer seas after experiencing prolonged heat stress over many years. ""The longer higher temperatures persist, the more likely it is that climate-resilient traits will develop and be passed down from generation to generation,"" explains Selmoni. The second hypothesis relates to connectivity: corals reproduce by releasing larvae into the water, which are then carried in ocean currents. ""Corals rely on nearby populations for survival. When a reef is destroyed by environmental stressors or human activity, larvae from elsewhere are needed to kick-start repopulation,"" he adds.Selmoni's first task was to assess the composition of the marine environment in New Caledonia, using satellite data stretching back 30 years. After selecting 20 sites with the greatest temperature contrasts, he headed into the field to collect samples. ""We focused on three flagship Pacific coral species that are susceptible to bleaching and relatively easy to find,"" he recalls. ""It was a huge undertaking: 3,000 km by road and another 1,000 km by boat!"" Selmoni shared details of his experience on the EPFL Out There blog.Using environmental genomics methods at LASIG, he found that the field observations supported his connectivity and adaptation hypotheses. ""As expected, we observed a correlation between likelihood of adaptation and prolonged exposure to high heat stress. Conversely, corals in locations that had never experienced heat stress showed no climate-adaptive traits,"" explains Selmoni.Looking ahead, the maps developed in the study could be used to establish new marine protected areas (MPAs) -- zones where fishing, tourism, industry and other human activities are restricted -- in places where, through connectivity, heat-resistant coral strains could populate reefs around the archipelago. Another option could be to select and grow climate-adaptive corals, then transplant them into nearby reefs that are less able to withstand rising temperatures, thereby accelerating the process of natural selection. ""Over time, these hardier strains can help rebuild damaged reefs or make existing coral populations more resilient to bleaching,"" adds Selmoni.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study published in Nature has found that some coral populations are better able to withstand heat stress caused by climate change than others, and that this ability to adapt is passed down through generations.

Updating ice sheet models with this open valley could provide additional insight for future climate change predictions.","Radar surveys have previously mapped Greenland's bedrock buried beneath two to three thousand meters of ice. Mathematical models were used to fill in the gaps in survey data and infer bedrock depths. The surveys revealed the long valley, but suggested it was segmented, preventing water from flowing freely through it. However, the peaks breaking the valley into segments only show up in areas where the mathematical modelling was used to fill in missing data, so could not be real.Christopher Chambers and Ralf Greve, scientists at Hokkaido University's Institute of Low Temperature Science, wanted to explore what might happen if the valley is open and melting increases at an area deep in Greenland's interior known for melting. Collaborating with researchers at the University of Oslo, they ran numerous simulations to compare water dynamics in northern Greenland with and without valley segmentation.The results, recently published in The ""The results are consistent with a long subglacial river,"" Chambers says, ""but considerable uncertainty remains. For example, we don't know how much water, if any, is available to flow along the valley, and if it does indeed exit at Petermann Fjord or is refrozen, or escapes the valley, along the way.""If water is flowing, the model suggests it could traverse the whole length of the valley because the valley is relatively flat, similar to a riverbed. This suggests no parts of the ice sheet form a physical blockade. The simulations also suggested that there was more water flow towards the fjord with a level valley base set at 500 meters below sea level than when set at 100 meters below. In addition, when melting is increased only in the deep interior at a known region of basal melting, the simulated discharge is increased down the entire length of the valley only when the valley is unblocked. This suggests that a quite finely tuned relationship between the valley form and overlying ice can allow a very long down-valley water pathway to develop.""Additional radar surveys are needed to confirm the simulations are accurate,"" says Greve, who has been developing the model used in the study, called Simulation Code for Polythermal Ice Sheets (SICOPOLIS). ""This could introduce a fundamentally different hydrological system for the Greenland ice sheet. The correct simulation of such a long subglacial hydrological system could be important for accurate future ice sheet simulations under a changing climate.""",Climate,2020.0,"Scientists at Hokkaido University's Institute of Low Temperature Science have used mathematical models to explore the possibility of a long subglacial river flowing beneath Greenland's ice sheet.

For example, the researchers collected sediments and small bottom-dwelling animals to help document harmful algal blooms that are becoming more common as Arctic waters warm. The blooms pose a threat to the humans and marine mammals that eat them.Because of pandemic-related delays, the cruise began on Oct. 2 -- a much later start than originally planned. Historically, the Bering and Chukchi sea ecosystem transitioned to lower-level activity as sea ice formed in October.This year, unseasonably warm ocean temperatures delayed sea ice formation by several weeks. The lack of ice likely allowed the greater biological activity observed by the researchers.""The recovered data are already showing the effects of oceanic heat that extends further into the fall and early winter,"" said Seth Danielson of UAF's College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences.The scientists collected data for several marine science programs monitoring the Pacific Arctic ecosystem.The Distributed Biological Observatory, led by Jacqueline Grebmeier of UMCES, has been sampling productive hot spots since the late 1980s in U.S. Arctic waters.The Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observing Network, led by Katrin Iken at UAF's College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, is part of a national network studying how biodiversity and species distributions are changing as a result of climate change in the U.S. Arctic.The researchers also visited the Chukchi Ecosystem Observatory, a set of highly instrumented oceanographic moorings that monitor the ecosystem year-round.

""Through a telescope, a galaxy is a little misty spot. Then, all of a sudden, a star appears and may be as bright as the rest of the galaxy.""A very nearby supernova could be capable of wiping human civilization off the face of the Earth. But even from farther away, these explosions may still take a toll, Brakenridge said, bathing our planet in dangerous radiation and damaging its protective ozone layer.To study those possible impacts, Brakenridge searched through the planet's tree ring records for the fingerprints of these distant, cosmic explosions. His findings suggest that relatively close supernovas could theoretically have triggered at least four disruptions to Earth's climate over the last 40,000 years.The results are far from conclusive, but they offer tantalizing hints that, when it comes to the stability of life on Earth, what happens in space doesn't always stay in space.""These are extreme events, and their potential effects seem to match tree ring records,"" Brakenridge said.His research hinges on the case of a curious atom. Brakenridge explained that carbon-14, also known as radiocarbon, is a carbon isotope that occurs only in tiny amounts on Earth. It's not from around here, either. Radiocarbon is formed when cosmic rays from space bombard our planet's atmosphere on an almost constant basis.""There's generally a steady amount year after year,"" Brakenridge said. ""Trees pick up carbon dioxide and some of that carbon will be radiocarbon.""Sometimes, however, the amount of radiocarbon that trees pick up isn't steady. Scientists have discovered a handful of cases in which the concentration of this isotope inside tree rings spikes -- suddenly and for no apparent earthly reason. Many scientists have hypothesized that these several-year-long spikes could be due to solar flares or huge ejections of energy from the surface of the sun.Brakenridge and a handful of other researchers have had their eye on events much farther from home.""We're seeing terrestrial events that are begging for an explanation,"" Brakenridge said. ""There are really only two possibilities: A solar flare or a supernova. I think the supernova hypothesis has been dismissed too quickly.""He noted that scientists have recorded supernovas in other galaxies that have produced a stupendous amount of gamma radiation -- the same kind of radiation that can trigger the formation of radiocarbon atoms on Earth. While these isotopes aren't dangerous on their own, a spike in their levels could indicate that energy from a distant supernova has traveled hundreds to thousands of light-years to our planet.To test the hypothesis, Brakenridge turned to the past. He assembled a list of supernovas that occurred relatively close to Earth over the last 40,000 years. Scientists can study these events by observing the nebulas they left behind. He then compared the estimated ages of those galactic fireworks to the tree ring record on the ground.He found that of the eight closest supernovas studied, all seemed to be associated with unexplained spikes in the radiocarbon record on Earth. He considers four of these to be especially promising candidates. Take the case of a former star in the Vela constellation. This celestial body, which once sat about 815 lightyears from Earth, went supernova roughly 13,000 years ago. Not long after that, radiocarbon levels jumped up by nearly 3% on Earth -- a staggering increase.The findings aren't anywhere close to a smoking gun, or star, in this case. Scientists still have trouble dating past supernovas, making the timing of the Vela explosion uncertain with a possible error of as much as 1,500 years. It's also not clear what the impacts of such a disruption might have been for plants and animals on Earth at the time. But Brakenridge believes that the question is worth a lot more research.""What keeps me going is when I look at the terrestrial record and I say, 'My God, the predicted and modeled effects do appear to be there.'""He hopes that humanity won't have to see those effects for itself anytime soon. Some astronomers think they've picked up signs that Betelgeuse, a red giant star in the constellation Orion, might be on the verge of collapsing and going supernova. And it's only 642.5 light-years from Earth, much closer than Vela.""We can hope that's not what's about to happen because Betelgeuse is really close,"" he said.",Climate,2020.0,"A nearby supernova could wipe out human civilization, and even from farther away, these explosions may still damage Earth's protective ozone layer and bathe the planet in dangerous radiation.

This year, a late-season research cruise in October revealed a surprise. At a time of year when an ice-breaking ship is usually required to get them to some of the data-gathering outposts, scientists found nothing but open water and an unusually active ecosystem.","""The water and air temperatures were warmer, and we had ecosystem activity that normally doesn't occur late in the season,"" said University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Research Professor Jacqueline Grebmeier, chief scientist on the research cruise and a national and international leader in Arctic research.Grebmeier and Cooper were part of a small team of researchers from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Clark University that completed an unusual late-season Arctic research cruise due travel challenges presented by COVID-19 pandemic. They found an ecosystem -- expected to be powering down to low-level winter activity with sea ice forming -- to be still active, likely due to unseasonably warm ocean temperatures. Sea ice formation was still a number of weeks away.""2020 turned out to be the second lowest minimum sea ice extent, meaning that sea ice retreated back closer to the North Pole,"" Grebmeier said. ""We had warming water up to 3 degrees Celsius higher than typical all the way through water column. That means you can't cool it down that quickly to build ice.""And ice is important. It's the ice that sets up that really productive spring system to power the ecosystem.""Without ice forming you don't get that spring ice algal production, which is the first hit of nice, fresh carbon that the animals in the sediments use to increase their growth,"" she said. ""So some open water areas are going to bloom later in the season because it will be like opening a larger playing field and provide food for water column animals like zooplankton, while others that depended on that ice algal production in the bottom shallow shelf sediments are going to have more limited seasonal food.""The late fall season sampling indicates that delays in sea ice formation are supporting late-season biological production that has not been commonly observed before.""The biomass of microalgae in the water column was unexpectedly high and not much lower than often observed in the middle of the summer under near 24-hour daylight,"" said University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Research Professor Lee Cooper, who led water column biological and chemical measurements.Grebmeier and Cooper are also seeing shifts in these benthic animals. The clams and worms that live on the bottom of the Arctic and are an important food source for everything from bottom-feeding fish to walruses and diving sea ducks.""We are seeing declines in the biomass in a lot of areas so there isn't as much food on the sea floor as there used to be, meaning less food available for the things that we traditionally think of as Arctic animals,"" said Cooper. ""The ecosystem is changing.""""It's kind of like you took a balloon and you squeezed it, and the southern part of it is getting smaller and the northern part is getting bigger.

The individual participating universities had their own stringent requirements and testing protocols prior to approving travel.The team stopped at several established observing stations where scientists can monitor everything from the temperature and salinity of the water and the amount of zooplankton (fish food) swimming around to harmful algal blooms of phytoplankton and animals living in the sediment. The goal is to observe and document how the Arctic creatures are responding to climate change and track those ecosystem changes under further loss of sea ice.The Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) is a series of standard stations occupied seasonally by national and international ships and moorings that take continuous physical, chemical and biological measurements in the U.S. Arctic waters to document how biological systems are changing and/or adapting as a result of environmental change.

Are these seed banks gold mines or seed cemeteries?,"Researchers around the globe are investigating whether retained samples contain genes that have been lost through breeding which could be beneficial in counteracting climate change. A research team led by Chris-Carolin Schön, Professor of Plant Breeding at the TUM, is now presenting a solution to harness the genetic potential of old varieties, so-called landraces.Since the 1960s, maize has been grown in Europe's fields mainly in the form of hybrid varieties. Hybrid varieties are developed through a specific breeding scheme and, for example are ""trimmed"" for high yield per hectare or low susceptibility to pests. In order to breed the best variety, a kit of characteristics is needed that could be relevant both today and in the future. Thus, genetic diversity is the basic prerequisite for breeding improved crop plants.Hybrid varieties, however, carry only a small selection of traits compared to old varieties, the landraces. The question then is whether in addition to undesirable traits, beneficial traits have been lost in the course of many breeding generations. Therefore, the call for landraces has recently been revived, as they are characterized by high biodiversity and are considered a natural source of new genetic variation for breeding. Genetic variation reflects different variants of a gene and can be recognized by differences in the plant's appearance.The early development of young plants is of particular importance in times of climate change. Drought and heat are the conditions most damaging to crops, such as maize, when they occur during flowering. When a plant can be cultivated early in the year because it can cope with cold, it has already left its flowering period behind when temperatures are particularly high in summer. This means that it is less damaged and yield losses can be avoided.Professor Schön and her colleagues have been examining landrace varieties for cold tolerance characteristics. For this purpose, they have developed a genome-based method of identifying and making targeted use of beneficial gene resources. After a preliminary study, in which the researchers identified the genetic differences of individual varieties, the researchers selected three landraces for cultivation in different locations with varying climatic conditions within Europe.The research team focused on traits related to early plant development and also took into account the stability of the plant (How well does it withstand wind?) and the growth form (straight or bushy?). Using molecular methods that scan the entire genome, they were able to link the data from the field trials to genes relevant to the specific traits.""We have shown how to find new genetic variation for important traits in agricultural production. The variation in these traits is determined by many genes and is not sufficiently available in current breeding material,"" says Manfred Mayer, lead author of the study.

Their research looked at two discrete eruption events: one that was previously unknown to researchers, and the other that resulted in large swaths of terrestrial and marine life going extinct.","There have been five mass extinctions since the divergent evolution of early animals 450 -- 600 million years ago. The third was the largest one and is thought to have been triggered by the eruption of the Siberian Traps -- a large region of volcanic rock known as a large igneous province. But the correlation between the eruption and mass extinction has not yet been clarified.Sedimentary mercury enrichments, proxies for massive volcanic events, have been detected in dozens of sedimentary rocks from the end of the Permian. These rocks have been found deposited inland, in shallow seas and central oceans, but uncertainty remains as to their interpretation. Mercury can be sourced from either direct atmospheric deposition from volcanic emissions and riverine inputs from terrestrial organic matter oxidation when land/plant devastation -- referred to as terrestrial ecological disturbance -- occurs.The largest mass extinction occurred at the end of the Permian -- roughly 252 million years ago. This mass extinction was marked by the transition from the divergence of the Paleozoic reptiles and marine animals like brachiopods and trilobites to Mesozoic dinosaurs and marine animals such as mollusks. Approximately 90% of species disappeared at the end of the Permian.Current professor emeritus at Tohoku University, Kunio Kaiho led a team that looked into possible triggers of the largest mass extinction. They took sedimentary rock samples from two places -- southern China and Italy -- and analyzed the organic molecules and mercury (Hg) in them. They found two discrete coronene-Hg enrichments coinciding with the first terrestrial ecological disturbance and the following mass extinction in both areas.""We believe this to be the product of large volcanic eruptions because the coronene anomaly was formed by abnormally high temperature combustion,"" says professor Kaiho. ""High temperature magma or asteroid/comet impacts can make such a coronene enrichment.From the volcanic aspect, this could have occurred because of the higher temperature combustion of living and fossil organic matter from lava flows and horizontally intruded magma (sill) into the sedimentary coal and oil. The different magnitude of the two coronene-mercury enrichments shows that the terrestrial ecosystem was disrupted by smaller global environmental changes than the marine ecosystem. The duration between the two volcanic events is tens of thousands of years.""Huge volcanic eruptions can produce sulfuric acid aerosols in the stratosphere and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which causes global climate changes. This rapid climate change is believed to be behind the loss of land and marine creatures.Coronene is a highly condensed six-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which requires significantly higher energy to form as compared to smaller PAHs. Therefore, high temperature volcanic combustion can cause the coronene enrichments. This means that high temperature combustion of hydrocarbons in the sedimentary rocks by lateral intrusion of magmas formed COKaiho's team is now studying other mass extinctions in the hopes of further understanding the cause and processes behind them.",Climate,2020.0,"There have been five mass extinctions since early animal evolution, with the largest occurring roughly 252 million years ago at the end of the Permian period.

Apparently formed at a time when the area was ice-free but now completely frozen in, the lake bed may be hundreds of thousands or millions of years old, and contain unique fossil and chemical traces of past climates and life. Scientists consider such data vital to understanding what the Greenland ice sheet may do in coming years as climate warms, and thus the site makes a tantalizing target for drilling. A paper describing the discovery is in press at the journal ","""This could be an important repository of information, in a landscape that right now is totally concealed and inaccessible,"" said Guy Paxman, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and lead author of the report. ""We're working to try and understand how the Greenland ice sheet has behaved in the past. It's important if we want to understand how it will behave in future decades."" The ice sheet, which has been melting at an accelerating pace in recent years, contains enough water to raise global sea levels by about 24 feet.The researchers mapped out the lake bed by analyzing data from airborne geophysical instruments that can read signals that penetrate the ice and provide images of the geologic structures below. Most of the data came from aircraft flying at low altitude over the ice sheet as part of NASA's Operation IceBridge.The team says the basin once hosted a lake covering about 7,100 square kilometers (2,700 square miles), about the size of the U.S. states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. Sediments in the basin, shaped vaguely like a meat cleaver, appear to range as much as 1.2 kilometers (three quarters of a mile) thick. The geophysical images show a network of at least 18 apparent onetime stream beds carved into the adjoining bedrock in a sloping escarpment to the north that must have fed the lake. The image also show at least one apparent outlet stream to the south. The researchers calculate that the water depth in the onetime lake ranged from about 50 meters to 250 meters (a maximum of about 800 feet).In recent years, scientists have found existing subglacial lakes in both Greenland and Antarctica, containing liquid water sandwiched in the ice, or between bedrock and ice. This is the first time anyone has spotted a fossil lake bed, apparently formed when there was no ice, and then later covered over and frozen in place. There is no evidence that the Greenland basin contains liquid water today.Paxman says there is no way to tell how old the lake bed is. Researchers say it is likely that ice has periodically advanced and retreated over much of Greenland for the last 10 million years, and maybe going back as far as 30 million years. A 2016 study led by Lamont-Doherty geochemist Joerg Schaefer has suggested that most of the Greenland ice may have melted for one or more extended periods some time in the last million years or so, but the details of that are sketchy. This particular area could have been repeatedly covered and uncovered, Paxman said, leaving a wide range of possibilities for the lake's history. In any case, Paxman says, the substantial depth of the sediments in the basin suggest that they must have built up during ice-free times over hundreds of thousands or millions of years.""If we could get at those sediments, they could tell us when the ice was present or absent,"" he said.The researchers assembled a detailed picture of the lake basin and its surroundings by analyzing radar, gravity and magnetic data gathered by NASA. Ice-penetrating radar provided a basic topographic map of the earth' s surface underlying the ice. This revealed the outlines of the smooth, low-lying basin, nestled among higher-elevation rocks. Gravity measurements showed that the material in the basin is less dense than the surrounding hard, metamorphic rocks -- evidence that it is composed of sediments washed in from the sides. Measurements of magnetism (sediments are less magnetic than solid rock) helped the team map the depths of the sediments.The researchers say the basin may have formed along a now long-dormant fault line, when the bedrock stretched out and formed a low spot. Alternatively, but less likely, previous glaciations may have carved out the depression, leaving it to fill with water when the ice receded.What the sediments might contain is a mystery. Material washed out from the edges of the ice sheet have been found to contain the remains of pollen and other materials, suggesting that Greenland may have undergone warm periods during the last million years, allowing plants and maybe even forests to take hold. But the evidence is not conclusive, in part because it is hard to date such loose materials. The newly discovered lake bed, in contrast, could provide an intact archive of fossils and chemical signals dating to a so-far unknown distant past.The basin ""may therefore be an important site for future sub-ice drilling and the recovery of sediment records that may yield valuable insights into the glacial, climatological and environmental history"" of the region, the researchers write. With the top of the sediments lying 1.8 kilometers below the current ice surface (1.1 miles), such drilling would be daunting, but not impossible. In the 1990s, researchers penetrated almost 2 miles into the summit of the Greenland ice sheet and recovered several feet of bedrock -- at the time, the deepest ice core ever drilled. The feat, which took five years, has not since been repeated in Greenland, but a new project aimed at reaching shallower bedrock in another part of northwest Greenland is being planned for the next few years.The study was coauthored Jacqueline Austermann and Kirsty Tinto, both also based at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

But they are slowly dying -- some estimates say 30 to 50 percent of reefs have been lost -- due to climate change.,"In a new study, University of Wisconsin-Madison physicists observed reef-forming corals at the nanoscale and identified how they create their skeletons. The results provide an explanation for how corals are resistant to acidifying oceans caused by rising carbon dioxide levels and suggest that controlling water temperature, not acidity, is crucial to mitigating loss and restoring reefs.""Coral reefs are currently threatened by climate change. It's not in the future, it's in the present,"" says Pupa Gilbert, a physics professor at UW-Madison and senior author of the study. ""How corals deposit their skeletons is fundamentally important to assess and help their survival.""Reef-forming corals are marine animals that produce a hard skeleton made up of aragonite, one form of the mineral calcium carbonate. But how the skeletons grow has remained unclear. One model suggests that dissolved calcium and carbonate ions in the corals' calcifying fluid attach one at a time into the crystalline aragonite of the growing skeleton. A different model, proposed by Gilbert and colleagues in 2017 and based on a study of one species of coral, suggests instead that undissolved nanoparticles attach and then slowly crystallize.In the first part of a new study, published Nov. 9 in the PEEM results showed amorphous nanoparticles present in the coral tissue, at the growing surface, and in the region between the tissue and the skeleton, but never in the mature skeleton itself, supporting the nanoparticle attachment model. However, they also showed that while the growing edge is not densely packed with calcium carbonate, the mature skeleton is -- a result that does not support the nanoparticle attachment model.""If you imagine a bunch of spheres, you can never fill space completely; there is always space in between spheres,"" Gilbert says. ""So that was the first indication that nanoparticle attachment may not be the only method.""The researchers next used a technique that measures the exposed internal surface area of porous materials. Large geologic crystals of aragonite or calcite -- formed by something not living -- are found to have around 100 times less surface area than the same amount of material made up of nanoparticles. When they applied this method to corals, their skeletons gave nearly the same value as large crystals, not nanoparticle materials.""Corals fill space as much as a single crystal of calcite or aragonite. Thus, both ion attachment and particle attachment must occur,"" Gilbert says. ""The two separate camps advocating for particles versus ions are actually both right.""This new understanding of coral skeleton formation can only make sense if one more thing is true: that seawater is not in direct contact with the growing skeleton, as has been commonly assumed. In fact, recent studies of the coral calcifying fluid found that it contains slightly higher concentrations of calcium and three times more bicarbonate ions than seawater does, supporting the idea that the growing skeleton is indeed isolated from seawater.Instead, the researchers propose a model where the corals pump calcium and carbonate ions from seawater through coral tissue, which concentrates those minerals near the skeleton. Importantly, this control allows corals to regulate their internal ion concentrations, even as oceans acidify due to rising carbon dioxide levels.""Up until this work, people had assumed that there was contact between seawater and the growing skeleton. We demonstrated that the skeleton is completely separate from seawater, and this has immediate consequences,"" Gilbert says. ""If there are to be coral reef remediation strategies, they should not focus on countering ocean acidification, they should focus on countering ocean warming. To save coral reefs we should lower the temperature, not increase water pH.""Support for this study comes from the U.S. Department of Energy (DE-FG02-07ER15899), the National Science Foundation (DMR-1603192), and the European Research Council (grant agreement No 755876).

Up to 80 percent of the dust came from what is now north-west Argentina, from where it was transported almost completely around the globe by the prevailing westerly winds. After a voyage of up to 20,000 kilometres, it contributed significantly to the increased input of iron into the glacial South Pacific. The dust input from Australia, which dominates in the South Pacific today, played only a minor role.""We have analysed the chemical fingerprint of the dust and compared it with geological data from several continents. This was laborious work, like a jigsaw puzzle,"" says Struve, a post-doctoral scientist in the research group ""Marine Isotope Geochemistry"" at the University's Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment (ICBM). The team included researchers from his group as well as colleagues from the Alfred Wegener Institute -- Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven (Germany), and from Columbia University, New York (USA).The researchers sampled 18 sediment cores from the South Pacific between Antarctica, New Zealand and Chile, a study area which is roughly the size of Russia. Subsequently, they investigated the chemical composition of the dust contained in the samples. ""This dust ultimately stems from rock, which has characteristic properties depending on its place of origin and geologic history so that each source has its own signature,"" Struve explains.The researchers focused on trace metals, in particular rare earth elements and specific isotopes, that is variants of different weight, of the elements neodymium, lead and strontium. This signature is preserved over millions of years and thus provides reliable information about the origin of rock particles even after 20,000 years.At that time, the last Ice Age was at its peak. According to the results, westerly winds blew dust particles from the eastern side of the central Andes in South America across the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. As such, the iron-bearing dust was transported once around the globe before being deposited in the middle latitudes of the South Pacific. Since algae in these waters usually lack iron as a crucial nutrient for growth, iron-containing dust acts as a natural fertiliser until today.Like all plants, phytoplankton -- microscopic algae -- absorbs carbon by means of photosynthesis and thus reduces the proportion of carbon dioxide (COIt was already known that the iron input during the last ice age was much higher than during the present warm period.

""Global warming has changed the winds and environmental conditions in the source regions,"" Struve says, who continues to study the sediment cores.

Anthropogenic CO,"With most of the world's reefs under stress, ""coral gardening"" or ""outplanting"" has become a popular and promising solution for restoration. Outplanting involves transplanting nursery-grown coral fragments onto degraded reefs. When successful, outplanting helps build coral biomass and restore reef function; but even with thousands of corals outplanted each year, the results are mixed. Newly settled corals are particularly vulnerable to stressors such as pollution, unfavorable light conditions, and temperature fluctuations. Therefore, identifying which stressors have the greatest bearing on coral health and survival is crucial for ensuring successful reef restoration.A recent study published in ""New restoration protocols can use remotely sensed data of multiple oceanographic variables to assess the environmental history of a site. This will help evaluate and optimize site selection and give their outplants the best chance of survival.,"" said Shawna Foo, lead author and postdoctoral researcher at GDCS.The study was based on an analysis of coral outplanting projects worldwide between 1987 and 2019.

Furthermore, such extreme events could go from being rare to common events by the end of the century, according to the study, published November 9 in the journal ""In a way, the 'Day Zero' drought might have been a sort of taste of what the future may be,"" said lead author Salvatore Pascale, a research scientist at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). ""In the worst-case scenario, events like the 'Day Zero' drought may become about 100 times more likely than what they were in the early 20th-century world.""Using a climate modeling system known as the Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research (SPEAR), the researchers simulated the response of atmospheric circulation patterns to increasing levels of carbon dioxide.The model found that in a high greenhouse gas-emissions scenario, a devastating drought like the one that crippled Cape Town could impact the region two or three times in a decade. Even in an intermediate-emissions scenario, the risk of multi-year droughts that are more extreme and last longer than the ""Day Zero"" drought will increase by the end of the century.The new research uses higher resolution models than were previously available and supports the conclusions of past studies that projected an increase in drought risk. The findings underscore the area's sensitivity to further emissions and need for aggressive water management.""The information we can provide now with these new tools is much more precise,"" Pascale said. ""We can say with a higher degree of confidence that the role anthropogenic climate change has had so far has been quite large.""Other parts of the world with similar climates to South Africa -- including California, southern Australia, southern Europe and parts of South America -- could experience their own Zero Day droughts in the future, according to the researchers.

A worrying 16% of species have lost over half their estimated natural historical range, a figure that could rise to 26% by the end of the century.Species' geographical ranges were found to have recently shrunk most significantly in tropical areas. Until around 50 years ago, most agricultural development was in Europe and North America. Since then, large areas of land have been converted for agriculture in the tropics: clearance of rainforest for oil palm plantations in South East Asia, and for pasture land in South America, for example.As humans move their activities deeper into the tropics, the effect on species ranges is becoming disproportionately larger because of a greater species richness in these areas, and because the natural ranges of these species are smaller to begin with.""The tropics are biodiversity hotspots with lots of small-range species. If one hectare of tropical forest is converted to agricultural land, a lot more species lose larger proportions of their home than in places like Europe,"" said Beyer.The results predict that climate change will have an increasing impact on species' geographical ranges. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns will alter habitats significantly, for example: other studies have predicted that without climate action, large parts of the Amazon may change from canopy rainforest to a savannah-like mix of woodland and open grassland in the next 100 years.""Species in the Amazon have adapted to living in a tropical rainforest. If climate change causes this ecosystem to change, many of those species won't be able to survive -- or they will at least be pushed into smaller areas of remaining rainforest,"" said Beyer.He added: ""We found that the higher the carbon emissions, the worse it gets for most species in terms of habitat loss.""The results provide quantitative support for policy measures aiming at limiting the global area of agricultural land -- for example by sustainably intensifying food production, encouraging dietary shifts towards eating less meat, and stabilising population growth.The conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural and urban land, and the transformation of suitable habitat caused by climate change are major causes of the decline in range sizes, and two of the most important threats to global terrestrial biodiversity.""Whether these past trends in habitat range losses will reverse, continue, or accelerate will depend on future global carbon emissions and societal choices in the coming years and decades,"" Professor Andrea Manica in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, who led the study.He added: ""While our study quantifies the drastic consequences for species' ranges if global land use and climate change are left unchecked, they also demonstrate the tremendous potential of timely and concerted policy action for halting -- and indeed partially reversing -- previous trends in global range contractions. It all depends on what we do next.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change has found that the habitat size of almost all known birds, mammals and amphibians is shrinking as a result of human activities such as land conversion for agriculture and urbanisation.

426,6-Nov-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201105183811.htm,After election: Making the endangered species act more effective,"For forty-seven years, the Endangered Species Act has stood as the nation's strongest and most effective law for protecting animals and plants threatened with extinction -- from the bald eagle to the American burying beetle, the Alabama leather flower to the Aleutian shield fern.","In 2019, the Trump Administration made the most sweeping changes to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act in decades -- making it harder for the federal government to protect the habitats that plants and animals will need in a warmer future. Many biologists and environmental groups have called for these rules to be reversed, to simply return to the Obama era rules.Now a leading group of conservation scientists and ESA policy experts are making the case that a ""rule reversal"" will not be sufficient to allow the Act to do its job of protecting species. Instead, they're calling for deeper improvements to the rules the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service use to apply the law -- aiming to make the Act more effective and to gain bipartisan and industry support in an era of accelerating climate change.The team's analysis and policy recommendations were published on November 5 in the journal ""It's not enough to just go back to where we were eighteen months ago; we need reform,"" says University of Vermont conservation biologist Joe Roman, one of the co-authors on the new policy study. ""We're not talking about revising the Act itself -- that legislative can of worms -- but it is clear that endangered species, wildlife agencies, landowners, and citizens would all benefit by updating the regulations and policies that are used to implement the law.""At the center of the team's call for reform is a need for clarity.Consider the divergent cases of the Pacific walrus and the Arctic ringed seal. Both animals face similar threats from rapid losses of sea ice and snow cover. But a 2017 decision not to protect the walrus was based on climate projections that went out only to 2060, because the Fish & Wildlife Service considered conclusions beyond this date to be ""based on speculation, rather than reliable prediction."" However, five years earlier, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed the seal as ""threatened"" based on modeling that was presented as ""reliable"" out to 2100, the same time horizon as the authoritative modeling of the IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and others.In short, the wildlife services have had an ad hoc and inconsistent approach to defining the ""foreseeable future,"" -- and other ESA rules. ""This kind of ambiguity hurts everybody,"" says Ya-Wei (Jake) Li, an expert on the Endangered Species Act at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center and the lead author of the new study in For example, once the National Marine Fisheries Service had ""concluded that the extent of the of sea ice loss was reliably foreseeable to 2100, any conflicting decisions should explain why that conclusion was wrong,"" write the team of scientists, including Li, Roman, David S. Wilcove at Princeton University, Timothy Male at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center, and Holly Doremus at the University of California, Berkeley. ""What is required is consistency and transparency.""The federal wildlife services, the team argues, should clarify the principles that guide their decisions, provide more public access to the data behind decisions, and give clear explanations of how they exercise discretion in offering -- or not offering -- protections to threatened species.In a puzzling case, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, using a so-called ESA 4(d) rule, offered the Gunnison sage grouse full protections on agricultural lands, but the related lesser prairie chicken was exempted from similar protections on the same kind of farmland. ""The agency may have had valid reasons for this discrepancy, but they never publicly explained those reasons,"" the team writes.""The recommendations that we're focusing on provide the public with more transparency -- and transparency alone can really help reduce a lot of the controversy"" that has mired the ESA in recent years, says Jake Li. ""But we're also advocating for new ideas that would bring better science and more flexible approaches to the decisions the wildlife services make.""For example, in the wake of this presidential election, a new package of regulation and funding for working with landowners -- to offer tax incentives for easements and land donations -- could unlock recovery opportunities for the many threatened plants and animals that persist on private lands. And investments in remote sensing and other technologies could give a better view of how climate change will impact the nearly 2,400 species protected by the ESA.""A strong majority of Americans supports the Endangered Species Act and sees wildlife and wild plants as a public good,"" says Joe Roman, a professor in UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment & Natural Resources and Gund Institute for Environment. ""So what will it take to help landowners protect these species? Think of what could happen if we got federal decisionmakers, governors, conservationists, industry leaders to sit down together to help both species and landowners. With the right leadership, you could get broad bipartisan support to make the Endangered Species Act an even better tool for preventing the loss of biodiversity.""",Climate,2020.0,"A group of conservation scientists and Endangered Species Act (ESA) policy experts have called for deeper improvements to the rules used to apply the law, stating that a ""rule reversal"" will not be sufficient to allow the Act to protect species effectively. The team is urging for clarity and consistency in defining the ""foreseeable future"" and other ESA rules.

427,5-Nov-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201105183834.htm,Global-scale animal ecology reveals behavioral changes in response to climate change,"Using a new large-scale data archive of animal movement studies, an international team including University of Maryland biologists found that animals are responding in unexpected ways to climate change. The archive contains data from studies across the global Arctic and sub-Arctic, an enormous region that is experiencing some of the most dramatic effects of global warming, including animal declines.","After developing the archive, the researchers used it to conduct three case studies that revealed surprising patterns and associations between climate change and the behavior of golden eagles, bears, caribou, moose and wolves. This work demonstrates both the feasibility and importance of studying animal ecology on extremely large scales. A research paper describing the archive and case studies appears in the November 6, 2020, issue of the journal ""I'm really excited about how this work shows what you can learn from comparing data across populations on a very large scale,"" said Elie Gurarie, an associate research scientist in UMD's Department of Biology and a co-author of the paper. ""I would say this is an early example of what we might call global animal movement ecology. We're increasing our ability to monitor the pulse of animal populations across the Earth and ask big picture questions about what it means.""Large-scale monitoring of things like sea-surface temperature and global forest cover have revealed important information about the response of Earth's systems to climate change and human activity. But big-picture trends in animal behavior have been difficult to study, in part because animal ecology is not traditionally studied across landscapes that span entire regions of the globe, and also because the necessary data are collected by a variety of agencies and jurisdictions and are therefore neither standardized nor easily accessible.To address these issues, Gurarie and his collaborators spent years building relationships with scientists from national, regional and First Nations governments and research groups throughout the Arctic to convey the benefits of sharing data in a global repository that they call the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA). Currently, the archive includes contributions from researchers from over 100 universities, government agencies and conservation groups across 17 countries.The archive includes data from 201 terrestrial and marine animal tracking studies representing more than 8,000 animals between 1991 and the present. Using this data, Gurarie and members of his lab analyzed the movements of more than 900 female caribou from 2000 to 2017. They found that the iconic long-distance migrating caribou are giving birth earlier in the spring, roughly tracking rates of warming. But among the non-migratory mountain and lowland woodland caribou only the northern sub-populations are showing similar changes. While the drivers of these differences remain a mystery, understanding their behavior is critical to anticipating how they will respond as the Arctic continues to warm and many populations continue to decline.""It's tricky to predict how these trends might impact populations,"" Gurarie said. ""On the one hand, it can be better to give birth earlier, as it gives the calves more opportunity to grow during the summer season. On the other hand, giving birth too early may mean you literally don't have time to reach the optimal calving grounds. The ability to look at biological processes, like birth, at such a large scale, across populations and subspecies and over millions of square kilometers, is unprecedented for a species in such a remote and harsh environment. These results reveal patterns that we would not have suspected, and point to further lines of inquiry about everything from caribou evolution to their ability to adapt to environmental changes moving forward.""Data analysis tools Gurarie developed to study caribou were also used for another case study led by his collaborators.In an analysis comparing movements of more than 100 golden eagles from 1993 to 2017, Scott LaPoint, a researcher from Columbia University who is now at Black Rock Forest Consortium, found that immature birds migrating north in the spring arrived earlier following mild winters, while adult birds did not. The timing shift for young birds varied in response to a large-scale climate cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is being affected by climate change. Such age-related behavior changes could only be seen through decades of movement data and may have implications for breeding success.A third study by Peter Mahoney of the University of Washington looked at the movement speeds of bears, caribou, moose and wolves from 1998 to 2019. His study showed that species respond differently to seasonal temperatures and winter snow conditions. Those differences could influence species interactions, food competition and predator-prey dynamics.The scientists expect that other researchers will continue to mine the AAMA for answers to pressing questions about whether and how animals are responding to a changing Arctic. Meanwhile, the resource continues to expand as more data comes in from currently tracked animals and more researchers add their studies.""This work has given us a baseline to understand the large-scale picture so we can get a sense of how animals and environments are really interacting across species and across space as the environment changes,"" Gurarie said.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have built a global repository of animal tracking data, called the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA), which includes data from more than 201 terrestrial and marine animal tracking studies, representing over 8,000 animals between 1991 and the present.

""If your model can simulate past climates accurately, it likely will do a much better job at getting future scenarios right.""As more and better information becomes available about climates in Earth's distant history, reaching back many millions of years before humans existed, past climates become increasingly relevant for improving our understanding of how key elements of the climate system are affected by greenhouse gas levels, according to the study's authors. Unlike historic climate records, which typically only go back a century or two -- a mere blink of an eye in the planet's climate history -- paleoclimates cover a vastly broader range of climatic conditions that can inform climate models in ways historic data cannot. These periods in Earth's past span a large range of temperatures, precipitation patterns and ice sheet distribution.""Past climates should be used to evaluate and fine-tune climate models,"" Tierney said. ""Looking to the past to inform the future could help narrow uncertainties surrounding projections of changes in temperature, ice sheets, and the water cycle.""Typically, climate scientists evaluate their models with data from historical weather records, such as satellite measurements, sea surface temperatures, wind speeds, cloud cover and other parameters. The model's algorithms are then adjusted and tuned until their predictions mesh with the observed climate records. Thus, if a computer simulation produces a historically accurate climate based on the observations made during that time, it is considered fit to predict future climate with reasonable accuracy.""We find that many models perform very well with historic climates, but not so well with climates from the Earth's geological past,"" Tierney said.One reason for the discrepancies are differences in how the models compute the effects of clouds, which is one of the great challenges in climate modeling, Tierney said. Such differences cause different models to diverge from each other in terms of what climate scientists refer to as climate sensitivity: a measure of how strongly the Earth's climate responds to a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions.Several of the latest generation models that are being used for the next report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, have a higher climate sensitivity than previous iterations, Tierney explained.""This means that if you double carbon dioxide emissions, they produce more global warming than their previous counterparts, so the question is: How much confidence do we have in these very sensitive new models?""In between IPCC reports, which typically are released every eight years, climate models are being updated based on the latest research data.""Models become more complex, and in theory, they get better, but what does that mean?"" Tierney said. ""You want to know what happens in the future, so you want to be able to trust the model with regard to what happens in response to higher levels of carbon dioxide.""While there is no debate in the climate science community about human fossil fuel consumption pushing the Earth toward a warmer state for which there is no historical precedent, different models generate varying predictions. Some forecast an increase as large as 6 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.Tierney said while Earth's atmosphere has experienced carbon dioxide concentrations much higher than today's level of about 400 parts per million, there is no time in the geological record that matches the speed at which humans are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.In the paper, the authors applied climate models to several known past climate extremes from the geological record. The most recent warm climate offering a glimpse into the future occurred about 50 million years ago during the Eocene epoch, Tierney said. Global carbon dioxide was at 1,000 parts per million at that time and there were no large ice sheets.""If we don't cut back emissions, we are headed for Eocene-like COThe authors discuss climate changes all the way to the Cretaceous period, about 90 million years ago, when dinosaurs still ruled the Earth. That period shows that the climate can get even warmer, a scenario that Tierney described as ""even scarier,"" with carbon dioxide levels up to 2,000 parts per million and the oceans as warm as a bathtub.""The key is COSome models are much better than others at producing the climates seen in the geologic record, which underscores the need to test climate models against paleoclimates, the authors said. In particular, past warm climates such as the Eocene highlight the role that clouds play in contributing to warmer temperatures under increased carbon dioxide levels.""We urge the climate community to test models on paleoclimates early on, while the models are being developed, rather than afterwards, which tends to be the current practice,"" Tierney said. ""Seemingly small things like clouds affect the Earth's energy balance in major ways and can affect the temperatures your model produces for the year 2100.""",Climate,2020.0,"Climate model developers should use past climate data to improve the accuracy of their predictions, according to a new study.

As the climate continues to warm, over the long term, increasing water temperatures may interact with changing food webs to pose critical problems for fish populations, the researchers said.""There was a drastic difference in the fish between the two years. It was obvious tuna in one year had very full guts with much bigger prey,"" said Miram Gleiber, the study's lead author. Gleiber worked on the project as part of her doctoral dissertation at Oregon State and has since completed her Ph.D.""This gives us a better understanding of how these fish are surviving in this vulnerable early life stage as temperatures change. It's not just the temperature change that is important, but the impacts on prey are also important.""The study results were published today in the Blackfin tuna are among the smallest tuna species and are one of the most common larval fish found in the Straits of Florida, a region with a high diversity of fish species. Blackfin tunas' diets are similar to other, more commercially popular tuna species such as bluefin and albacore, which make them a good model for studying how tuna respond to constraints in the food web, such as those induced by warming temperatures.""It's common for fish to produce lots of eggs,"" Sponaugle said. ""But past research has shown that any small change that occurs early in a fish's life has big implications down the road. What happens during this larval stage of development can greatly influence the whole population.""Researchers collected hundreds of samples of larval blackfin tuna throughout the Straits of Florida during research cruises in 2014 and 2015. During those cruises, the researchers also documented the prey environment for the fish using an imaging system that measures distribution of zooplankton -- on which the blackfin feed -- in the sampling area.Researchers also collected data on water temperature, which averaged about 1.2 degrees Celsius higher in 2015 than in 2014.""Anecdotally, even before we started our data collection and analysis, you could see there were about 10 times more blackfin tuna in 2014 than in 2015,"" Gleiber said. ""This particular tuna is known to be abundant in this area, so one of the questions we wanted to answer was why were there so many more in one year compared to the other? We thought it might be related to their diet.""Gleiber spent about a year painstakingly dissecting and analyzing the stomach contents of hundreds of larval tuna, which were 3 to 10 millimeters in size, to determine what and how much they were eating. She also removed and studied the fishes' otoliths -- small ear stones that researchers can use to determine the age and growth rate of the fish.""These otoliths are like tiny onions, depositing a little material every day in concentric layers smaller than the width of a human hair. We can use this record just like tree rings to estimate fish age and daily growth,"" Sponaugle said.Fish generally tend to grow faster in warmer temperatures and tuna are a fast-growing species, which heightens their need for adequate food sources.But a comparison of the two years of samples, including stomach contents, growth rate data from the ear stones and information about available prey from the imaging system, showed that in the warmer water conditions, the blackfin ate less, ate different prey that were smaller in size and grew more slowly.""It's not just the temperature that determines their growth. Growth has to be supported with prey availability, as well,"" Gleiber said.Although the study was based on only two years of data, the results indicate a clear relationship between water temperature, the abundance of zooplankton prey and larval fish growth and survival.""We saw these big differences with just a degree or two of temperature change,"" Sponaugle said. ""That's a concern because if prey are not available or are reduced in numbers in warmer conditions, these young tuna just won't survive.""",Climate,2020.0,"Larval blackfin tuna are eating less and growing more slowly due to warmer water conditions, according to a study by researchers at Oregon State University.

430,5-Nov-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201105183739.htm,"To limit global warming, the global food system must be reimagined","Fossil fuel burning accounts for the majority of global greenhouse gas emissions, and to the world's credit, several countries are working to reduce their use and the heat-trapping emissions that ensue. The goal is to keep global temperatures under a 1.5° to 2°C increase above preindustrial levels -- the upper limits of the Paris Climate Agreement.","If we stopped burning all fossil fuels this minute, would that be enough to keep a lid on global warming?Acording to UC Santa Barbara ecology professor David Tilman, petroleum energy sources are only part of the picture. In a paper published in the journal The source? Our food system.""Global food demand and the greenhouse gases associated with it are on a trajectory to push the world past the one-and-a-half degree goal, and make it hard to stay under the two degree limit,"" said Tilman, who holds a dual appointment at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and at the University of Minnesota. The world's growing population as well as its diet are driving food production practices that generate and release massive and increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. According to the paper, left unchecked, agricultural emissions alone could exceed the 1.5°C limit by about 2050.These findings are especially concerning given that we haven't stopped using fossil fuels, Tilman said. And with a 1°C average increase in global temperature since 1880, we've got only a slim margin before global warming results in widespread sea level rise, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss and other effects that will change life as we know it.""All it would take for us to exceed the two degree warming limit is for food emissions to remain on their path and one additional year of current fossil fuel emissions,"" Tilman said. ""And I guarantee you, we're not going to stop fossil fuel emissions in a year.""Reducing the emissions from food production, ""will likely be essential"" to keeping the planet livable in its current state, according to the scientists.""It's well known that agriculture releases about 30% of all greenhouse gases,"" Tilman said. Major sources include deforestation and land clearing, fertilizer overuse and gassy livestock, all of which are increasing as the global population increases. In ""high-yield"" countries such as the U.S., which have the benefit of large scale modern agriculture, intensive animal farming and heavy-handed fertilizer use are major contributors of greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, in ""low yield"" countries such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth and increasing affluence are driving demand for more food, and toward more ""urban"" diets that are richer in meat and meat products, Tilman explained.""Their demand for food is going up, but the farmers don't have the resources to have high yields, so they just clear more and more land,"" he said.And yet, it isn't as though we can just stop producing food, which is perhaps the main reason why agricultural emissions have received less attention than fossil fuels as a target for reduction, according to the researchers.""You can't look at agriculture as if we can somehow get rid of it,"" said Tilman, whose research focuses on the environmental impacts of agriculture, as well as the links between diet, environment and health. ""We need it; it's essential for society.""But, according to the paper's authors, global warming does not have to be an unavoidable impact of feeding the the world. Through early and widespread adoption of several feasible food system strategies, it is possible to limit emissions from agriculture in a way that keeps us from exceeding the 2°C limit by the end of the century while feeding a growing population.The most effective, according to the paper, is a switch toward more plant-rich diets, which aren't just healthier overall, but also reduce the demand for beef and other ruminant meats. That, in turn, reduces the pressure to clear for grazing land or produce the grains and grasses (more farming, more fertilizer) required to feed them.""We're not saying these diets have to be vegetarian or vegan,"" Tilman said. Widespread reduction of red meat consumption to once a week and having protein come from other sources such as chicken or fish, while increasing fruits and vegetables, in conjunction with decreasing fossil fuel use, could help keep the planet livably cool in the long run.Another strategy: ease up on fertilizer.""Many countries have high yields because from 1960 until now they have been using more and more fertilizer,"" he said. ""But recent research has shown that almost all of these countries are actually using much more than they need to attain the yield they have."" A drop of roughly 30% in fertilizer use would not only save the farmer money for the same yield, it prevents the release of nitrous oxide that occurs when excess fertilizer goes unused.""About 40% of all future climate warming from agriculture may come from nitrous oxide from fertilizer,"" Tilman added. ""So adding the right amount of fertilizer has a large benefit for climate change and would save farmers money.""Other strategies the researchers explored included adjusting global per capita calorie consumption to healthy levels; improving yields to help meet demand where it may reduce the pressure to clear more land; and reducing food waste by half.""The nice thing is that we can do each of these things sort of halfway and still solve the problem,"" Tilman said. The sooner we employ these strategies, the closer we can get to keeping the Earth cool and avoiding the wholesale changes we would have to adopt if we wait too much longer, he added.""I'm optimistic,"" he said.

In fact, compared with unmodified Kraft lignin, by using the modified polymer the fiber mat exhibited an almost 3-fold improvement in mechanical strength.""Our fibers' mechanical performance is attributable to the tailored graphitic structure of the materials,"" explains Szabó. ""This outcome is owing to the improved polymer interactions leading to a more aligned polymeric network which is then subjected to the thermal treatment.""Engineered composites are common in spacecraft, cars, plastic, concrete, and many other products and technologies.

This could be bad news for species that depend on stable and abundant access to food at certain times of the year.,"""If the changes happen too fast, species can become extinct,"" says Emily Simmonds, an associate professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) Department of Biology.She is the first author of an article in Several bird species depend on the abundance of larvae while their young are small. If the larvae supply peaks earlier in the spring than normal, there may simply be too little food for the hatchlings.The warming climate can bring about changes like this. An earlier spring causes trees to leaf out earlier, which in turn causes the larvae that feed on the plants to hatch out earlier.""When the climate changes, the interactions between different species changes too,"" Simmonds says.She and a team of researchers at the University of Oxford used population models to calculate the consequences of different climate scenarios. They wanted to see at what point the changes would happen too fast for the great tit to modify its behaviour quickly enough to keep up with the larvae.Great tits have genetic variations and varying abilities to adapt to different conditions. This means that they can evolve in tandem with their prey up to a point.An earlier larvae hatch can be advantageous for the great tits that also hatch their young earlier in the spring. This advantage can be transferred to the next generation of birds, which can in turn become early birds. And so on.For this advantage to last, the great tits have to evolve fast enough and be flexible enough to keep up with the genetic variation in their prey.""Given conditions with big greenhouse gas emissions, the great tits won't always be able to keep up with the changes in the larvae supply,"" says Simmonds.In the worst case scenario, whole populations of great tits will simply disappear by the year 2100 because they aren't able to procure enough food for their young.""This could happen even if the great tits are also modifying their behaviour faster in a rapidly changing environment. The larvae might be changing even faster than the great tits,"" Simmonds says.The researchers found that populations of great tits would be guaranteed to become extinct by the year 2100 if the larvae appeared about 24 days earlier than the current norm in 2020. This also applies to populations that appear to be completely stable now.""It could be that the apparent stability today is hiding a future collapse,"" says Simmonds.The reason is that we might reach a kind of threshold where the great tits aren't keeping up. The rubber band gets stretched too far, you could say.""The good news is that the populations will be able to survive scenarios with lower or medium warming trends,"" Simmonds says.Simmonds collaborated with Dr. Ella Cole, Professor Ben Sheldon and Professor Tim Coulson at the University of Oxford on the project, which was part of Simmonds' doctoral dissertation at the British university.",Climate,2020.0,"Changes in climate, particularly an earlier spring, can cause a shift in the availability of food for bird species such as the great tit, according to a study by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and the University of Oxford.

In recent years, their breeding grounds in the coastal tussac (Poa flabellata) grasslands have come under increasing pressure from sheep grazing and erosion. And unlike other regions of the globe, there has been no long-term monitoring of the responses of these burrowing and ground nesting seabirds to climate change.","A 14,000-year paleoecological reconstruction of the sub-Antarctic islands done by an international research team led by The University of Maine (UMaine) including Dr Moriaki YASUHARA from the School of Biological Sciences and The Swire Institute of Marine Science, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), has found that seabird establishment occurred during a period of regional cooling 5,000 years ago. Their populations, in turn, shifted the Falkland Island ecosystem through the deposit of high concentrations of guano that helped nourish tussac, produce peat and increase the incidence of fire. The findings were recently published in the journal ""This terrestrial-marine link is critical to the islands' grasslands conservation efforts going forward,"" says Dulcinea GROFF, who led the research as a PhD student in UMaine. ""The connection of nutrients originating in the marine ecosystem that are transferred to the terrestrial ecosystem enrich the islands' nutrient-poor soil, thereby making the Falkland Islands sensitive to changes in climate and land use.""Our work emphasizes just how important the nutrients in seabird poop are for the ongoing efforts to restore and conserve their grassland habitats. It also raises the question about where seabirds will go as the climate continues to warm,"" said Groff, who conducted the research in the Falkland Islands during expeditions in 2014 and 2016 led by Jacquelyn GILL, an Associate Professor of paleoecology and plant ecology in the UMaine Climate Change Institute.The UMaine expedition team collected a 476-centimeter peat column from Surf Bay, East Falkland. The 14,000-year record revealed in the undecomposed tussac leaves of the peat column captures the development of a terrestrial-marine linkage that supports some of the most important breeding colonies of seabirds in the Southern Ocean today.The absence of seabirds at the East Falklands site prior to 5,000 years ago suggests that seabirds may be sensitive to warmer mediated sea surface temperatures, which can impact their food supply, according to the research team. With a warming South Atlantic today, the question is whether the Falkland Islands, about 300 miles east of South America, will continue to be a seabird breeding ""hot spot."" The research team suggests that as the Southern Ocean continues to warm in the coming decades, the Falkland Islands seabird communities may undergo abrupt turnover or collapse, which could happen on the order of decades.The 14,000-year record from East Falkland revealed that for 9,000 years before the arrival of seabirds, the region was dominated by low levels of grasses, a heathland of ferns and dwarf Ericaceous shrubs. About 5,000 years ago, the researchers says, an ""abrupt transition"" appears to occur. Concentrations in bio-elements such as phosphorus and zinc increase. Grass pollen accumulation rates skyrocket, indicating the establishment of tussac grasslands within 200 years of the establishment of seabird colonies on the island. Also found in the core: increased accumulation rates of peat and charcoal. ""This timing is consistent with that of the Southern Ocean cooling that known paleoclimatic records consistently indicate.,"" said Yasuhara, a paleoecologist and paleoclimatologist in HKU, who is familiar with polar paleoclimatology and paleoceanography.It is clear that the addition of seabird populations bringing nutrients from the marine environment to the island drove changes in the terrestrial plant community structure, composition and function, as well as increased fire activity and nutrient cycling. What remains unclear is what drove the abrupt ecosystem shift, including the impacts of climate change and extinction, and the geographical distribution of living things through space and time.""Our study is also a powerful reminder of why we need to understand how different ecosystems are connected as the world warms,"" says Gill. ""Such understanding is especially important in polar regions and ecosystems that are known to be sensitive to climate change,"" continues Yasuhara. Gill concluded, ""We know that many seabirds in the South Atlantic rely on these unique coastal grasslands, but it turns out that the grasses also depend on the nutrients seabirds provide. Because they rely on ecosystems in the ocean and on land for their survival, seabirds are really excellent sentinels of global change. We just don't have good long-term monitoring data for most of these species, so we don't know enough about how sensitive they are to climate change. The fossil record can help us fill in the gaps.""",Climate,2020.0,"Seabirds established on the Falkland Islands during a period of regional cooling 5,000 years ago, according to a 14,000-year paleoecological reconstruction of the sub-Antarctic islands by an international research team led by the University of Maine.

Lynée Turek-Hankins of Stanford University (now currently at the University of Miami) and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal,"As climate change progresses, governments are increasingly interested in equity-oriented policies to aid communities that may be particularly at risk of health impacts and death due to extreme heat. Risk may vary between communities according to unique socioeconomic, health, and environmental factors. However, how to accurately identify vulnerable communities is unclear.To gain new insight, Turek-Hankins and colleagues conducted a systematic comparison of three methods to measure a community's vulnerability to climate change. They compared the CalEnviroScreen 3.0 index, which focuses on pollution; the Social Vulnerability Index, which applies to all types of disasters; and the Heat-Health Action Index, which identifies areas particularly vulnerable to heat-related health impacts.The analysis found that CalEnviroScreen 3.0 identified 25 percent of California's communities as ""disadvantaged."" However, the other two indices identified an additional 12.6 percent of communities as being vulnerable to health impacts of extreme heat, and just 13.4 percent of communities were found to be vulnerable across all three indices.These findings are notable because CalEnviroScreen 3.0 is currently used by California to help determine which communities receive projects to adapt to the effects of climate change -- including extreme heat. In fact, communities identified as vulnerable by CalEnviroScreen 3.0 but not the Heat-Health Action Index have received four times as many heat-related projects as those found vulnerable by the Heat-Health Action Index but not CalEnviroScreen 3.0.These findings suggest that any single index on its own could overlook key nuances and prevent vulnerable communities from being selected for heat-related adaptation projects. The authors call for a more holistic approach to quantify not only vulnerability to extreme heat, but also vulnerability to other climate hazards.The authors add: ""Government and community members across the country are ambitiously ramping up efforts for equity-oriented climate change adaptation, but questions about how to effectively identify and prioritize limited funding across communities in practice remain. Using a program from the state of California as a case study, we demonstrate that the selection of ""disadvantaged"" communities for adaptation funding as well as perceptions of overall risk depend greatly on the metrics one deploys.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have compared three methods of measuring a community's vulnerability to climate change.

For example, communities may have powerful reasons for refusing to abandon a particular place.""The researchers developed a new 12,000-year sea-level curve for the Isles of Scilly, and looked at this alongside new landscape, vegetation and human population reconstructions created from pollen and charcoal data and archaeological evidence gathered. The new research extends and enhances data collected by the Lyonesse Project (2009 to 2013), a study of the historic coastal and marine environment of the Isles of Scilly.These findings suggest that during a period between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago land was rapidly becoming submerged. In response to this period of coastline reorganisation, people appeared to adapt to, rather than abandon, the new landscape.By the Bronze Age (after 4400 years ago), the archaeological record suggests the area had a permanent population -- and instead of leaving the islands, it appears that there may have been a ""significant acceleration of activity.""The reasons for this are unclear, but one possibility is that new shallow seas and tidal zones provided opportunities for fishing, shellfish collection and hunting wildfowl.This period of rapid land loss happened at a time of relatively slow sea-level rise -- because lots of Scilly's land at that point was relatively flat and close to sea level.The study found that between 5000 and 4,000 years ago, land was being lost at a rate of 10,000 m2 per year, which is equivalent to a large international rugby stadium. However, about half of this land was turning into intertidal habitats, which may have been able to support the coastal communities.Charlie Johns (Cornwall Archaeological Unit) co-director of the Lyonesse Project said ""This new research confirms that the period immediately before 4,000 years ago saw some of the most significant loss of land at any time in the history of Scilly -- equivalent to losing two-thirds of the entire modern area of the islands.""After 4,000 years ago, the island group continued to be submerged by rising sea levels, even during modest (e.g., 1 mm per year) rates of sea-level rise.""It is clear that rapid coastal change can happen even during relatively small and gradual sea-level rise,"" said Dr Barnett.""The current rate of mean global sea-level rise (around 3.6 mm per year) is already far greater than the local rate at the Isles of Scilly (1 to 2 mm per year) that caused widespread coastal reorganisation between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago.""It is even more important to consider the human responses to these physical changes, which may be unpredictable.""As can be seen today across island nations, cultural practices define the response of coastal communities, which can result in polarised agenda, such as the planned relocation programmes in Fiji versus the climate-migration resistance seen in Tavalu.""In the past, we saw that coastal reorganisation at the Isles of Scilly led to new resource availability for coastal communities.""It is perhaps unlikely that future coastal reorganisation will lead to new resource availability on scales capable of supporting entire communities.""More certain though, is that societal and cultural perspectives from coastal populations will be critical for responding successfully to future climate change.""The research was funded by a grant from English Heritage (now Historic England) to the Cornwall Council Historic Environment Service (now Cornwall Archaeological Unit).

A team of scientists from eDNAtec Inc. and colleagues from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Memorial University present these findings in the open-access journal,"The ability to monitor deep-sea fish diversity is necessary for implementing sustainable management efforts and understanding the impacts of commercial fishing and climate change. However, existing methods such as baited camera traps, trawling, and acoustic monitoring, have limited detection capabilities and are difficult to use in much of the ocean.A newer method called eDNA metabarcoding reveals which fish are present in a given habitat by analyzing environmental DNA (eDNA) -- DNA that is shed by organisms into the surrounding environment as they go about their normal activities.To evaluate the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding for detecting deep-sea fish, McClenaghan and colleagues applied it to seawater samples collected from the Labrador Sea at depths of up to 2,500 meters. In deep-sea water samples (depths of 1,400 meters or greater), eDNA metabarcoding identified 11 fish families, 11 genera, and 8 species. The researchers compared their eDNA metabarcoding results to those obtained by conventional methods and found that they provided broader coverage of fish diversity and other taxa while using significantly less logistical effort. These advantages make eDNA techniques an important advancement for large-scale monitoring applications.The research team also explored eDNA metabarcoding using various volumes of deep-ocean seawater samples and different DNA primers -- short strands of DNA applied in the laboratory analysis of eDNA to determine which species are present. Their findings suggest that the deep ocean environment requires some adjustments to methods used in shallower waters, such as using larger volumes of water and the use of multiple primers to maximize species detection.While the authors plan to further refine eDNA metabarcoding procedures for the unique nature of the deep-sea environment, they note that this method already can provide important insights for monitoring fish diversity in the deep ocean.The authors add: ""Advances in genomics and computational tools are rapidly expanding our ability to study and monitor biodiversity, a much needed task in the face of rapid and vast environmental change.

In only six years -- from 2012 to 2018 -- the compute needed for deep learning has grown 300,000%.

Although summer didn't bring widespread relief, the connection between the weather and COVID-19 continues to be a hot topic.","The link between weather and COVID-19 is complicated. Weather influences the environment in which the coronavirus must survive before infecting a new host. But it also influences human behavior, which moves the virus from one host to another.Research led by The University of Texas at Austin is adding some clarity on weather's role in COVID-19 infection, with a new study finding that temperature and humidity do not play a significant role in coronavirus spread.That means whether it's hot or cold outside, the transmission of COVID-19 from one person to the next depends almost entirely on human behavior.""The effect of weather is low and other features such as mobility have more impact than weather,"" said Dev Niyogi, a professor at UT Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences and Cockrell School of Engineering who led the research.

At each scale, the researchers adjusted their analyses so that population differences did not skew results.Across scales, the scientists found that the weather had nearly no influence. When it was compared with other factors using a statistical metric that breaks down the relative contribution of each factor toward a particular outcome, the weather's relative importance at the county scale was less than 3%, with no indication that a specific type of weather promoted spread over another.In contrast, the data showed the clear influence of human behavior -- and the outsized influence of individual behaviors.

An event like this unleashes huge amounts of water. Flash floods, for example, can wreak havoc on villages, agricultural areas, and infrastructure. To find out more about such events, the Heidelberg researchers studied a glacial lake outburst flood in Ladakh that destroyed houses, fields, and bridges in the village of Gya in August of 2014. Studies of the glacial lake, which is situated at 5,300 m above sea level, revealed a drastic short-tem lake level rise prior to the GLOF.The cause, as the scientists discovered, was a ""previously little-known mechanism."" ""Increased glacial melting caused the lake level to rise quite rapidly. Instead of resulting in spillover, however, the thawing ice cores in the moraine, i.e. the glacier's debris field, drained through subsurface tunnels without disturbing the moraine's surface,"" states Nüsser. In addition to conducting field surveys, the scientists also interviewed the locals about their recollections of the GLOF event. On the basis of satellite images, the team additionally studied the evolution of the glacial lake since the 1960s in order to reconstruct possible GLOF events.""The high temporal and high spatial remote sensing imagery from satellites supported by field surveys will allow us to better assess the possible risk of future outbursts in this region,"" adds the Heidelberg geographer. In light of recurring GLOFs, the new inventory can help us ""re-evaluate the hazards, identify vulnerable locations, and develop possible adaptation measures,"" continues Nüsser.

That's because the method's byproducts include the building blocks for synthesizing methane, ethanol and other carbon-based compounds used in industrial processing.The team tapped a novel energy source from the nanoworld to trigger a run-of-the-mill chemical reaction that eliminates carbon dioxide. In this reaction, solid carbon latches onto one of the oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide gas, reducing it to carbon monoxide. The conversion normally requires significant amounts of energy in the form of high heat -- a temperature of at least 700 degrees Celsius, hot enough to melt aluminum at normal atmospheric pressure.Instead of heat, the team relied on the energy harvested from traveling waves of electrons, known as localized surface plasmons (LSPs), which surf on individual aluminum nanoparticles. The team triggered the LSP oscillations by exciting the nanoparticles with an electron beam that had an adjustable diameter. A narrow beam, about a nanometer in diameter, bombarded individual aluminum nanoparticles while a beam about a thousand times wider generated LSPs among a large set of the nanoparticles.In the team's experiment, the aluminum nanoparticles were deposited on a layer of graphite, a form of carbon. This allowed the nanoparticles to transfer the LSP energy to the graphite. In the presence of carbon dioxide gas, which the team injected into the system, the graphite served the role of plucking individual oxygen atoms from carbon dioxide, reducing it to carbon monoxide. The aluminum nanoparticles were kept at room temperature. In this way, the team accomplished a major feat: getting rid of the carbon dioxide without the need for a source of high heat.Previous methods of removing carbon dioxide have had limited success because the techniques have required high temperature or pressure, employed costly precious metals, or had poor efficiency. In contrast, the LSP method not only saves energy but uses aluminum, a cheap and abundant metal.Although the LSP reaction generates a poisonous gas -- carbon monoxide -- the gas readily combines with hydrogen to produce essential hydrocarbon compounds, such as methane and ethanol, that are often used in industry, said NIST researcher Renu Sharma.She and her colleagues, including scientists from the University of Maryland in College Park and DENSsolutions, in Delft, the Netherlands, reported their findings in ""We showed for the first time that this carbon dioxide reaction, which otherwise will only happen at 700 degrees C or higher, can be triggered using LSPs at room temperature,"" said researcher Canhui Wang of NIST and the University of Maryland.The researchers chose an electron beam to excite the LSPs because the beam can also be used to image structures in the system as small as a few billionths of a meter. This enabled the team to estimate how much carbon dioxide had been removed. They studied the system using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).Because both the concentration of carbon dioxide and the reaction volume of the experiment were so small, the team had to take special steps to directly measure the amount of carbon monoxide generated. They did so by coupling a specially modified gas cell holder from the TEM to a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, allowing the team to measure parts-per-millions concentrations of carbon dioxide.Sharma and her colleagues also used the images produced by the electron beam to measure the amount of graphite that was etched away during the experiment, a proxy for how much carbon dioxide had been taken away. They found that the ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide measured at the outlet of the gas cell holder increased linearly with the amount of carbon removed by etching.Imaging with the electron beam also confirmed that most of the carbon etching -- a proxy for carbon dioxide reduction -- occurred near the aluminum nanoparticles. Additional studies revealed that when the aluminum nanoparticles were absent from the experiment, only about one-seventh as much carbon was etched.Limited by the size of the electron beam, the team's experimental system was small, only about 15 to 20 nanometers across (the size of a small virus).To scale up the system so that it could remove carbon dioxide from the exhaust of a commercial power plant, a light beam may be a better choice than an electron beam to excite the LSPs, Wang said. Sharma proposes that a transparent enclosure containing loosely packed carbon and aluminum nanoparticles could be placed over the smokestack of a power plant. An array of light beams impinging upon the grid would activate the LSPs. When the exhaust passes through the device, the light-activated LSPs in the nanoparticles would provide the energy to remove carbon dioxide.The aluminum nanoparticles, which are commercially available, should be evenly distributed to maximize contact with the carbon source and the incoming carbon dioxide, the team noted.The new work also suggests that LSPs offer a way for a slew of other chemical reactions that now require a large infusion of energy to proceed at ordinary temperatures and pressures using plasmonic nanoparticles.""Carbon dioxide reduction is a big deal, but it would be an even bigger deal, saving enormous amounts of energy, if we can start to do many chemical reactions at room temperature that now require heating,"" Sharma said.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have discovered a new way of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using light-activated nanoparticles.

The results show that if 80 percent of new residential buildings in Europe were made of wood, and wood were used in the structures, cladding, surfaces, and furnishings of houses, all together the buildings would store 55 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

So far, they are strongly focused on how energy is consumed during use,' Amiri says.In terms of wood products, a wooden building provides longer-term storage for carbon than pulp or paper. According to the study findings, a wooden building of 100 m'Wood construction is sustainable only if the wood comes from forests that are grown in a sustainable manner.

The resources of the in-country volcano monitoring institute are small and the team has an incredible workload, but they really helped us make the links with the community living on Manam island.""Following the fieldwork, the researchers raised funds to buy computers, solar panels and other technology to enable the local community -- who have since put together a disaster preparedness group -- to communicate via satellite from the island, and to provide drone operations training to Rabaul Volcanological Observatory staff to assist in their monitoring efforts.ABOVE was part of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), a global community of scientists on a ten-year quest to understand more about carbon in Earth.Volcanic emissions are a critical stage of the Earth's carbon cycle -- the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and ocean -- but COUnderstanding the factors that control volcanic carbon emissions in the present day will reveal how the climate has changed in the past and therefore how it may respond in the future to current human impacts.Co-author Professor Alessandro Aiuppa (University of Palermo) described the findings as 'a real advance in our field', adding: ""Ten years ago you could have only stared and guessed what Manam's CO""If you take into account all the carbon released by global volcanism, it's less than a per cent of the total emission budget, which is dominated by human activity.

An international research team recently completed an investigation to see how these changes are affecting the food webs and fish communities of lakes in northern Finland. Biomasses and omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, were determined from the algal producers at the base of food web to large carnivorous fish from 20 lakes along a pronounced climatic and productivity gradient. Increasing nutrient load and rising temperature shift food webs towards murky water adapted communities.","The team measured amount of fish and invertebrates from 20 subarctic lakes along climate and productivity gradient and determined the nutritional quality of organisms in each lake by measuring valuable omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, from primary producer algae communities to top predators.Researchers found major differences in the clear and murky water communities.

But is there any way we can detect if these changes are occurring at an abnormal rate? What are the consequences of these changes for the organisms affected? An international team of researchers including scientists from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) have developed a method of detecting such developments and tracking how new ecosystems are formed. They have published their findings in the specialist journal,"Changes in the environment are becoming increasingly apparent due to climate change. Temperatures are rising, there is either no rain at all or it falls in severe storms. These changes have an effect on ecosystems and the living conditions of the organisms within them. If the conditions within these ecosystems become too unfavourable for individual organisms, they either migrate or even become extinct. At the same time, new ecological niches arise that other species can populate or new species are created. 'The problem is knowing at which point we can say it's a new ecosystem,' explains Prof. Wolfgang Kießling from the Chair of Palaeoenvironmental Research at FAU. 'We have now developed a method that allows us to distinguish such events from normal background noise.'An ecosystem is considered new by scientists if extremely rapid changes in the range of organisms within it lead to a state that previously did not exist. The speed at which the changes occur is extremely important. Ecosystems are always changing to a certain extent. Significant shifts only occur above a certain limit, for example as caused by human-made climate change. Scientists are now able to precisely determine this limit using statistics.Times of increased change are extremely dynamic and pose special challenges for the species involved. Wolfgang Kießling and his colleagues successfully tested their method on fossil ecosystems from a period ranging over 66 million years and their results are alarming. The risk of extinction during such dynamic periods of change is twice to four times higher than under normal conditions. At the same time, however, there is a greater chance that new species migrate or are created. 'Changes have always occurred in ecosystems and they will continue to do so,' Kießling continues. 'In terms of protecting the environment, it's therefore important not to prevent changes in general, but to try and steer them in a direction that does not have an increased risk of extinction.'",Climate,2020.0,"Climate change is causing significant changes in ecosystems, leading to rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions.

The study highlights how challenge and collapse in some areas were matched by resilience and opportunities elsewhere.The findings published today in ""The study shows the end of the Early Bronze Age occupation at Tayinat was a long and drawn out affair that, while it appears to coincide with the onset of a megadrought 4,200 years ago, was actually the culmination of processes that began much earlier,"" says Tim Harrison, professor and chair of the Department of Near & Middle Eastern Civilizations in the Faculty of Arts & Science at the University of Toronto (U of T), and director of the Tayinat Archaeological Project. ""The archaeological evidence does not point towards significant local effects of the climate episode, as there is no evidence of drought stress in crops.""""Instead, these changes were more likely the result of local political and spatial reconfiguration.""The mid-to late Early Bronze Age (3000-2000 BCE) and the Late Bronze Age (1600-1200 BCE) in the ancient Middle East are pivotal periods of early inter-connectedness among settlements across the region, with the development of some of the earliest cities and state-level societies. But these systems were not always sustainable, and both periods ended in collapse of civilisations/settlements, the reasons for which are highly debated.The absence of detailed timelines for societal activity throughout the region leaves a significant gap in understanding the associations between climate change and social responses. While the disintegration of political or economic systems are indeed components of a societal response, collapse is rarely total.Using radiocarbon dating and analysis of archaeological samples recovered from Tell Tayinat, a location occupied following two particularly notable climate change episodes 4,200 and again 3,200 years ago, the Toronto-Cornell team established a robust chronological timeframe for Tayinat for these two pivotal periods in the history of the ancient Middle East.""The absolute dating of these periods has been a subject of considerable debate for many years, and this study contributes a significant new dataset that helps address many of the questions,"" says Sturt Manning, Goldwin Smith Professor of Classical Archaeology in the Department of Classics at Cornell University's College of Arts & Sciences, and lead author of the study.""The detailed chronological resolution achieved in this study allows for a more substantive interpretation of the archaeological evidence in terms of local and regional responses to proposed climate change, shedding light on how humans respond to environmental stress and variability.""The researchers say the chronological framework for the Early Iron Age demonstrates the thriving re-settlement of Tayinat following the 3,200 years ago event during a reconstructed period of heightened aridity.""The settlement of Tayinat may have been undertaken to maximize access to arable land, and crop evidence reveals the continued cultivation of numerous water-demanding crops, revealing a response that counters the picture of a drought-stricken region,"" says Harrison.

The findings were published in ""When I saw the satellite measurement of the smoke plume at 35 kilometres, it was jaw dropping. I never would have expected that,"" said Adam Bourassa, professor of physics and engineering physics, who led the USask group which played a key role in analyzing NASA satellite data.Prior to Australia's ""Black Summer,"" which burned 5.8 million hectares of forest in the southeast part of that continent, the smoke cloud caused by the 2017 forest fires in Western Canada was the largest on record.The international team was led by Sergey Khaykin from LATMOS (Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales) in France. Bourassa said the team's findings provide critical information for understanding how wildfires are impacting the Earth's atmosphere.""We're seeing records broken in terms of the impact on the atmosphere from these fires,"" said Bourassa. ""Knowing that they're likely to strike more frequently and with more intensity due to climate change, we could end up with a pretty dramatically changed atmosphere."" Bourassa, his post-doctoral student Landon Rieger, and research engineer Daniel Zawada were the only Canadians involved in the project. Bourassa's group has expertise in a specific type of satellite measurement that is very sensitive to smoke in the upper atmosphere. Their contributions were funded in part by the Canadian Space Agency. According to Bourassa, wildfires such as those in Australia and Western Canada get big enough and hot enough that they generate their own thunderstorms, called Pyrocumulonimbus. These, in turn, create powerful updrafts that push smoke and the surrounding air up past the altitudes where jets fly, into the upper part of the atmosphere called the stratosphere.""What was also really amazing was that as the smoke sits in the atmosphere, it starts to absorb sunlight and so it starts to heat up,"" said Bourassa. ""And then, because it's getting hotter, it starts to rise in a swirling vortex 'bubble', and it just rose and rose higher and higher through the atmosphere.""Information collected by satellite, using an instrument called a spectrometer, showed smoke from the Australian wildfires blocked sunlight from reaching Earth to an extent never before recorded from wildfires.The measurement technique, proven by Canadian scientists including Bourassa over a decade ago, measures the sunlight scattered from the atmosphere back to the satellite, generating a detailed, image of layers in the atmosphere.The stratosphere is typically a ""pretty pristine, naturally clean, stable part of atmosphere,"" Bourassa said. However, when aerosols -- such as smoke from wildfires or sulphuric acid from a volcanic eruption -- are forced up into the stratosphere, they can remain aloft for many months, blocking sunlight from passing through, which in turns changes the balance of the climate system.While researchers have a general understanding of how these smoke clouds form and why they rise high into the stratosphere, Bourassa said more work needs to be done to understand the underlying mechanisms.Researchers will also be comparing their findings from Australian wildfires with satellite data captured from California wildfires this past summer and fall.",Climate,2020.0,"A smoke cloud caused by forest fires in Western Canada in 2017 was the largest on record before Australia's ""Black Summer"" burned 5.8 million hectares of forest in the southeast part of that continent.

""Sulfur can also contribute to fine particulate matter in the air we breathe, which can be more severe than the sulfur dioxide itself.""Exposure to particulate matter was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths and more than 100 million disability-adjusted life years -- which measures years lost due to illness, disability or death -- according to the Lancet Global Burden of Diseases Study, published in 2015.According to Wang, current desulfurization methods can successfully remove sulfur dioxide from tail gas streams but not without significant drawbacks.Flue gas desulfurization technologies, for example, are the most used methods to capture sulfur dioxide, but these processes create a large amount of solid waste in the form of metal sulfate that requires disposal. Furthermore, these processes produce wastewater that requires additional treatment, making the overall method costly and environmentally unfriendly.Alternatively, sulfur dioxide can be reduced to solid elemental sulfur through catalysis -- a chemical reaction brought on by a catalyst and usually a reducing agent such as hydrogen, methane, or carbon monoxide -- and then used as a raw material for such things as fertilizer. However, high temperatures are normally needed in the traditional catalytic process to attain high conversion levels. This is not ideal because it uses a great deal of energy and there is a loss of catalyst activity, according to the scientists.Due to these flaws, Wang and his colleagues tested a novel technology, a one-step, low-temperature plasma-assisted catalytic process that eliminates the need for high temperatures and creates far less waste than FGD technologies.To test this process, the team loaded an iron sulfide catalyst into a packed bed reactor. Then they introduced the hydrogen and the sulfur dioxide gas mixtures, which passed through the catalyst bed at roughly 300 degrees Fahrenheit. They then turned on the nonthermal plasma and the reactions immediately began to occur.Once the process completed, they analyzed the samples to see how much sulfur dioxide was in the gas and how much hydrogen was consumed. They also collected and analyzed the solid sulfur, which accumulates at the bottom of the reactor. They published their results in ACS Catalysis and a recent issue of the ""The temperature we used, 150 degrees C (about 300 degrees F), is higher than the sulfur melt point to avoid sulfur deposition over the catalyst,"" Wang said. ""Through this process, the catalyst shows very excellent stability. When run for several hours, we do not see any deactivation. The activity and the selectivity stay the same.""The researchers also found that this process dramatically promoted sulfur dioxide reduction at low temperatures, enhancing conversion by 148% to 200 percent and 87 to 120 percent using hydrogen and methane, respectively.Sean Knecht, assistant teaching professor in the School of Engineering Design, Technology and Professional Programs, said that NTP works because highly energetic electrons interact with gas molecules to produce reactive species -- radicals, ions and excited molecules -- enabling various chemical reactions at low temperature.""The result is that the electrons are able to initiate what would appear to be thermodynamically-unfavorable chemical reactions through dissociation and excitation of reactants at much lower temperatures than thermal catalysis,"" Knecht said. ""If these reactions can be undertaken at much lower temperatures than are typical for thermal catalysis, as we have shown, then the power input to future systems is significantly reduced, which is a big deal.""Wang added that using plasma allows them to achieve optimal performance using just 10 watts of electricity. Another advantage is that renewable energy, such as wind or solar, can be easily applied to this process to supply power to the plasma.The researchers now want to better understand exactly how the plasma contributes to the catalysis process and seek to develop an even more effective catalyst for the process.""A current challenge that we are working to address is further isolating the effects of the plasma versus effects of the catalyst and the synergistic aspects,"" Knecht said. ""We are looking at some surface spectroscopy options presently and at some point, combining with computational modeling. Bringing these together can provide a more holistic understanding of the physics and chemistry at play.""If the process is commercializable, it has the potential to largely replace the current FDG technologies.""It's highly beneficial to energy and the environment,"" Wang said. ""Our process saves energy, reduces waste and saves water. This is very transformational.""Other contributing researchers included Mohammad S. AlQahtani, graduate student; Chunshan Song, distinguished professor emeritus at Penn State and dean of faculty of science and Wei Lun Professor of Chemistry at The Chinese University of Hong Kong; Sven G.

Those working to understand and protect coral reefs are building the know-how to mitigate the damage but doing so requires first knowing where reefs are located.,"Many approaches, such as diver-based observation and satellite imagery, have been used to estimate the distribution of coral reefs around the world, but past approaches have led to inconsistent accuracy because the underlying data are derived from disparate sources and varying methodologies. Now, researchers from the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science (GDCS) have generated a global coral reef extent map using a single methodology capable of predicting the location of shallow coral reefs with nearly 90% accuracy.The GDCS team used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an advanced artificial intelligence approach, along with thousands of satellite images from Planet Inc. to create the new global map. Planet's satellites obtain daily coverage of the Earth's landmass and its coral reefs at a 3.7-meter resolution. Many of these satellites are as small as a loaf of bread but, operating together, they collect over 11 terabytes of data every day. This continuous stream of imagery yields a massive amount of data -- too much for even a large team of scientists to manually sort through. Using convolutional neural networks and ASU's supercomputer, the GDCS team was able to analyze the data and extract the locations of shallow reefs less than 20 meters (70 feet) of water depth worldwide.The maps are openly available through the Allen Coral Atlas, a collaborative partnership between ASU, Vulcan Inc., Planet Inc., University of Queensland, and National Geographic Society to map and monitor the world's coral reefs in unprecedented detail.""The new map represents our best estimate of the location of shallow coral reefs on the planet, and it guides next steps including our ongoing collaboration to map the composition of these reefs and their changing health over time,"" said first author, Jiwei Li, of GDCS.The researchers indicated that these new maps can be used with other global maps or datasets to create derived data or analytic products. Some immediate uses of the map at the Allen Coral Atlas include determining where to monitor for coral bleaching, a global phenomenon driven by ocean warming.Greg Asner, co-author of the study and ASU's Allen Coral Atlas lead explained, ""This first-ever A.I.-driven map of the world's coral reefs is just a drop in the bucket compared to what we have coming out over the next year and beyond. The partnership is already rolling out much more detailed reef composition maps on a region by region basis, and we are preparing to launch a global reef monitoring system that detects bleaching.

Due to rising temperatures and longer dry periods, two plant species have already gone extinct over the last 40 years. The populations of many others have decreased by one third. In the next couple of decades ten more species could become extinct, researchers from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) write in ","There are only a few healthy ombrotrophic bogs, raised bogs and spring mires left in Germany. They used to cover large swathes of north-western Germany. Today they are still found in the foothills of the Alps and on low mountain ranges, for example in the Black Forest. They are very sensitive ecosystems that are highly dependent on certain climatic conditions. ""These bogs and spring mires are seismographs of climate change. They react very sensitively to small changes in precipitation and temperature,"" says professor Helge Bruelheide, a geobotanist at MLU and co-director of iDiv. Bog complexes also have a very high proportion of endangered plant and animal species.Bruelheide joined forces with Thomas Sperle, a biologist and wetlands expert, to investigate the trends in biodiversity in bogs and spring mires in the southern region of the Black Forest. The two scientists drew on data from the 1970s about the vegetation of 124 complete bogs. Sperle completely re-surveyed nearly all of the areas over a period of four years. ""It is really tricky to prove the extinction of a species for an entire bog. I had to carefully scan the whole area to ensure that specific individuals were not overlooked,"" says Sperle. Bruelheide then used the data to analyse the 88 plant species. Two species have already become extinct. The population size of another 37 have decreased by about one third since the 1970s. This has disproportionately affected so-called specialist species that are adapted to specific climatic conditions and make up a large portion of the biodiversity in Germany. However, there were also 46 so-called generalist species that have coped better with the changes and whose numbers have increased over time.The researchers also checked whether their observations could be explained by other factors, such as the size of the bogs, the distance from one bog to another and whether adjacent areas were used for agriculture. However, no factor could explain the data better than climate change. ""Our analyses clearly show that species are declining and dying out in places where it is drier and warmer for longer periods of time in the summer. This is the first indication that climate change has already arrived in our latitudes,"" concludes Bruelheide. ""It is getting noticeably drier and hotter in the Black Forest, which is why this change is evident there. Presumably, the same thing will happen in other low mountain ranges such as the Harz. Our study can serve as an example for other regions in Germany, but also for other habitats and groups of species.""In their study, the biologists predict that ten more specialist species will disappear by 2045 if conditions progress as expected. This is an alarming sign as there is no way to counteract this extinction in raised bogs and spring moors.

These changes to the ice sheet could have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and communities, as the flow of water under the ice sheet as well as nutrient and sediment flow are altered. Results of the research were published on October 27 in the American Geophysical Union's ","""The speed of ice loss in Greenland is stunning,"" said Moon. ""We can now see many signs of a transformed landscape from space. And as the ice sheet edge responds to rapid ice loss, the character and behavior of the system as a whole is changing, with the potential to influence ecosystems and people who depend on them.""The researchers compiled data from NASA, the United States Geological Survey, and other satellites from 1985 to 2015 to compare ice edge position, ice sheet surface elevation, and glacier flow over three decades. Advancements in satellite technology allowed them to observe the changes to the ice sheet in much greater detail than was possible in the past. Much of the data used was from the NASA Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project, which facilitates ice sheet, ice shelf, and glacier research by providing a global record of land ice velocity and elevation derived from nearly three decades of satellite observations.Using these comparisons, the researchers developed a few key findings. The most consistent trend, found across the entire ice sheet, is widespread ice edge retreat. While there is a range of behavior among glaciers across the ice sheet, there is a noticeable lack of sustained ocean-connected glacier advance. Out of 225 ocean-connected glaciers that were measured, none have substantially advanced while 200 have retreated, particularly since 2000. This is notable even in regions dominated by slower-moving glaciers and cooler ocean water, such as the northern and northeastern regions of the ice sheet. In addition, while the vast majority of glaciers are retreating, ice flow response on those glaciers, such as speeding up or slowing down, is affected in large part by topography and upstream factors. This includes the slope of the landscape and the presence and shape of bedrock and sediments underneath the glacier. Therefore, even glaciers within the same regional or local area can behave differently.As the researchers examined changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet, they found that zones of fast glacier flow are narrowing, ice is being rerouted, and in some cases, the flow of new ice to glaciers is slowed, stranding glaciers in place. These processes could have a variety of downstream impacts, such as altering how water moves under the ice sheet, which could affect the availability of water to communities and animals, altering where nutrients and sediment enter the ocean, exposing new land areas, opening new fjord waters, and altering ecosystems and physical landscapes.""As the Arctic ocean and atmosphere warm, we can clearly see the flow of ice into the ocean accelerate and the ice edge retreat,"" said Alex Gardner, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and co-author of the study. ""When we look more closely, however, we can see the complexity of how individual glaciers respond, owing to differences in the properties of the ocean water that reach the glacier front, the bedrock and till that lie below, and in how meltwater runoff is routed beneath. Understanding the complexity of individual glacier response is critical to improving projections of ice sheet change and the associated sea level rise that will arrive at our shores.""",Climate,2020.0,"Greenland's ice sheet is losing ice at an alarming rate, according to a new study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

A new study now quantifies this feedback by exploring long-term if-then-scenarios. If the Arctic summer sea-ice were to melt completely, a scenario that is likely to become reality at least temporarily within this century with ongoing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, this could eventually add roughly 0.2°C to global warming. It is, however, not in addition to IPCC projections of future warming since these already take the relevant mechanisms into account. Still, the scientists could now separate the effects of the ice loss from other effects and quantify it.","The 0.2°C are substantial, given that global mean temperature is currently about one degree higher than in pre-industrial times, and governments worldwide agreed to stop the increase well below two degrees.""If global ice masses shrink, this changes how much of the sunlight that hits Earth's surface is reflected back into space. Decreasing ice cover in the Arctic exposes more of the darker ocean water that absorbs more energy,"" says Nico Wunderling, lead author of the study. ""This is referred to as albedo feedback. It's like wearing white or black clothes in summer. If you wear dark, you heat up more easily."" Further factors include for instance the increase of water vapour in the atmosphere due to the warming if more ice is melting. Warmer air can hold more water vapour, and water vapour increases the greenhouse effect. The basic mechanisms are well-known since long, but the Potsdam scientists were able to actually calculate the overall amount of warming that can be triggered by global ice loss.""This is not a short-term risk. Earth's ice masses are huge, which makes them very important for our Earth system as a whole -- it also means that their response to anthropogenic climate change, especially that of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica, unfolds on longer timescales. But even if some of the changes might take hundreds or thousands of years to manifest, it's possible we trigger them within just a couple of decades,"" says Ricarda Winkelmann who leads the research group.The scientists did comprehensive computer simulations. The effects are not always straightforward: for instance, if a massive ice cover on land is shrinking, there can still be snow -- which still reflects the sunlight, just like the ice did. This is why, if the mountain glaciers and the ice on Greenland and West Antarctica would all disappear, the additional warming directly caused by the ice loss would likely be just an additional 0.2 degrees on top of the 0.2 degrees due to Arctic summer sea-ice melting. ""Yet every tenth of a degree of warming counts for our climate,"" says Winkelmann. ""Preventing Earth system feedback loops, or vicious circles, is thus more urgent than ever.""",Climate,2020.0,"Melting ice from Greenland and Antarctica could cause global temperatures to rise by 0.4°C, twice the amount previously estimated, according to research by Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

In these cases, the shoreline will retreat, but the beaches are still likely to remain, albeit a little raised in elevation and located landward, and will certainly not go 'extinct'.The new paper says there is currently no information available globally on the number of beaches which fall into either category and, as such, it is impossible to quantify what proportion of the world's beaches will disappear between now and 2100.Andrew Cooper, Professor of Coastal Studies at Ulster University and the new paper's lead author, said: ""New methods are needed for predicting impacts of sea-level rise on the coast. This will require better datasets of coastal morphology and improved understanding of the mechanisms of shoreline response in given settings. As sea level rises, shoreline retreat must, and will, happen but beaches will survive. The biggest threat to the continued existence of beaches is coastal defence structures that limit their ability to migrate.""Co-author Professor Gerd Masselink, from the University of Plymouth's Coastal Processes Research Group, led a study earlier this year which found that island 'drowning' is not inevitable as sea levels rise.He added: ""Sea level is currently rising and will continue to rise at an increasing rate for many years to come. This will lead to more coastal erosion and it is crucial that we anticipate the future loss of land and take this into account in coastal management and planning to avoid putting more buildings and coastal infrastructure in harm's way. In the UK, Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMAs) are becoming increasingly important as a planning tool. CCMAs are areas that are likely to be affected by coastal change in the future and development in these areas should be avoided. This will then enable the coastline to respond naturally to sea-level rise, preventing coastal squeeze and loss of beaches.""Coastal structures such as seawalls prevent beaches from naturally adjusting to rising sea levels by migrating landward and in those settings, removal of the structures (managed realignment) or nature-based solutions (beach nourishment) may be the only methods to safeguard the future of these beaches.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has disputed the claim that half the world's beaches could disappear by the end of the century due to climate change. Researchers from the UK, France, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the US have criticised a previous paper which predicted the loss of 50% of beaches, stating that it is impossible to make such global predictions using current data and numerical methods. The researchers did agree that beaches backed by hard coastal cliffs and engineering structures are likely to disappear, but said that those backed by low-lying coastal plains, shallow lagoons, salt marshes and dunes will migrate landward.",,

This means that at the current global emission of 36 gigatons per year, there is a 35-year window to reduce our emissions to zero.One way to achieve this goal is to change the way energy is produced and consumed.""Our vision is solar photovoltaics can play a central role in a transformed sustainable energy economy with 100% decarbonized electricity generation to power directly or indirectly -- through the production of green hydrogen or other synthetic fuels -- all energy sectors and industrial processes,"" said Verlinden.The world will require, in addition to other renewable energy sources like wind and hydro, about 70 to 80 terawatts of cumulative capacity from solar photovoltaic systems. This represents more than 100 times the world's current solar photovoltaic installed capacity.""Within the next 10 years, the industry needs to increase its production rate by a factor of about 30,"" he said.A model developed by Verlinden and colleagues to predict the efficiency of solar cells and their cost to manufacture during the next few decades shows there ""is no fundamental barrier to achieving this goal,"" he said.The financial requirement to grow the production rate (capital expenditures to build new production lines) is decreasing at a rate of 18% per year, driven by productivity improvements and a combination of higher-throughput per tool, larger wafers, and improved cell efficiency.""In terms of material sustainability, the only major issue is the use of silver for metallization of silicon solar cells,"" said Verlinden.

At that time, the atmosphere was essentially flooded by the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, with concentration levels reaching 1,400 ppm to 4,000 ppm. So it's not hard to imagine that temperatures on Earth must have resembled those of a sauna. It was hot and humid, and the ice on the polar caps had completely disappeared.","The climate in that era provides researchers with an indication as to how today's climate might develop. While pre-industrial levels of atmospheric COUsing tiny siderite minerals in soil samples taken from former swamps, a group of researchers from ETH Zurich, Pennsylvania State University and CASP in Cambridge (UK) reconstructed the climate that prevailed at the end of the Paleocene and in the early Eocene. Their study has just been published in the journal The siderite minerals formed in an oxygen-free soil environment that developed under dense vegetation in swamps, which were abundant along the hot and humid coastlines in the Paleocene and Eocene.To reconstruct the climatic conditions from the equator to the polar regions, the researchers studied siderites from 13 different sites. These were all located in the northern hemisphere, covering all geographical latitudes from the tropics to the Arctic.""Our reconstruction of the climate based on the siderite samples shows that a hot atmosphere also comes with high levels of moisture,"" says lead author Joep van Dijk, who completed his doctorate in ETH Professor Stefano Bernasconi's group at the Geological Institute from 2015 to 2018.Accordingly, between 57 and 55 million years ago, the mean annual air temperature at the equator where Colombia lies today was around 41 °C. In Arctic Siberia, the average summer temperature was 23 °C.Using their siderite ""hygrometer,"" the researchers also demonstrated that the global moisture content in the atmosphere, or the specific humidity, was much higher in the Paleocene and Eocene eras than it is today. In addition, water vapour remained in the air for longer because specific humidity increased at a greater rate than evaporation and precipitation. However, the increase in specific humidity was not the same everywhere.Since they had access to siderite from all latitudes, the researchers were also able to study the spatial pattern of the specific humidity. They found that the tropics and higher latitudes would have had very high humidity levels.The researchers attribute this phenomenon to water vapour that was transported to these zones from the subtropics. Specific humidity rose the least in the subtropics. While evaporation increased, precipitation decreased. This resulted in a higher level of atmospheric water vapour, which ultimately reached the poles and the equator. And the atmospheric vapour carried heat along with it.Climate scientists still observe the flow of water vapour and heat from the subtropics to the tropics today. ""Latent heat transport was likely to have been even greater during the Eocene,"" van Dijk says. ""And the increase in the transport of heat to high latitudes may well have been conducive to the intensification of warming in the polar regions,"" he adds.These new findings suggest that today's global warming goes hand in hand with increased transport of moisture, and by extension heat, in the atmosphere. ""Atmospheric moisture transport is a key process that reinforces warming of the polar regions,"" van Dijk explains.""Although the COFinding the siderites was not easy. For one thing, the minerals are tiny, plus they occur solely in fossil swamps, which today are often found only several kilometres below the Earth's surface. This made it difficult or even impossible for the researchers to dig up siderites themselves. ""We made several expeditions to sites where we believed siderites might occur but we found them at only one of those locations,"" van Dijk says.Fortunately, one of the study's co-authors -- Tim White, an American from Pennsylvania State University -- owns the world's largest collection of siderite.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers from ETH Zurich, Pennsylvania State University and CASP in Cambridge have reconstructed the climate that existed at the end of the Paleocene and in the early Eocene by studying tiny siderite minerals in soil samples taken from former swamps.

Analyzing data from the last 24 years, the main reason for this appears to be changes in food quality. The type of phytoplankton that is available for blue mussels to eat can in turn be linked to our changing climate.","Blue mussels in the Baltic Sea are already small in their nature -- the length of the mussels is about the length of a nail to the mere eye. In this study, the researchers discovered that blue mussels are now weighing around half of what they used to weigh in the 90's, despite the mean length difference just being a few millimeters. But on the other hand there are now more mussels that are really tiny, sometimes as many as 1000 in one square meter compared to about 500 per square meter before.Mussels compose the largest biomass of animals without a backbone in the Baltic, providing food to eider ducks and fish, for example. But because they are getting 'smaller' it means less food for the species feeding on them. It is also estimated that all blue mussels in the Baltic, together filter the entire waters of Baltic sea every year -- and this is essential for cleaning the water from particles and helping to combat eutrophication -- one of the Baltics biggest threats. Since the mussel size is affected it might therefore have effects on filtration rates, although this was not tested in this particular study:""Even though an increase in the number of mussels to some extent may compensate for the smaller size, it is likely that important functions like filtration of the water has been reduced, which could lead to more turbid water"" says Agnes Karlsson, Assistant Professor at Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences (DEEP) at Stockholm University.The reason for the mussels getting smaller is likely altered mix of phytoplankton, now with greater quantities of cyanobacteria and particles from land. Warmer waters favour cyanobacteria, in turn causing increased summer blooms. Yet, the study found no direct role of increasing temperature for the decrease in mussel size. This means that indirect effects of climate change might be more important for mussels. The study is based on continuously monitored and collected samples of both mussels and phytoplankton from 1993 to 2016:""We want to call attention to the benefits of long-term monitoring. If not for monitoring, we wouldn't have known that this key species for the Baltic is on a slippery slope,"" says Agnes Karlsson, Assistant Professor at Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences (DEEP) at Stockholm University.The study highlights the importance of keeping an eagle eye perspective when considering how environmental changes affect key-organism in the long-run:""There is often multiple and interacting factors responsible for changes in an organisms' condition or population and all of this likely affects the entire ecosystem functioning"" says Camilla Liénart, postdoc at Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences (DEEP) at Stockholm University.",Climate,2020.0,"Blue mussels in the Baltic Sea have decreased in weight by half since the 1990s, according to a study from Stockholm University.

An international team of researchers, including from the University of Bonn, is now advocating effective use of this potential. Experts estimate that this could reduce the increase of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by a third. At the same time, agricultural yields in many regions would also increase significantly. In a recent publication they present a strategy to achieve these goals. The study is published in the journal ","The climate summit in Paris in 2015 was also the birth of the so-called ""4 per 1,000"" initiative. Its name stands for a link that has not received enough attention in climate research and politics for a long time: Every year the amount of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than four billion tons due to the human-made greenhouse gas COExperts are indeed confident today that this strategy could significantly slow down climate change. ""0.4 percent additional carbon input is somewhat too optimistic,"" explains Prof. Wulf Amelung, who heads the Division of Soil Science at the University of Bonn. ""However, a third of this is probably achievable."" Nevertheless, little has changed since 2015. Together with colleagues from Europe, the USA, Australia and China, Amelung and colleagues therefore want to put the issue back on the agenda. In the current issue of the journal There are a number of simple measures to increase the amount of carbon in the soil, such as mulching (i.e. covering the soil with crop residues) or adding plant-based coal. The most important method, however, is to increase plant growth (and thus crop yields): by liming acidic soils, by fertilizing as needed, by using smart irrigation. ""The more grows on the soil, the better is it rooted,"" explains Amelung. ""And roots with their widely branching networks of organic material store lots of carbon."" Conversely, the organic matter contains essential nutrients for plant growth and thus promotes crop yield. ""Our strategy therefore ultimately addresses two important goals: climate protection and food security.""However, the global implementation of this ambitious plan is not quite so simple: The quality and characteristics of soils in different locations are too different, and the available management technologies are too dissimilar. ""Increasing the carbon input therefore requires locally adapted measures; we need completely different strategies in the rice-growing regions of Asia than, for example, on a cereal field in northern Germany,"" Amelung emphasizes. In addition, many carbon sequestration measures are particularly effective when soils are partially degraded by long-term overuse and have lost a lot of carbon. ""From a cost-benefit perspective, it certainly makes the most sense to start on such areas, not least because the yield increases are likely to be greatest there,"" explains the soil expert.Unfortunately, however, knowledge about the condition of soil is very patchy. The researchers therefore recommend the establishment of databases that record the condition of land around the globe on a very small scale, as well as an equally small-scale modeling of possible yield gains and the necessary use of fertilizers. It must furthermore be ensured that there is no mere redistribution of carbon inputs: for example, organic material is moved from one farm to another at great expense and is now missing at its place of origin.",Climate,2020.0,"The ""4 per 1,000"" initiative, launched at the 2015 Paris climate summit, aims to increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil by 0.4% per year to mitigate climate change. While some experts believe this target is too optimistic, researchers suggest that a third of it is achievable through measures such as mulching, adding plant-based coal and increasing plant growth through liming acidic soils, fertilising and smart irrigation. The strategy would also improve crop yields and food security. However, the implementation of locally adapted measures is needed to address the varying quality and characteristics of soils in different locations.",,

So say researchers, who are increasingly proving this to be true.","Case in point: A new study by UC Santa Barbara's Andy MacDonald found that improving healthcare in rural Indonesia reduced incentives for illegal logging in a nearby national park, averting millions of dollars' worth of atmospheric carbon emissions.The analysis, published in the ""The results illustrate a strong link between human health and conservation in tropical forests in the developing world,"" said MacDonald, an assistant researcher at the Earth Research Institute who coauthored the study with UC Santa Barbara's David Lopez-Carr and colleagues at Stanford University, North Carolina State University Raleigh, Oregon Health and Science University, Natural Capital Advisors, and two NGOs involved in the intervention.The Indonesian clinic accepts barter as payment and gives discounts to villages based on community-wide reductions in logging. Given its success, it could provide a blueprint for preserving the world's biodiverse carbon sinks while reducing poverty and illness.""This innovative model has clear global health implications,"" said coauthor Michele Barry, senior associate dean of global health at Stanford and director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health. ""Health and climate can and should be addressed in unison, and done in coordination with and respect for local communities.""Every second, more than 100 trees disappear from tropical forests around the world. These forests, some of the world's most important carbon reservoirs, are crucial to slowing climate change and mass extinction.The current paradigm for conserving tropical forests -- establishing protected areas -- often excludes and disenfranchises local communities. This failure to address people's needs can lead communities with few economic alternatives to illegally log and convert the land. Lack of access to high-quality, affordable healthcare can compound the problem by perpetuating cycles of poor health and expanding out-of-pocket costs.With this in mind, the nonprofit organizations Alam Sehat Lestari and Health In Harmony in 2007 established a healthcare clinic adjacent to Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, with the support of the local government. The clinic was able to serve thousands of patients by accepting a range of alternative payments, such as tree seedlings, handicrafts and labor -- an approach that was created in collaboration with the communities themselves.Through agreements with most of the region's district leaders, the clinic also provided discounts to villages that could show evidence of reductions in illegal logging. Between 1985 and 2001, this region had lost 60% of its forest to this activity. In addition to affordable health care, the intervention provided training in sustainable, organic agriculture and a chainsaw buyback program.Researchers worked with the two non-profits to analyze more than 10 years of the clinic's patient health records, coupled with satellite observations of forest cover over that time. ""Private foundations funded the interventions, but it's innovative new programs at Stanford and the University of California that are funding the research,"" MacDonald said.The medical care led to a significant decline in a range of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and diabetes. At the same time, satellite images of the national park showed a 70% reduction in deforestation, compared to forest loss at control sites, an amount equivalent to more than 6,770 acres of rainforest.""We didn't know what to expect when we started evaluating the program's health and conservation impacts, but we were continually amazed that the data suggested such a strong link between improvements in healthcare access and tropical forest conservation,"" said lead author Isabel Jones, who recently earned her doctorate in biology at Stanford. Looking more closely at community-level logging rates, the researchers found that the greatest drop-offs in logging occurred adjacent to villages with the highest rates of clinic usage.""This is a case study of how to design, implement and evaluate a planetary health intervention that addresses human health and the health of rainforests on which our health depends,"" said coauthor Susanne Sokolow, a senior research scientist at Stanford.Globally, about 35% of protected areas are traditionally owned, managed, used or occupied by Indigenous and local communities. Yet the perspective and guidance of Indigenous peoples and local communities are rarely considered in the design of conservation and climate mitigation programs. By contrast, the Indonesian clinic's success grew out of the early and continued input of local communities who identified the mechanisms driving health and environmental problems as well as possible solutions.Such holistic approaches can have greater long-term effects by preserving and restoring the ecosystem services that protect human health. These include natural filtering processes that reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and shade-providing forest canopies that reduce ground temperature and heat-related illnesses.""The data support two important conclusions: human health is integral to the conservation of nature and vice versa, and we need to listen to the guidance of rainforest communities who know best how to live in balance with their forests,"" said Monica Nirmala, the executive director of the clinic from 2014 to 2018 and current board member of Health In Harmony.The clinic in West Kalimantan is still active, and the researchers are currently working on a follow-up project to see whether it and similar interventions in Indonesia have alleviated some of the shock from COVID-19 both on human health and deforestation.""We would expect illegal logging activity to respond to changes in timber market prices or loss of income associated with COVID-19,"" MacDonald said. ""We want to know whether the interventions buffered communities against these effects, as well as whether they increased the communities' resilience in terms of health and wellbeing.""Health in Harmony is also expanding to Madagascar and Brazil,"" he added, ""and we want to be able to robustly evaluate the impacts of their interventions there.""",Climate,2020.0,"Improving healthcare in rural Indonesia has reduced incentives for illegal logging in a nearby national park, according to a study by UC Santa Barbara's Andy MacDonald.

A new Stanford study reveals that while yields have increased overall -- likely due to new technologies and management approaches -- the staple crop has become significantly more sensitive to drought conditions. The research, published Oct. 26 in ","""The good news is that new technologies are really helping to raise yields, in all types of weather conditions,"" said study lead author David Lobell, the Gloria and Richard Kushel Director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment. ""The bad news is that these technologies, which include some specifically designed to withstand drought, are so helpful in good conditions that the cost of bad conditions are rising. So there's no sign yet that they will help reduce the cost of climate change.""Corn production in the U.S. is a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut. Despite concerns about resistant weeds, climate change and many other factors, the industry has set record yields in five of the last seven years. Likely drivers of these bumper crops include changes in planting and harvesting practices, such as adoption of drought-tolerant varieties, and changes in environmental conditions, such as reduced ozone levels and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that generally improve the water-use efficiency of crops.As climate change intensifies, however, the cost to maintain crop yields will likely increase.Using county soil maps and satellite-based yield estimates, among other data, the researchers examined fields in the Corn Belt, a nine-state region of the Midwest that accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. corn production. By comparing fields along gradients of drought stress each year, they could identify how sensitivity to drought is changing over time.Even within a single county, they found a wide range of soil moisture retention, with some soils able to hold twice as much water as others. As might be expected, there were generally higher yields for soils that held more water. They found yield sensitivity to soil water storage in the region increased by 55 percent on average between 1999 and 2018, with larger increases in drier states.The results made clear soil's ability to hold water was the primary reason for yield loss. In some cases, soil's ability to hold an increased amount of moisture was three times more effective at increasing yields than an equivalent increase in precipitation.So, why have yields become more sensitive to drought? A variety of factors, such as increased crop water needs due to increased plant sowing density may be at play. What is clear is that despite robust corn yields, the cost of drought and global demand for corn are rising simultaneously.To better understand how climate impacts to corn are evolving over time, the researchers call for increased access to field-level yield data that are measured independently of weather data, such as government insurance data that were previously available to the public but no longer are.""This study shows the power of satellite data, and if needed we can try to track things from space alone. That's exciting,"" Lobell said. ""But knowing if farmers are adapting well to climate stress, and which practices are most helpful, are key questions for our nation.

However, human activities are resulting in biodiversity loss and changes to ecosystems, which threatens the supply of key services. An international team of 32 scientists, from 22 institutions, led by Dr Maria Felipe-Lucia (UFZ, iDiv) and Prof Eric Allan (University of Bern) now present the very first assessment of the simultaneous effects of land-use intensity on biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services.","The researchers investigated how these interactions vary with land-use intensity. They analysed data from 300 German grasslands and forests, varying in land-use intensity, and borrowed approaches from network analysis to characterize the overall relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services.""We already knew that land use affects biodiversity and ecosystem functioning,"" says the lead author of the paper Dr Felipe-Lucia, senior scientist at UFZ and iDiv. ""But we knew very little about how land-use intensity simultaneously alters the relationships between diversities, functions and services. By understanding these relationships, we can anticipate how future changes in land use will affect ecosystems and human wellbeing.""We cannot intensify without limits: varied landscapes are the keyThe study demonstrates that low intensity farming and forestry can provide material benefits (fodder, timber), while preserving biodiversity. In contrast, high intensity practices increase material benefits but reduce biodiversity and the benefits people derive from it.""With increasing land-use intensity we are losing specialized relationships,"" Felipe-Lucia concludes. ""This is comparable to shopping either in a low-quality mega-store or in a specialized boutique."" Similar to specialized boutiques, where it is necessary to visit many different of them to get the best items, low land-use intensity grasslands and forests are specialized in a particular set of biodiversity, functions and associated services. High land-use intensity landscapes are comparable to mega-stores where all kinds of goods can be found at one place, but of lower quality.""As in any city, it is ok to have a couple of mega-stores, but we cannot neglect the smaller high-quality boutiques either. In our landscapes, we need to maintain pockets of low land-use intensity to provide these specialized gifts,"" explains Allan, senior athour of the paper.In healthy ecosystems, more species usually means higher levels of ecosystem services for people and therefore better human wellbeing. ""Intensification tends to homogenize biodiversity-functioning-service relationships and lead to a less integrated system with fewer positive relations between services,"" points out Allan. ""Diverse low intensity systems can provide different sets of services and a varied landscape could therefore be the key to solve conflicting land uses and provide a wider range of services while preserving biodiversity.""""We also identified the level of management intensity that disrupts the normal functioning of the landscape, that is, when the ecosystem becomes more dependent on human inputs (such as fertilizer) for its functioning,"" says Felipe-Lucia.The new analyses can help to detect the loss of correlations between biodiversity and ecosystem services, which could be taken as an early warning signal of ecosystem change. ""Our approach provides a new and comprehensive view of ecosystem functioning and can identify the key ecosystem attributes to monitor in order to prevent critical shifts in ecosystems,"" says Allan.

Until now, it has been widely held that biogeochemical changes are mainly driven by reactions of phytoplankton. Therefore, even modern Earth system models do not take into account the interactions we observe between the marine food web and the carbon cycle. Our findings thus help to make climate models more realistic and improve climate projections.""Up to now, most of the knowledge on this topic has been based on idealized laboratory experiments, which only represent ecological interactions and the dynamics of the complex marine food web in a highly simplified way. This makes it difficult to transfer such results to real ocean conditions and project them into the future. In order to gain a more realistic insight, the study summarizes several field experiments that were conducted with large-volume test facilities, so-called mesocosms, in different ocean regions, from arctic to subtropical waters.Mesocosms are, so to speak, oversized test tubes in the ocean, in which changes in environmental conditions in a closed but otherwise natural ecosystem can be studied. For the present study, a large amount of data from five mesocosm experiments was synthesized to provide a more precise picture of plankton communities and biogeochemical processes within the ecosystem.

As such, there have been times in which the transition between the two climate states appeared with either regular or irregular periodicity. AWI researcher Peter Köhler has now discovered that the irregular appearance of interglacials has been more frequent than previously thought. His study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of Earth's fundamental climate changes.","In order to understand human beings' role in the development of our current climate, we have to look back a long way, since there has always been climate change -- albeit over vastly different timescales than the anthropogenic climate change, which is mainly due to the use of fossil fuels over the past 200 years. Without humans, for millions of years, climate altered between glacial and interglacial states over periods of many thousands of years, mainly because of the Earth's tilt which changes by a few degrees with a periodicity of 41,000 years. This in turn changes the angle at which the sun's rays strike Earth -- and as such the energy that reaches the planet, especially at high latitudes in summer. However, there is strong evidence that during the course of the last 2.6 million years, interglacials have repeatedly been 'skipped'. The Northern Hemisphere -- particularly North America -- remained frozen for long periods, despite the angle of the axial tilt changing to such an extent that more solar energy once again reached Earth during the summer, which should have melted the inland ice masses. This means Earth's tilt can't be the sole reason for Earth's climate to alter between glacial and interglacial states.In order to solve the puzzle, climate researchers are investigating more closely at what points in Earth's history irregularities occurred. Together with colleagues at Utrecht University, physicist Peter Köhler from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) has now made a significant contribution towards providing a clearer picture of the sequence of glacial and interglacial periods over the last 2.6 million years. Until now, experts thought that, especially over the past 1.0 million years, glacial and interglacial periods deviated from their 41,000- year cycle, and that interglacial periods were skipped, as a result of which some glacial periods lasted for 80,0000 or even 120,000 years. ""For the period between 2.6 and 1.0 million years ago, it was assumed that the rhythm was 41,000 years,"" says Peter Köhler. But as his study, which has now been published in the scientific journal Köhler's study is particularly interesting because he re-evaluated a well-known dataset that researchers have been using for several years -- the LR04 climate dataset -- yet arrived at completely different conclusions. This dataset consists of a global evaluation of core samples from deep-sea sediments that are millions of years old, and includes measurements from the ancient shells of microscopic, single-celled marine organisms -- foraminifera -- that were deposited on the ocean floor. Foraminifera incorporate oxygen from the seawater into their calcium shells. But over millennia, the level of specific oxygen isotopes -- oxygen atoms that have differing numbers of neutrons and therefore different masses -- varies in seawater.The LR04 dataset contains measurements of the ratio of the heavy oxygen isotope 18O to the lighter 16O. The ratio of 18O/16O stored in the foraminifera's shells depends on the water temperature. But there is also another effect that leads to relatively large amounts of 18O being found in the foraminifera's shells in glacial periods: when, during the course of a glacial period, there is heavy snowfall on land, which leads to the formation of thick ice sheets, the sea level falls -- in the period studied, by as much as 120 m. Since 18O is heavier than 16O, water molecules containing this heavy isotope evaporate less readily than molecules containing the lighter isotope. As such, comparatively more 18O remains in the ocean and the 18O content of the foraminifera shells increases. ""If you take the LR04 dataset at face value, it means you blur two effects -- the influence of ocean temperature and that of land ice, or rather that of sea level change,"" says Peter Köhler. ""This makes statements regarding the alternation of the glacial periods uncertain."" And there is an additional factor: climate researchers mainly determine the sequence of glacial periods on the basis of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere. But using 18O values doesn't allow us to say whether prehistoric glaciation chiefly occurred in the Northern Hemisphere or in Antarctica.In an attempt to solve this problem, Köhler and his team evaluated the LR04 dataset in a completely different way. The data was fed into a computer model that simulates the growth and melting of the large continental ice sheets. What sets it apart: the model is capable of separating the influence of temperature and that of sea level change on the 18O concentration. Furthermore, it can accurately analyse where and when snow falls and the ice increases -- more in the Northern Hemisphere or in Antarctica. ""Mathematicians call this separation a deconvolution,"" Köhler explains, ""which our model is capable of delivering."" The results show that the sequence of glacials and interglacials was irregular even in the period 2.6 to 1.0 million years ago -- a finding that could be crucial in the coming years. As part of the ongoing major EU project 'BE-OIC (Beyond EPICA Oldest Ice Core)', researchers are drilling deeper than ever before into the Antarctic ice. With the oldest ice core recovered to date, 'EPICA', they have 'only' travelled back roughly 800,000 years into the past. The ancient ice provides, among other things, information on how much carbon dioxide Earth's atmosphere contained at that time. With 'Beyond EPICA' they will delve circa 1.5 million years into the past. By combining the carbon dioxide measurements with Köhler's analyses, valuable insights can be gained into the relation between these two factors -- the fluctuations in the sequence of glacials and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. And this can help us understand the fundamental relationship between greenhouse gases and climate changes in Earth's glacial history.",Climate,2020.0,"A study by physicist Peter Köhler from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) has provided insight into the sequence of glacial and interglacial periods over the last 2.6 million years.

If there is a lack of insects where the plants are growing, their flowering behaviour changes. This can result in the lifecycles of the insects and the flowering periods of the plants no longer coinciding. If the insects seek nectar at the wrong time, some plants will no longer be pollinated.Ecosystems are changing around the world, in particular due to global warming and altered land use. Insect species are dying out and the insect biomass is decreasing. Researchers have therefore studied how the biodiversity of plants is changing in the context of climate change. For this purpose, various climate scenarios have been simulated, using different temperatures and precipitation.In a new study reported in the specialist journal ""We know that the insect biomass is decreasing,"" says Josephine Ulrich, a doctoral candidate from Römermann's team, referring to a study from 2017 which detected that insects had declined by 75 per cent over the previous 30 years.The Jena research group has now studied in detail for the first time the extent to which decreasing insect density influences plant development. Whereas previous studies had only carried out field experiments, the research team used the ""Ecotron,"" an iDiv research facility where identical climatic situations can be simulated in artificial ecosystems and observed with cameras.In their experiment, the researchers studied how plant composition and plant development change if the number of insects falls by three-quarters.Ulrich and her colleagues discovered that the reduced insect biomass brings about a change in plant species. It is especially the dominant plant species, such as red clover, which become more prevalent. The development of the flowering period also changes as insect density declines. Some of the plants studied flowered earlier and others later.""These changes can lead to mismatches between plant and animal species, which lead to adverse consequences for the ecosystem,"" says Ulrich, the lead author of the study. Examples are the food supply of insects and pollination success. This deterioration in the ecosystem function could entail further losses of insect and plant species. An additional consequence could be that plants become increasingly infested with pests. Due to the falling numbers of insects that feed on aphids, for example, these pests could spread unchecked.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study from the University of Jena and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle-Jena-Leipzig (iDiv) has found that insects play a vital role in the biodiversity and flowering phases of plants.

Now a team of Penn State researchers suggests that considering uncertainties can improve decisions.""Many houses located along rivers in Pennsylvania are in danger of being flooded,"" said Klaus Keller, professor of geosciences. ""Some houses are elevated high, some to intermediate levels, and some not at all. Why is this?""People in river flood zones are looking for good strategies on how high to elevate their houses.

This is the minimum elevation for which federal funding may be available. The researchers investigated if they might improve on this suggested elevation given uncertainties surrounding, for example, future flooding, the future value of money and the vulnerability of a house to flooding. They reported their results today (Oct. 26) in ""Looking at the range of possible outcomes can help to improve decisions on how high to elevate a house,"" said Mahkameh Zarekarizi, former Penn State postdoctoral fellow, now a hydroclimate scientist at Jupiter Intelligence.

As a result, countries place pressures on natural resources both within and beyond their borders.Researchers from the University of Cambridge used macroeconomic data to quantify these pressures. They found that the vast majority of countries and industrial sectors are highly exposed both directly, via domestic production, and indirectly, via imports, to over-exploited and insecure water, energy and land resources. However, the researchers found that the greatest resource risk is due to international trade, mainly from remote countries.The researchers are calling for an urgent enquiry into the scale and source of consumed goods and services, both in individual countries and globally, as economies seek to rebuild in the wake of Covid-19. Their study, published in the journal Over the past several decades, the worldwide economy has become highly interconnected through globalisation: it is now not uncommon for each component of a particular product to originate from a different country. Globalisation allows companies to make their products almost anywhere in the world in order to keep costs down.Many mainstream economists argue this offers countries a source of competitive advantage and growth potential. However, many nations impose demands on already stressed resources in other countries in order to satisfy their own high levels of consumption.This interconnectedness also increases the amount of risk at each step of a global supply chain. For example, the UK imports 50% of its food. A drought, flood or any severe weather event in another country puts these food imports at risk.Now, the researchers have quantified the global water, land and energy use of189 countries and shown that countries which are highly dependent on trade are potentially more at risk from resource insecurity, especially as climate change continues to accelerate and severe weather events such as droughts and floods become more common.""There has been plenty of research comparing countries in terms of their water, energy and land footprints, but what hasn't been studied is the scale and source of their risks,"" said Dr Oliver Taherzadeh from Cambridge's Department of Geography. ""We found that the role of trade has been massively underplayed as a source of resource insecurity -- it's actually a bigger source of risk than domestic production.""To date, resource use studies have been limited to certain regions or sectors, which prevents a systematic overview of resource pressures and their source. This study offers a flexible approach to examining pressures across the system at various geographical and sectoral scales.""This type of analysis hasn't been carried out for a large number of countries before,"" said Taherzadeh. ""By quantifying the pressures that our consumption places on water, energy and land resources in far-off corners of the world, we can also determine how much risk is built into our interconnected world.""The authors of the study linked indices designed to capture insecure water, energy, and land resource use, to a global trade model in order to examine the scale and sources of national resource insecurity from domestic production and imports.Countries with large economies, such as the US, China and Japan, are highly exposed to water shortages outside their borders due to their volume of international trade. However, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya, actually face far less risk as they are not as heavily networked in the global economy and are relatively self-sufficient in food production.In addition to country-level data, the researchers also examined the risks associated with specific sectors. Surprisingly, one of the sectors identified in Taherzadeh's wider research that had the most high-risk water and land use -- among the top 1% of nearly 15,000 sectors analysed -- was dog and cat food manufacturing in the USA, due to its high demand for animal products.""Covid-19 has shown just how poorly-prepared governments and businesses are for a global crisis,"" said Taherzadeh. ""But however bad the direct and indirect consequences of Covid-19 have been, climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse and resource insecurity are far less predictable problems to manage -- and the potential consequences are far more severe.

From the air, that tundra would look like a landscape of room-sized polygonal shapes. Those shapes are the surface manifestations of the ice in the frozen ground below, a solidified earth known as permafrost.","Scientists long believed the solid permafrost extended offshore: from the tundra, below that narrow beach and below the seafloor declining at a gentle slope. They viewed that permafrost like solid brick, locking the subsurface -- and the vast amounts of carbon it holds -- in place.But new research led by Micaela Pedrazas, who earned her masters at The University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences working with Professor Bayani Cardenas, has upended that paradigm. They found permafrost to be mostly absent throughout the shallow seafloor along a coastal field site in northeastern Alaska. That means carbon can be released from coastline sources much more easily than previously thought.The study was published in Using a geophysical technique called electrical resistivity imaging, the researchers mapped the subsurface beneath Kaktovik Lagoon along the northeastern coast of Alaska over the course of three years.The results were unexpected. The beach and seafloor were entirely ice-free down to at least 65 feet. On the tundra itself, ice-rich permafrost was detected in the top 16 feet, but below that, the subsurface their imaging mapped was also ice-free.""This leads to a new conceptual model,"" Pedrazas said.Permafrost is found in cold climates that remain frozen during the course of the year. Scientists have been tracking the impact of a warming climate on permafrost because as it melts, permafrost releases its stores of frozen carbon into the atmosphere as methane and carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change.Permafrost studies have almost exclusively focused on the region beneath the tundra. Because it's not easy to work in such remote locations and under harsh weather conditions, the transition from sea to shore has been largely ignored.""This study tells us that the coastline is much more complicated than we thought,"" said co-author Jim McClelland from UT's Marine Science Institute. ""It opens up the possibility for routes of water exchange that we weren't thinking about.""Besides global considerations, the work has local impacts. The communities along the coast, most of whom are Inupiat, live on the permafrost. As the permafrost thaws, it accelerates coastal erosion, which carves away at the land on which homes and infrastructure stand. In the Kaktovik region, erosion can be as great as 13 feet per year.""Their cultural heritage and their welfare is integrated and intricately linked to their environment,"" Cardenas said. ""There's an immediate need to understand what's happening in these lagoons.""The new paradigm requires reimagining the coastal Arctic ecosystem as well. Liquid groundwater means that carbon and nutrients can move between the tundra and the lagoon. It also means that saltwater can move beneath the tundra, potentially affecting freshwater sources.Paul Overduin, who wasn't involved in the research, but who studies permafrost at Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, said that this work is the first step in understanding permafrost's transition from sea to shore.""As is often the case, when we start looking at something people don't know much about, you open up a whole bunch of questions that needed to be looked at,"" he said.

Now genome sequencing of hundreds of bees from the northern and southern limits shows a gradual decline in African ancestry across hundreds of miles, rather than an abrupt shift.","""There's a gradual transition at the same latitude in North and South America,"" said Erin Calfee, graduate student in the Department of Evolution and Ecology at the University of California, Davis, and first author on the paper, published Oct. 19 in PLOS Genetics. ""There's a natural barrier that is likely maintained by many different genetic loci.""That barrier is mostly likely climate. Bees with majority African ancestry are unable to survive colder winters.European colonists brought European species of honeybees (Apis mellifera) with them to the Americas as early as the 1600s. In addition to apiaries, these bees established in the wild alongside native bees.In 1957, imported African honeybees of the subspecies Apis mellifera scutellata swarmed out of experimental hives in Brazil and started to rapidly spread, interbreeding with the resident European bees. Native to southern and eastern Africa, scutellata bees are known for their defensive behavior. They also carry some useful traits for beekeepers, such as resistance to Varroa mites.Calfee, working with Professor Graham Coop and Associate Professor Santiago Ramirez from the Department of Evolution and Ecology and collaborators in Argentina, sequenced the genomes of bees collected at the northern and southern edges of the scutellata expansion.They found that the bees at the northern and southern edges of the range have a highly variable mix of scutellata and European bee ancestry. The higher the latitude, the less scutellata ancestry is in the mix.""The whole genome is tracking latitude and climate,"" Calfee said. There are likely many genes involved in climate sensitivity and winter survival, she said. But Calfee also finds that in some parts of the genome scutellata ancestry has spread far beyond these climate limits in both North and South America, evidence that some scutellata genes are advantageous and not tied to climate sensitivity. In contrast, the researchers did not find any evidence for selection for European ancestry in the spread of scutellata bees.The findings challenge the idea of a binary difference between ""Africanized"" and ""European"" honeybees, Ramirez said. In fact, all of these introduced honeybees are hybrids to some degree.The results of the study could be of interest for breeding bees for desirable traits, such as resistance to pathogens. Although the researchers looked only at gene sequences and not the resulting phenotypes (except for one, wing length), the results do show which genetic loci are important because they are under selection in the hybrid zones.Scutellata bees and hybrids have a lot more genetic diversity than European bees, and the researchers found that they lost very little of this diversity in their expansion from Brazil to California.""Beekeepers can potentially draw from this genetic variation to breed for desirable traits,"" Ramirez said. What started out as an invasion may become part of the solution to declining bee health.""It makes sense but it's kind of surprising because we have 1.5 million (honeybee) colonies being brought into California every spring to pollinate crops,"" Ramirez said. Those domesticated bees are then trucked around the country, but they do not appear to have a large effect on the spread of African ancestry into feral honeybee populations.",Climate,2020.0,"African and European honeybees in North and South America are not as genetically distinct as previously thought, according to a study by the University of California, Davis.

The study also revealed that the bees’ genomes are affected by climate and latitude, with Africanised bees unable to survive colder winters. The findings could be used to breed bees with desirable traits such as pathogen resistance.",,

Freshwater lakes in the region ensured a reliable source of water, and large grazing herbivores roamed the grasslands. Then, around 400,000 years ago, things changed. The environment became less predictable, and human ancestors faced new sources of instability and uncertainty that challenged their previous long-standing way of life.","The first analysis of a new sedimentary drill core representing 1 million years of environmental history in the East African Rift Valley shows that at the same time early humans were abandoning old tools in favor of more sophisticated technology and broadening their trade networks, their landscape was experiencing frequent fluctuations in vegetation and water supply that made resources less reliably available. The findings suggest that instability in their surrounding climate, land and ecosystem was a key driver in the development of new traits and behaviors underpinning human adaptability.In the Oct. 21 issue of the journal Potts and colleagues documented this behavioral and cultural shift in 2018 based on artifacts recovered at an archaeological site known as Olorgesailie. Decades of study at Olorgesailie by Potts' team and collaborators at the National Museums of Kenya have determined that early humans at Olorgesailie relied on the same tools, stone handaxes, for 700,000 years. Their way of life during this period was remarkably stable, with no major changes in their behaviors and strategies for survival. Then, beginning around 320,000 years ago, people living there entered the Middle Stone Age, crafting smaller, more sophisticated weapons, including projectiles. At the same time, they began to trade resources with distant groups and to use coloring materials, suggesting symbolic communication. All these changes were a significant departure from their previous lifestyle, likely helping early humans cope with their newly variable landscape, Potts said.""The history of human evolution has been one of increasing adaptability,"" Potts said. ""We come from a family tree that's diverse, but all of those other ways of being human are now extinct. There's only one of us left, and we may well be the most adaptable species that may have ever existed on the face of the Earth.""While some scientists have proposed that climate fluctuations alone may have driven humans to evolve this remarkable quality of adaptability, the new study indicates the picture is more complicated than that. Instead, the team's analysis shows that climate variability is but one of several intertwined environmental factors that drove the cultural shift they described in 2018. The new analysis reveals how a changing climate along with new land faults introduced by tectonic activity and ecological disruptions in the vegetation and fauna all came together to drive disruptions that made technological innovation, trading resources and symbolic communication¬ -- three key factors in adaptability -- beneficial for early humans in this region.In seeking to understand the major evolutionary transition they had uncovered at Olorgesailie, Potts and his team had been frustrated by a large gap in the region's environmental record. Erosion at Olorgesailie, a hilly area full of sedimentary outcrops, had removed the geologic layers representing some 180,000 years of time at exactly the period of this evolutionary transition. To learn about how the region changed during that period, they had to look elsewhere.They arranged to have a Nairobi company drill in the nearby Koora basin, extracting sediment from as deep into the earth as they could. The drill site, about 15 miles from the archaeological dig sites, was a flat, grassy plain, and the team had no clear idea what was beneath its surface. With the involvement and support from the National Museums of Kenya and the local Oldonyo Nyokie community, a 139-meter core was removed from the earth. That cylinder of earth, just four centimeters in diameter, turned out to represent 1 million years of environmental history.Colleagues in the National Museum of Natural History's Human Origins Program and Department of Paleobiology and dozens of collaborators at institutions worldwide worked to analyze the environmental record they had obtained, which is now the most precisely dated African environmental record of the past 1 million years. Charting radioisotope ages and changes in chemical composition and deposits left by plants and microscopic organisms through the different layers of the core, the team reconstructed key features of the ancient landscape and climate across time.They found that after a long period of stability, the environment in this part of Africa became more variable around 400,000 years ago, when tectonic activity fragmented the landscape. By integrating information from the drill core with knowledge gleaned from fossils and archeological artifacts, they determined that the entire ecosystem evolved in response.The team's analysis suggests that as parts of the grassy plains in the region were fragmented along fault lines due to tectonic activity, small basins formed. These areas were more sensitive to changes in rainfall than the larger lake basins that had been there before. Elevated terrain also allowed water runoff from high ground to contribute to the formation and drying out of lakes. These changes occurred during a period when precipitation had become more variable, leading to frequent and dramatic fluctuations in water supply.With the fluctuations, a broader set of ecological changes also took place. The team found that vegetation in the region also changed repeatedly, shifting between grassy plains and wooded areas. Meanwhile, large grazing herbivores, which no longer had large tracts of grass to feed on, began to die out and were replaced by smaller mammals with more diverse diets.""There was a massive change in the animal fauna during the time period when we see early human behavior changing,"" Potts said. ""The animals also influenced the landscape through the kinds of plants that they ate. Then with humans in the mix, and some of their innovations like projectile weapons, they also may have affected the fauna. It's a whole ecosystem changing, with humans as part of it.""Finally, Potts notes that while adaptability is a hallmark of human evolution, that does not mean the species is necessarily equipped to endure the unprecedented change Earth is now experiencing due to man-made climate change and Anthropogenic biodiversity loss. ""We have an astonishing capacity to adapt, biologically in our genes as well as culturally and socially,"" he said. ""The question is, are we now creating through our own activities new sources of environmental disruption that will continue to challenge human adaptability?""Funding for this research was provided by the William H.

However, the expansion of species ranges is not self-evident due to e.g. habitat degradation and unsustainable harvesting caused by human activities. A new study led from the University of Turku, Finland, suggests that protected areas can facilitate wintering waterbird adaptation to climate warming by advancing their range shifts towards north.","Researchers of the new study investigated the role of protected areas for the range shifts of wintering waterbirds in Europe and North Africa. Species communities were noted to shift faster inside protected areas compared to other areas.- Range shifts of waterbirds have been over 40 percent faster inside protected areas compared to outside areas. On average, species communities have shifted inside protected areas c. 90 kilometres in 25 years, says Postdoctoral Researcher Elie Gaget from the University of Turku.Protected areas not only increased the colonisation towards northern areas, but also prevented local extinctions on the southern range of species compared to non-protected areas. This suggests that protected areas can contribute to expand the overall range of species.In addition to single protected areas, the protected area network as a whole influenced the spread of waterbird species. Shifts in species communities were faster in areas with a dense protected area network compared to areas where the network was sparse.- Our findings highlight that protected area networks, historically established to fight habitat degradation and over-exploitation of natural resources, are now also important to mitigate the negative effects of climate warming on biodiversity, says Professor Jon Brommer from the University of Turku.The study is part of an international collaboration that utilised tens of thousands of waterbird surveys covering 97 species from 39 countries during 25 years.

Which climatic processes have influenced the earth and its atmosphere? Paleoclimatology seeks answers to such questions in order to better understand climate changes and to derive forecasts for future climate scenarios. So-called sedimentary archives serve as a basis for this. They are rock deposits whose components and composition provide information about the temperatures and climatic conditions at the time of their formation. Correspondingly recent geological deposits provide information about the climate development in the recent history of the earth since the last ice age 20,000 years ago. Compared to widespread seawater deposits, however, sedimentary archives on the mainland -- such as in the Alpine region -- are very rare.","An international consortium led by the Institute of Applied Geosciences (IAG) of Graz University of Technology has now made a sensational discovery in this area. In a publication for Specifically, these are sedimentary fillings of faults and fractures which consist of the carbonate minerals dolomite, aragonite and calcite. It is known that the carbonate mineral dolomite crystallizes when seawater evaporates, which in turn requires high temperatures. Baldermann and his team have now been able to show for the first time that the mineral can also form at temperatures between zero and twenty degrees Celsius -- there has been no absolute data on this so far.In addition, the researchers discovered that these are comparatively geologically young minerals that were formed shortly after the last ice age about 20,000 years ago in a non-marine (continental) depositional area. Baldermann: ""This is a novelty, as recent formations of the mineral have been restricted almost exclusively to seawater deposits until now.""The entire range of geological investigation methods was used in the analyses. The rock samples were microscopically described and systematically classified. The mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and the chemical properties were defined using high-resolution electron microscopy. For age dating and temperature reconstructions, the samples were analysed elementally and isotopically using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry.

Some of the world regions are experiencing high population growth rates, which means more phosphorus will be needed to produce an increasing amount of food needed in the next decades. A new study -- Global phosphorus supply chain dynamics: Assessing regional impact to 2050 -- published in the scientific journal ","Almost all of our phosphate fertilizers come from the mining and processing of phosphate rock (PR) and only a handful of countries produce and export this mineral. Losses along the Phosphorus (P) supply chain have been estimated in the literature at around 80-90% . At the same time, global population growth is expected to push food demand up by more than 50% to 2050, particularly in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), South Asia (SA) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) . Despite being a vital resource in food production, P is also a key pollutant in water bodies, where it can cause eutrophication. Processing PR is also an energy-intensive process, which uses significant quantities of water and produces large quantities of phosphogypsum (PG), a toxic and radioactive byproduct.""Most of the focus in the literature has been on the sufficiency of the global phosphorus reserves. However, demand for phosphorus is unequal across regions so it was important to assess which regions require more phosphorus and what will that mean in terms of food security. Another valuable contribution of this study is that we quantified the negative environmental and climate impacts of the phosphorus supply chain at global and regional level. Our results indicate yet again the necessity of closing the loop when it comes to phosphorus and on reducing its usage through more sustainable farming practices"" says Claudiu Eduard Nedelciu, researcher at the Department of Physical Geography and main author of the study.The study, which is part of a larger European research project, Adaptation to a new Economic Reality, found that LAC, SA and ESEA will lead the increasing consumption of P in the coming decades. Surprisingly, SSA did not account for a significant increase in the P requirement to 2050, despite developing the highest population growth during the period. This is due to the historically low levels of fertilizer application in the region, but poses serious questions about food security, as this part of the world concentrates most of the undernourished people in the world. All the regions leading the increase in P requirement were also regions highly dependent on phosphate imports and thus vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions.""Hunger will increase in the parts of the world where phosphorus is lacking, unless actions are taken by governments and international institutions to secure imports,"" aid Prof. Kristin Vala Ragnasdottir from the University of Iceland, co-author in the study.Perhaps the most striking results were related to the impact of the P supply chain on the environment and climate. The amount of P reaching water bodies will more than triple in North Africa and Western Asia and will double in South Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. This trend will be driven by P runoff from agricultural land and it is an optimistic scenario, as it assumes that the 2030 wastewater treatment targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be achieved in all world regions. At current P runoff rates and without ambitious prevention measures, more coastal areas and inland water bodies are likely to be subject to eutrophication.""Not only the efficient use of Phosphorus in agriculture but wise management of Phosphorus resources along the supply chain, including environmental effects, will be major challenges for the coming decades"" said Prof. Peter Schlyter of the Blekinge Technology Institute and co-author in the study.Climate impact resulting from the mining and processing of PR will double in 2050 compared to 2000, while the amount of phosphogypsum production will reach 500 million tons/year if no technological improvements are made. Production of phosphogypsum raises serious questions with regard to its safe disposal and management, owing to its toxicity and radioactivity.

A friend who was bicycling to work past the white sands and palm tree edges of Key Biscayne, an island town south of Miami, sent Stroud a picture of a 2-foot long lizard splayed out on its back. With its feet in the air, the iguana took up most of the sidewalk.The previous night was south Florida's coldest in 10 years, at just under 40 degrees Fahrenheit. While most people reached for an extra blanket or a pair of socks, Stroud -- a postdoctoral research associate in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis -- frantically texted a collaborator:""Today's the day to drop everything, go catch some lizards.""When temperatures go below a critical limit, sleeping lizards lose their grip and fall out of trees. From previous research, Stroud and his colleagues had learned that different types of lizards in Miami can tolerate different low temperatures, ranging from about 46 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit, before they are stunned by cold. This cold snap provided a unique opportunity to understand how they are affected by extreme climate events.But when the researchers collected the scaled survivors of that coldest night, they discovered that the lizard community responded in an unexpected way: all of them could tolerate cold temperatures down to about 42 degrees Fahrenheit, regardless of their species' previous ability to withstand cold. The findings are reported Oct. 21 in the journal ""Prior to this, and for a different study, we had measured the lowest temperatures that six lizard species in south Florida could tolerate,"" Stroud said. ""We realized after the 2020 cold event that these data were now extremely valuable -- we had the opportunity to re-measure the same lizard populations to observe if their physiological limits had changed; in other words, could these species now tolerate lower temperatures?""In the days that followed the January cold snap, researchers collected representatives of as many different kinds of lizards as they could find in the local area, rounding up small and large lizards and those that are active during the day and at night. Then the researchers tested their response to cold.""A major unexpected result of this study was that all species converged on the same new, lower level of thermal tolerance,"" Stroud said. ""While there was great variation in temperature tolerance before the cold event -- some, like the large-bodied brown basilisk, were very intolerant of low temperatures, while others like the Puerto Rican crested anole were more robust -- we observed that all species could now tolerate, on average, the same lowest temperature.""Given great variation in body size, ecology and physiology, this was unexpected,"" he said.Only one of the species in the study is native to the area; the rest have been introduced to Florida over the past century, researchers noted.The results provide evidence that tropical, cold-blooded creatures -- often characterized as unable to withstand rapid changes in climatic conditions -- can sometimes endure conditions that exceed their established physiological limits.""The shifts to tolerate significantly lower temperatures that we observed were so large that we found it unclear whether natural selection was responsible,"" Stroud said. ""And so in our paper we discuss other alternative processes which may also have led to this pattern.""""The results of this study are surprising and unexpected. Who would have thought that tropical lizards from places like Puerto Rico and Central America could withstand temperatures near freezing?"" said Jonathan Losos, the William H. Danforth Distinguished University Professor and professor of biology in Arts & Sciences and director of the Living Earth Collaborative at Washington University.""What we now need to find out is how this was accomplished. Is this evidence of natural selection, with those lizards that just happened to have a lower cold tolerance surviving and others freezing to death, or was it an example of physiological adjustment -- termed 'acclimation' -- in which exposure to lower temperatures changes a lizard's physiology so that it is capable of withstanding lower temperatures?""Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the new study provides a critically important piece of information for understanding the impacts of climate change.Scientists expect that air temperatures will gradually become warmer under climate change, but also that temperatures will become more chaotic.Events that spike temperature to extremes -- both exceptionally hot and exceptionally cold episodes -- will increase in frequency and magnitude. As such, it is important to understand both the effects of gradual, long-term increases in air temperatures as well as the consequences of abrupt, short-term extreme events.""It is widely thought that tropical and subtropical species are going to be especially vulnerable to changes in temperature -- particularly extreme spikes of heat or cold -- as tropical areas do not typically have strong seasons,"" Stroud said. ""Unlike temperate species, which are adapted to summer highs and winter lows, tropical species have typically evolved in very thermally stable environments.""While there is no doubt that climate change represents a major threat to species and ecosystems around the world, and deserves as much research attention as possible, this study provides fascinating insight and a glimpse of hope,"" he said.

In addition, the experts warn that the warming of the Weddell Sea could permanently weaken the overturning of tremendous water masses that takes place there -- with far-reaching consequences for global ocean circulation. Their study was just released on the online portal of the ","Over the past several decades, the world's oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse-gas emissions, effectively slowing the rise in air temperatures around the globe. In this regard, the Southern Ocean is pivotal. Though it only accounts for 15 percent of the world's oceans in terms of area, because of the overturning that takes place there, it absorbs roughly three-fourths of the heat.Until recently, very little was known about what happens to this heat in the depths of the Southern Ocean, due to the lack of sufficiently long time series. In order to trace the development down to the seafloor, researchers relied on regularly repeated ship-based measurements taken with 'CTD' probes (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth). These probes have now become so precise that they can measure changes in water temperature down to the nearest ten-thousandth of a degree Celsius. The data they gather can also be used to determine the water masses' density and salinity.For the past 30 years, AWI oceanographers have been taking these temperature and salinity readings during expeditions to the Weddell Sea on board the German research icebreaker Polarstern -- always at the same sites, always from the surface to the seafloor, and always with extremely high accuracy. By doing so, the researchers have produced the only time series of its kind on the South Atlantic and the Weddell Sea, which has now allowed them to precisely reconstruct the warming of the Weddell Sea and identify potential causes.Their findings are surprising. ""Our data shows a clear division in the water column of the Weddell Sea. While the water in the upper 700 metres has hardly warmed at all, in the deeper regions we're seeing a consistent temperature rise of 0.0021 to 0.0024 degrees Celsius per year,"" says Dr Volker Strass, an AWI oceanographer and the study's first author.These values may seem minuscule at first glance. But, as Strass explains, ""Since the ocean has roughly 1,000 times the heat capacity of the atmosphere, these numbers represent an enormous scale of heat absorption. By using the temperature rise to calculate the warming rate in watts per square metre, you can see that over the past 30 years, at depths of over 2,000 metres the Weddell Sea has absorbed five times as much heat as the rest of the ocean on average."" Through the formation of bottom water in the Weddell Sea, this heat is then distributed to the deep basins of the world's oceans.In the Weddell Sea, which represents the southern extension of the Atlantic Ocean and is roughly ten times the size of the North Sea, tremendous water masses cool down. In the course of sea-ice formation they take on salt, sink to deeper water layers as cold and heavy Antarctic Bottom Water, and then spread to the great ocean basins as a deep-sea current. This overturning is considered to be an important motor for the global ocean circulation. The warming of the depths of the Weddell Sea could weaken that motor, since warmer water has a lower density. Consequently, it is lighter and could fill higher layers of the water column.""Our field data already shows a temperature-related loss in density in the deeper water masses of the Weddell Sea. This change is most pronounced in the Bottom Water,"" says co-author and AWI oceanographer Gerd Rohardt. Whether or not the Antarctic Bottom Water will continue to fulfil its function as the deepest limb of the global ocean overturning circulation chiefly depends on how the density of the water masses above it changes. ""In order to monitor these developments, we'll need to continue our regular ship-based readings in the Weddell Sea,"" says the researcher.As the cause of the increased heat input in the depths of the Weddell Sea, the researchers have identified a change in the wind and current systems over and in the Southern Ocean. ""Over the past three decades, the westerlies and with them the Antarctic Circumpolar Current have not only shifted one to two degrees to the south; they have also intensified. As a result, the diameter of the Weddell Gyre has decreased, and the flow speed of the water masses has increased. Because of these two factors, more heat from the Circumpolar Current is transported to the Weddell Sea today than when we first began our measurements,"" explains Prof Torsten Kanzow, Head of the AWI's Climate Sciences Division and another co-author of the study.Once the heat reaches the depths of the Weddell Sea, the major bottom water currents distribute it to all ocean basins. ""Our time series confirms the pivotal role of the Southern Ocean and especially the Weddell Sea in terms of storing heat in the depths of the world's oceans,"" says Volker Strass. If the warming of the Weddell Sea continues unchecked, he explains, it will have far-reaching consequences not only for the massive ice shelves on the southern coast of the Weddell Sea, which extend far out into the ocean, and as such, for sea-level rise in the long term, but also for the conveyor belt of ocean circulation as a whole.",Climate,2020.0,"The Southern Ocean has absorbed around 90% of the heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse-gas emissions over the past few decades, with the Weddell Sea playing a pivotal role. It has only recently been discovered that the Weddell Sea has been absorbing heat in its deeper regions at a consistent rate of 0.0021 to 0.0024 degrees Celsius per year, which has resulted in it absorbing five times more heat than the rest of the ocean on average. The warming of the depths of the Weddell Sea could weaken the ocean's circulation system, which has far-reaching consequences for sea-level rise and ocean",,

And as the level of carbon dioxide rises in the atmosphere, it's absorbed by the oceans, causing pH levels to fall. Ocean acidification makes it difficult for shellfish to thicken their shells -- their primary defense against predators.","In a new study in the journal ""These species are often overlooked because of how common they are,"" Petraitis says. ""They're just everywhere across the rocky shores. People don't think anything is going to happen to them. If they decline by about 3% a year that's a relatively small change so you might not notice it for a while. But one year, people are going to suddenly look around and say, 'Where are all the snails, mussels and barnacles?'""These species ""form the core of an iconic food web"" in the Gulf of Maine, says Dudgeon. ""Concurrent declines of five species, including both native and non-native, is proportionally large, and may cause profound changes in the ecology of coastal oceans in the region.""In 1997, Petraitis and Dudgeon set up a long-term experiment on the Gulf of Maine's Swan's Island to study the ecological principles of multiple stable states. A focus of Petraitis's research and the subject of his 2013 book, ""Multiple Stable States in Natural Ecosystems,"" the concept encapsulates the idea that an ecosystem can switch quickly between entirely different compositions of organisms, given the right environmental perturbations.For shellfish on Swan's Island, one such perturbation occurs when periodic powerful winter storms cause sea ice to scrape off all the organisms attached to rocks on the shore, forcing the communities to rebuild from scratch the next year.In 1996, Petraitis and Dudgeon simulated a single massive ice scouring event by scraping the rocks to see what would happen as the shore recolonized. Since then the researchers have been making an annual trip to their 60 study plots on Swan's Island, counting the incidence of organisms living not only in the scraped areas but also in areas left in their natural state, the control plots.The current work took advantage of these control plot counts, looking at five common shellfish species: the tortoiseshell limpet (Testudinalia testudinalis), the common periwinkle (Littorina littorea), the dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), and the barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides).""We didn't expect to see much change in the control plots,"" says Petraitis, ""but we were surprised to see these populations declining.""Using abundance data from 1997 to 2018, the researchers found that very young mussels were in the sharpest free fall, declining almost 16% a year, while the other four species were dwindling by 3 to 5% each year. Over that time period, limpets, periwinkles, and dogwhelks declined in total number by 50%, contractions the researchers describe as ""sobering.""To get at the question of why, the researchers looked to data on ocean temperature and chemistry. They found that the downward trajectory of mussels and common periwinkles matched up with increasing summer ocean temperatures collected from a nearby buoy.Meanwhile declines in populations of limpets and dogwhelks corresponded with increases in the aragonite saturation state, a measurement that tracks with ocean pH. This was unexpected, since lower levels of aragonite saturation are associated with more acidic oceanwaters, which make it harder for shellfish to build up their shells. ""This may be indicative of other conditions at nearshore areas that vary with aragonite saturation state,"" Petraitis says.Changes in barnacle numbers did not correspond with changes in ocean temperature, pH, or aragonite saturation state, suggesting other factors are at play in their decline.All five of these species play critical ecological roles in the Gulf of Maine.As filter feeders, mussels and barnacles remove phytoplankton from the water column, ""digesting them, pooping them out, and fertilizing the shore,"" Petraitis says. Limpets and periwinkles feed on algae and seaweed, so smaller numbers could lead to algal blooms and ""greener"" nearshore areas.Since all five species serve as prey for a variety of animals, shrinking populations will reverberate up the food chain, affecting humans as well.""Without animal consumption transferring organic matter up the food web,"" says Dudgeon, ""production in coastal oceans will be increasingly shunted directly through pathways of decomposition by microbial organisms, rather than to support populations of species that humans fish and on which coastal economies depend.""Petraitis also notes the common periwinkle, now emblematic of the coast, was introduced to the Gulf of Maine from Europe sometime in the middle of the 19th century. ""Now it's the most common grazer on the shores -- they feed like goats,"" he says. ""Before 1860, the shore without periwinkles probably looked a lot greener than it does now. As they decline we may see the shore revert back to its state in the 1850s.""While presenting these findings at conferences in the last couple of years, Petraitis says he's heard anecdotes from other scientists about similar disappearances of mussels across the North Atlantic, suggesting the phenomenon is not isolated to the Gulf of Maine.The study was supported by the National Science Foundation (grants OCE-9529564, DEB-0314980, DEB-1020480, and DEB- 1555641).",Climate,2020.0,"A new study in the journal shows that five common shellfish species in the Gulf of Maine are in decline, with very young mussels declining almost 16% per year and the other four species dwindling by 3 to 5% each year.

""It has enabled us to improve the ecological models, and that helps us to make better predictions about nature.""The researchers found that competition between species sets the boundary where species expand their ranges, providing support for including interspecies competition in ecological models and studies that monitor, forecast or manage these changes in the natural world.To achieve this new finding, the researchers used two species of a small, but resilient insect: the flour beetle.Flour beetles have been studied since the early 1900s and are a model organism in ecology. In the same way that fruit flies are used as a model organism for studying genetics, flour beetles can represent the fundamental ecology of most organisms and their responses in the lab can be applied to larger ecological trends and patterns in the natural world.In nature, these tiny creatures live on the ground in the leaf litter and in the bark of trees. While inconspicuous to us, they are common across the world.In the lab, the researchers lined up a series of 1.5 inch-long plexiglass boxes joined by holes, which they could open and close like fences. The two species of flour beetles were born into opposite ends of this lineup, then observed as their populations expanded across the landscape and competed with each other.""It's a microcosm of the larger natural world that allows you to focus in on the core processes of birth, death and movement,"" said Brett Melbourne, senior author on the study and associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.Upon entering Melbourne's laboratory, you might think you are in a bakery -- not a space where scientific experiments are conducted. There is a dusting of flour everywhere and much of the equipment is more what you'd find in a bakery than a lab.""We even sift the flour like you're supposed to when you're baking something,"" said Legault, currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia.Flour is both the flour beetles' habitat and their food source -- but it's also a high-demand human food product. The beetles are considered a major stored product pest, as they can get into not only your cupboards, but grain silos and flour mills. As a result, many studies about these insects focus on exterminating them.But for the researchers, these food pests are perfect for conducting tightly controlled experiments. As the beetles have a short life cycle, observing their populations across many generations can be done within a year.Yet the work is still intensive. In the year of the experiment, 24 CU Boulder undergraduates assisted Legault and Melbourne in counting more than a million beetles.For Melbourne, this research is especially critical in relationship to climate change.""One way that species are experiencing climate change is that their habitat is moving: It's either going up mountain sides or it's moving toward the poles,"" said Melbourne.In many parts of the world, the pace at which habitats are moving in these northern and upward directions across the globe is more than a kilometer per year, according to Melbourne. That is really fast, especially for species with limited ability to change where they live.Predictions on how well a species will survive due to climate change moving their habitat often focus on single, individual species. But as many species migrate to new areas, they will encounter established species that already live there. Because the two species may rely on the same food sources or other resources, the survival of both is threatened.""These kinds of species interactions could be super important for the long-term persistence or extinction of species in response to moving habitats,"" Melbourne said.Additional authors on this paper include Matthew Bitters in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at CU Boulder; and Alan Hastings of the University of California and Santa Fe Institute.",Climate,2020.0,"Competition between species could put some at greater risk of extinction, according to a study by researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder.

On more than one occasion, the majority of all species became extinct and an already highly developed biodiversity shrank to a minimum again, changing the course of evolution each time. The most extensive mass extinction took place about 252 million years ago. It marked the end of the Permian Epoch and the beginning of the Triassic Epoch. About three quarters of all land life and about 95 percent of life in the ocean disappeared within a few thousands of years only.","Gigantic volcanic activities in today's Siberia and the release of large amounts of methane from the sea floor have been long debated as potential triggers of the Permian-Triassic extinction. But the exact cause and the sequence of events that led to the mass extinction remained highly controversial. Now, scientists from Germany, Italy and Canada, in the framework of the EU-funded project BASE-LiNE Earth led by Prof. Dr. Anton Eisenhauer from GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in cooperation with the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, have for the first time been able to conclusively reconstruct the entire cascade of events at that time using cutting-edge analytical techniques and innovative geochemical modelling. The study has been published today in the international journal For their study, the BASE-LiNE Earth team used a previously often neglected environmental archive: the shells of fossil brachiopods. ""These are clam-like organisms that have existed on Earth for more than 500 million years. We were able to use well-preserved brachiopod fossils from the Southern Alps for our analyses.

They found that if all wastepaper was recycled, emissions could increase by 10%, as recycling paper tends to rely more on fossil fuels than making new paper.However, the researchers found that emissions would radically reduce if paper production and disposal were carried out using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels.Making new paper from trees requires more energy than paper recycling, but the energy for this process is generated from black liquor -- the low-carbon by-product of the wood pulping process. In contrast, paper recycling relies on fuels and electricity from the grid.Researchers found that modernising landfill practices, for instance by capturing methane emissions and using them for energy, also had a positive effect -- although not as profound as moving to renewables.Lead author Dr Stijn van Ewijk (UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources and Yale Center for Industrial Ecology) said: ""Our study shows that recycling is not a guaranteed way to address climate change. Recycling of paper may not be helpful unless it is powered by renewable energy.""We looked at global averages, but trends may vary considerably in different parts of the world. Our message isn't to stop recycling, but to point out the risk of investing in recycling at the expense of decarbonising the energy supply and seeing very little change to emissions as a result.""Senior author Professor Paul Ekins (UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources) said: ""The recycling of some materials, for instance metals, can lead to a very large reduction in emissions. But we need to be careful about assumptions that recycling, or a circular economy in general, will always have a positive effect on climate change.""The researchers emphasized that recycling has benefits beyond combatting global warming. Co-author Professor Julia Stegemann (UCL Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering) said: ""Our exponentially increasing consumption of global resources has many seriously damaging environmental impacts beyond climate change, and conserving resources, including by paper recycling, remains critical for sustainability.""The researchers reported that paper accounted for 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. About a third of these emissions came from the disposal of paper in landfills. Researchers said that in coming years, use of paper would likely rise, with the move away from plastics leading to increased demand for paper packaging.The study looked at how different levels of recycling, renewable energy use and more environmentally friendly landfill practices might affect our ability to reduce emissions in line with a target to avoid a 2-degrees Celsius temperature rise by 2050.It found that if past trends continued, emissions would slightly increase from the 2012 level (721 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in a year) to 736 metric tonnes in 2050, with efforts to reduce emissions outweighed by increased demand for paper.A radical programme of recycling, with landfill and energy uses remaining on the same path, would increase this still further by 10% (to 808 metric tonnes), with savings due to a decrease in total energy use outweighed by an increase in the use of high-carbon electricity.On the other hand, radically modernising landfill practices would reduce emissions to 591 metric tonnes, while moving to renewables, with recycling and landfill practices remaining on the standard path, would reduce emissions by 96% to 28 tonnes.Researchers explained that, while paper recycling can save trees and protect forest carbon stocks, the extent of this is unknown. This is because of a lack of understanding of the global forest carbon stock and the interrelated causes of deforestation.

It is also home to threatened humpback and minke whales, chinstrap, Adélie and gentoo penguin colonies, leopard seals, killer whales, seabirds like skuas and giant petrels, and krill -- the bedrock of the Antarctic food chain.","With sea ice covering ever-smaller areas and melting more rapidly due to climate change, many species' habitats have decreased. The ecosystem's delicate balance is consequently tilted, leaving species in danger of extinction.Cumulative threats from a range of human activities including commercial fishing, research activities and tourism combined with climate change is exacerbating this imbalance, and a tipping point is fast approaching.Dr Carolyn Hogg, from the University of Sydney School of Life and Environmental Sciences, was part of the largest ever all-female expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula, with the women in STEMM initiative, Homeward Bound, in late 2019. There, she witnessed the beauty and fragility of the area, and the negative impacts of climate change and human activity on native species, first-hand. As part of the Homeward Bound program she learnt about the science, conservation and governance of Antarctica.In a new commentary piece published in A global initiative, Homeward Bound 'aims to elevate the voices of women in science, technology, engineering mathematics and medicine in leading for positive outcomes for our planet'.Women are noticeably absent in Antarctica's human history, which is steeped in tales of male heroism. Female scientists are still a minority in the region's research stations.""Now, more than ever, a broad range of perspectives is essential in global decision-making, if we are to mitigate the many threats our planet faces,"" said Dr Hogg.""Solutions include the ratification of a Marine Protected Area around the Peninsula, set to be discussed on 19 October, at a meeting of a group of governments that collectively manage the Southern Ocean's resources,"" said Dr Hogg. ""The region is impacted by a number of threats, each potentially problematic in their own right, but cumulated together they will be catastrophic.""The Peninsula's waters are home to 70 percent of Antarctic krill. In addition to climate change, these krill populations are threatened by commercial fishing. Last year marked the third largest krill catch on record. Nearly 400,000 tonnes of this animal were harvested, to be used for omega-3 dietary supplements and fishmeal.""Even relatively small krill catches can be harmful if they occur in a particular region, at a sensitive time for the species that live there,"" said Dr Cassandra Brooks, a co-author on the comment from the University of Colorado, Boulder. ""For example, fishing when penguins are breeding lowers their food intake, and affects their subsequent breeding success. A Marine Protected Area will conserve and protect this unique ecosystem and its wildlife, and we need to implement it now.""Climate change is fundamentally altering the Western Antarctic Peninsula:As sea ice recedes, populations of larval and juvenile krill, which use the ice for shelter and to feed off the algae it attracts, decline.A warmer climate and less sea-ice cover will also give opportunities to invasive species, which can enter the territory via international ships, including those carrying tourists.Tourism's footprint is growing. The Peninsula is the most-visited region in Antarctica, owing to its proximity to South America, dramatic beauty and rich marine ecosystem.Tourist numbers have more than doubled in the past decade, with 74,000 visiting last year compared to 33,000 in 2009.""Ships can pollute the ocean with micro-plastics, oils and ship noise,"" said Dr Justine Shaw, another co-author from the University of Queensland.While the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), a self-regulating association that advocates for safe and environmentally responsible travel, provides guidelines for cruise ships and tourists, ""an increasing number of vessels that are not IAATO members and that carry up to about 500 passengers have begun visiting the region, and this is concerning as it adds greater pressure,"" Dr Shaw said.While the collection of data and knowledge is important, research activities can also potentially damage the Antarctic Peninsula's sensitive environment, the team stated.The Peninsula hosts science facilities belonging to 18 nations -- the highest concentration on the continent. New stations and expansions are ever-present.While these scientific endeavours can increase our understanding of native species', there can be negative impacts on the region if not properly managed. Dr Shaw explained: ""Buildings and infrastructure displace wildlife and vegetation.""The authors endorse a proposed MPA for the western Antarctic Peninsula. Led by Chile and Argentina, this is due to be discussed during a two-week meeting commencing 19 October by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a group of governments that collectively manage the Southern Ocean's resources.The MPA would reduce commercial fishing in ecologically sensitive areas, helping preserve the food chain and ensuring greater sustainability for the future in surrounding areas.A comparable MPA for the Ross Sea, in southern Antarctica, was agreed to in October 2016 to global celebration.Only 1.5 percent of Antarctica's ice-free terrain enjoys formal protected status. Much unprotected land is adjacent to research and tourist areas and is therefore vulnerable to human-generated risks like pollution and invasive species.The authors call for a greater extent and variety of landscapes to be protected.""Globally, parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity have agreed that 17 percent of land should be protected to ensure conservation of biodiversity. This is a good starting point for Antarctica,"" Dr Hogg said.For conservation efforts to be effective, they have to be collaborative. Dr Shaw furnished examples: ""The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) must work to limit the expansion of research infrastructure.

They have built a proof-of-concept device to show this process in action.The device uses a redox-active carbon-absorbing material, sandwiched between two switchable gas gating membranes. The sorbent and the gating membranes are in close contact with each other and are immersed in an organic electrolyte to provide a medium for zinc ions to shuttle back and forth. These two gating membranes can be opened or closed electrically by switching the polarity of a voltage between them, causing ions of zinc to shuttle from one side to the other. The ions simultaneously block one side, by forming a metallic film over it, while opening the other, by dissolving its film away.When the sorbent layer is open to the side where the waste gases are flowing by, the material readily soaks up carbon dioxide until it reaches its capacity. The voltage can then be switched to block off the feed side and open up the other side, where a concentrated stream of nearly pure carbon dioxide is released.By building a system with alternating sections of membrane that operate in opposite phases, the system would allow for continuous operation in a setting such as an industrial scrubber. At any one time, half of the sections would be absorbing the gas while the other half would be releasing it.""That means that you have a feed stream coming into the system at one end and the product stream leaving from the other in an ostensibly continuous operation,"" Hatton says. ""This approach avoids many process issues"" that would be involved in a traditional multicolumn system, in which adsorption beds alternately need to be shut down, purged, and then regenerated, before being exposed again to the feed gas to begin the next adsorption cycle. In the new system, the purging steps are not required, and the steps all occur cleanly within the unit itself.The researchers' key innovation was using electroplating as a way to open and close the pores in a material. Along the way the team had tried a variety of other approaches to reversibly close pores in a membrane material, such as using tiny magnetic spheres that could be positioned to block funnel-shaped openings, but these other methods didn't prove to be efficient enough. Metal thin films can be particularly effective as gas barriers, and the ultrathin layer used in the new system requires a minimal amount of the zinc material, which is abundant and inexpensive.""It makes a very uniform coating layer with a minimum amount of materials,"" Liu says. One significant advantage of the electroplating method is that once the condition is changed, whether in the open or closed position, it requires no energy input to maintain that state. Energy is only required to switch back again.Potentially, such a system could make an important contribution toward limiting emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and even direct-air capture of carbon dioxide that has already been emitted.While the team's initial focus was on the challenge of separating carbon dioxide from a stream of gases, the system could actually be adapted to a wide variety of chemical separation and purification processes, Hatton says.""We're pretty excited about the gating mechanism. I think we can use it in a variety of applications, in different configurations,"" he says. ""Maybe in microfluidic devices, or maybe we could use it to control the gas composition for a chemical reaction. There are many different possibilities.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at MIT have developed a system that can continuously remove carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust streams and ambient air.

A multidisciplinary team from Stockholm University has found evidence of past permafrost thawing during climate warming events at the end of the last ice age. Their findings, published in ","Arctic permafrost stores more carbon than the atmosphere does. When permafrost thaws, this carbon may be converted to greenhouse gases (CO""Our new study shows for the first time the full history of how warming at the end of the last ice age triggered permafrost thawing in Siberia. This also suggests the release of large quantities of greenhouse gases,"" says Jannik Martens, PhD student at Stockholm University and lead author of the study. ""It appears likely that past permafrost thawing at times of climate warming, about 14,700 and 11,700 years ago, was in part also related to the increase in COIn the current study, the scientists used an eight meters long sediment core that was recovered from the sea floor more than 1,000 meters below the surface of the Arctic Ocean during the SWERUS-C3 expedition onboard the Swedish icebreaker Oden back in 2014. To reconstruct permafrost thawing on land, the scientists applied radiocarbon (14C) dating and molecular analysis to trace organic remains that once were released by thawing permafrost and then washed into the Arctic Ocean.""From this core we also learned that erosion of permafrost coastlines was an important driving force for permafrost destruction at the end of the last ice age. Coastal erosion continues to the present day, though ten times slower than during these earlier rapid warming period. With the recent warming trends, however, we see again an acceleration of coastal erosion in some parts of the Arctic, which is expected to release greenhouse gases by degradation of the released organic matter,"" says Örjan Gustafsson, Professor at Stockholm University and leader of the research program. ""Any release from thawing permafrost mean that there is even less room for anthropogenic greenhouse gas release in the earth-climate system budget before dangerous thresholds are reached. The only way to limit permafrost-related greenhouse gas releases is to mitigate climate warming by lowering anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.""Gustafsson, Martens and their colleagues are now again in the Arctic Ocean as part of the International Siberian Shelf Study (ISSS-2020) onboard the Russian research vessel Akademik Keldysh. The expedition left the port of Arkhangelsk on September 26 and is currently in the East Siberian Sea, seeking more answers to how changing climate may trigger release of carbon, including greenhouse gases, from Arctic permafrost systems, including coastal erosion and permafrost below the sea bottom preserved from the past ice age.",Climate,2020.0,"Thawing permafrost in the Arctic could release large amounts of greenhouse gases, according to a study by Stockholm University.

But scientists have also believed rain can erode a landscape quickly enough to essentially 'suck' the rocks out of the Earth, effectively pulling mountains up very quickly.""Both these theories have been debated for decades because the measurements required to prove them are so painstakingly complicated. That's what makes this discovery such an exciting breakthrough, as it strongly supports the notion that atmospheric and solid earth processes are intimately connected.""While there is no shortage of scientific models aiming to explain how the Earth works, the greater challenge can be making enough good observations to test which are most accurate.The study was based in the central and eastern Himalaya of Bhutan and Nepal, because this region of the world has become one of the most sampled landscapes for erosion rate studies. Dr Adams, together with collaborators from Arizona State University (ASU) and Louisiana State University, used cosmic clocks within sand grains to measure the speed at which rivers erode the rocks beneath them.""When a cosmic particle from outer space reaches Earth, it is likely to hit sand grains on hillslopes as they are transported toward rivers. When this happens, some atoms within each grain of sand can transform into a rare element. By counting how many atoms of this element are present in a bag of sand, we can calculate how long the sand has been there, and therefore how quickly the landscape has been eroding,"" Dr Adams said.""Once we have erosion rates from all over the mountain range, we can compare them with variations in river steepness and rainfall. However, such a comparison is hugely problematic because each data point is very difficult to produce and the statistical interpretation of all the data together is complicated.""Dr Adams overcame this challenge by combining regression techniques with numerical models of how rivers erode.""We tested a wide variety of numerical models to reproduce the observed erosion rate pattern across Bhutan and Nepal. Ultimately only one model was able to accurately predict the measured erosion rates,"" Dr Adams said.""This model allows us for the first time to quantify how rainfall affects erosion rates in rugged terrain.""Research collaborator Professor Kelin Whipple, Professor of Geology at ASU, said: ""Our findings show how critical it is to account for rainfall when assessing patterns of tectonic activity using topography, and also provide an essential step forward in addressing how much the slip rate on tectonic faults may be controlled by climate-driven erosion at the surface.""The study findings also carry important implications for land use management, infrastructure maintenance, and hazards in the Himalaya.In the Himalaya, there is the ever-present risk that high erosion rates can drastically increase sedimentation behind dams, jeopardising critical hydropower projects. The findings also suggest greater rainfall can undermine hillslopes, increasing the risk of debris flows or landslides, some of which may be large enough to dam the river creating a new hazard -- lake outburst floods.Dr Adams added: ""Our data and analysis provides an effective tool for estimating patterns of erosion in mountainous landscapes such as the Himalaya, and thus, can provide invaluable insight into the hazards that influence the hundreds of millions of people who live within and at the foot of these mountains.""The research was funded by the Royal Society, the UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the US.Building on this important research, Dr Adams is currently exploring how landscapes respond after large volcanic eruptions.""This new frontier of landscape evolution modelling is also shedding new light on volcanic processes. With our cutting-edge techniques to measure erosion rates and rock properties, we will be able to better understand how rivers and volcanoes have influenced each other in the past,"" Dr Adams said.""This will help us to more accurately anticipate what is likely to happen after future volcanic eruptions and how to manage the consequences for communities living nearby.""",Climate,2020.0,"New research from the University of Bristol has found that more rain can shape mountains by making rivers cut down into rocks faster.

496,16-Oct-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/10/201016132015.htm,"Supercomputing study breaks ground for tree mapping, carbon research","Scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and international collaborators demonstrated a new method for mapping the location and size of trees growing outside of forests, discovering billions of trees in arid and semi-arid regions and laying the groundwork for more accurate global measurement of carbon storage on land.","Using powerful supercomputers and machine learning algorithms, the team mapped the crown diameter -- the width of a tree when viewed from above -- of more than 1.8 billion trees across an area of more than 500,000 square miles, or 1,300,000 square kilometers. The team mapped how tree crown diameter, coverage, and density varied depending on rainfall and land use.Mapping non-forest trees at this level of detail would take months or years with traditional analysis methods, the team said, compared to a few weeks for this study. The use of very high-resolution imagery and powerful artificial intelligence represents a technology breakthrough for mapping and measuring these trees. This study is intended to be the first in a series of papers whose goal is not only to map non-forest trees across a wide area, but also to calculate how much carbon they store -- vital information for understanding the Earth's carbon cycle and how it is changing over time.Carbon is one of the primary building blocks for all life on Earth, and this element circulates among the land, atmosphere, and oceans via the carbon cycle. Some natural processes and human activities release carbon into the atmosphere, while other processes draw it out of the atmosphere and store it on land or in the ocean. Trees and other green vegetation are carbon ""sinks,"" meaning they use carbon for growth and store it out of the atmosphere in their trunks, branches, leaves and roots. Human activities, like burning trees and fossil fuels or clearing forested land, release carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, and rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are a main cause of climate change.Conservation experts working to mitigate climate change and other environmental threats have targeted deforestation for years, but these efforts do not always include trees that grow outside forests, said Compton Tucker, senior biospheric scientist in the Earth Sciences Division at NASA Goddard. Not only could these trees be significant carbon sinks, but they also contribute to the ecosystems and economies of nearby human, animal and plant populations. However, many current methods for studying trees' carbon content only include forests, not trees that grow individually or in small clusters.Tucker and his NASA colleagues, together with an international team, used commercial satellite images from DigitalGlobe, which were high-resolution enough to spot individual trees and measure their crown size. The images came from the commercial QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites. The team focused on the dryland regions -- areas that receive less precipitation than what evaporates from plants each year -- including the arid south side of the Sahara Desert, that stretches through the semi-arid Sahel Zone and into the humid sub-tropics of West Africa. By studying a variety of landscapes from few trees to nearly forested conditions, the team trained their computing algorithms to recognize trees across diverse terrain types, from deserts in the north to tree savannas in the south.The team ran a powerful computing algorithm called a fully convolutional neural network (""deep learning"") on the University of Illinois' Blue Waters, one of the world's fastest supercomputers. The team trained the model by manually marking nearly 90,000 individual trees across a variety of terrain, then allowing it to ""learn"" which shapes and shadows indicated the presence of trees.The process of coding the training data took more than a year, said Martin Brandt, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Copenhagen and the study's lead author. Brandt marked all 89,899 trees by himself and helped supervise training and running the model. Ankit Kariryaa of the University of Bremen led the development of the deep learning computer processing.""In one kilometer of terrain, say it's a desert, many times there are no trees, but the program wants to find a tree,"" Brandt said. ""It will find a stone, and think it's a tree. Further south, it will find houses that look like trees. It sounds easy, you'd think -- there's a tree, why shouldn't the model know it's a tree? But the challenges come with this level of detail. The more detail there is, the more challenges come.""Establishing an accurate count of trees in this area provides vital information for researchers, policymakers and conservationists. Additionally, measuring how tree size and density vary by rainfall -- with wetter and more populated regions supporting more and larger trees -- provides important data for on-the-ground conservation efforts.""There are important ecological processes, not only inside, but outside forests too,"" said Jesse Meyer, a programmer at NASA Goddard who led the processing on Blue Waters. ""For preservation, restoration, climate change, and other purposes, data like these are very important to establish a baseline. In a year or two or ten, the study could be repeated with new data and compared to data from today, to see if efforts to revitalize and reduce deforestation are effective or not. It has quite practical implications.""After gauging the program's accuracy by comparing it to both manually coded data and field data from the region, the team ran the program across the full study area. The neural network identified more than 1.8 billion trees -- surprising numbers for a region often assumed to support little vegetation, said Meyer and Tucker.""Future papers in the series will build on the foundation of counting trees, extend the areas studied, and look ways to calculate their carbon content,"" said Tucker. NASA missions like the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation mission, or GEDI, and ICESat-2, or the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2, are already collecting data that will be used to measure the height and biomass of forests. In the future, combining these data sources with the power of artificial intelligence could open up new research possibilities.""Our objective is to see how much carbon is in isolated trees in the vast arid and semi-arid portions of the world,"" Tucker said. ""Then we need to understand the mechanism which drives carbon storage in arid and semi-arid areas. Perhaps this information can be utilized to store more carbon in vegetation by taking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.""""From a carbon cycle perspective, these dry areas are not well mapped, in terms of what density of trees and carbon is there,"" Brandt said. ""It's a white area on maps. These dry areas are basically masked out. This is because normal satellites just don't see the trees -- they see a forest, but if the tree is isolated, they can't see it. Now we're on the way to filling these white spots on the maps. And that's quite exciting.""",Climate,2020.0,"A team of researchers from NASA and international partners have used artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to map the crown diameter of over 1.8 billion non-forest trees across over 500,000 square miles in Africa.

Scientists do this by using statistics to estimate the increase in the probability of that event that is attributable to climate change. Those statistical measures are closely related to the ""false alarm ratio,"" an important metric used to assess the quality of hazardous weather warnings.But there is a second key metric used to assess the performance of weather forecasters, he argues: The probably that the forecast will correctly warn of events that actually occur, known as the ""probability of detection."" The ideal probability of detection score is 100%, while the ideal false-alarm rate would be zero.Probability of detection has mostly been ignored when it comes to linking extreme events to climate change, he says. Yet both weather forecasting and climate change attribution face a tradeoff between the two. In both weather forecasting and climate-change attribution, calculations in the paper show that raising the thresholds to reduce false alarms produces a much greater drop in the probability of detection.Drawing on a hypothetical example of a tornado forecaster whose false alarm ratio is zero, but is accompanied by a low probability of detection, he writes that such an ""overly cautious tornado forecasting strategy might be argued by some to be smart politics in the context of attributing extreme events to global warming, but it is inconsistent with the way meteorologists warn for a wide range of hazardous weather, and arguably with the way society expects to be warned about threats to property and human life.""Why does this matter? The paper concludes by noting: ""If a forecaster fails to warn for a tornado there may be serious consequences and loss of life, but missing the forecast does not make next year's tornadoes more severe. On the other hand, every failure to alert the public about those extreme events actually influenced by global warming facilitates the illusion that humankind has time to delay the actions required to address the source of that warming. Because the residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere is many hundreds to thousands of years the cumulative consequences of such errors can have a very long lifetime.""",Climate,2020.0,"Dale Durran, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, argues that climate science needs to approach extreme weather events in a way similar to how weather forecasters issue warnings for hazardous weather.

Both are led by Professor Nicholas Bates, BIOS senior scientist and the projects' principal investigator (PI), and Rod Johnson, BIOS assistant scientist and the projects' co-PI. Together, these time-series represent the two longest continuous records of data from the global open ocean.""The four decades of data from BATS and Hydrostation 'S' show that the ocean is not changing uniformly over time and that the ocean carbon sink is not stable over recent time with variability from decade to decade,"" Bates said.Of the two sites, Hydrostation 'S' is the oldest, located approximately 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Bermuda and consisting of repeat biweekly hydrographic observations of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen conducted through the water column since 1954. The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site is located approximately 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Bermuda. It consists of monthly sampling of the physics, chemistry, and biology of the entire water column since 1988. The study's datasets represent more than 1381 cruises to Hydrostation 'S' from 1954 to 2020 and more than 450 cruises to BATS from 1988 to the end of 2019.Results showed that, over the last 40 years, surface temperatures in the Sargasso Sea have increased by 0.85 +/- 0.12oC, with the summer surface temperatures rising at a higher rate than winter. Additionally, the winter (<22°C) ocean state has gotten shorter by almost a month, while the summer season (with waters warmer than 25°C) has gotten longer. During the same period, surface salinity also increased by ~0.11 +/- 0.02. Importantly, these data show evidence of decadal variability; however, during the last decade (2010-2019), rapid warming of 1.18oC and salinification of 0.14 has occurred.The data also show a trend of dissolved oxygen (DO) decline in the Sargasso Sea since the 1980s, representing a loss of ~2% per decade. Given the ocean warming observed in the Sargasso Sea, the researchers estimate that the warming impact on DO solubility would likely have contributed to about 13% of the total decline of DO over the past nearly 40 years. The remaining deoxygenation (~87%) must have resulted from the combined effect of changes in ocean biology and physics.The BATS and Hydrostation 'S' time-series data allow direct detection of the ocean acidification signal in the surface waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The typical pH range of surface waters in the 1980s ranged from wintertime highs of ~8.2 to summertime lows of ~8.08-8.10, with the ocean remaining mildly alkaline at present (~7.98-8.05). The rate of pH change is ~0.0019 +/- 0.0001 year-1, which is a more negative rate than previously reported and represents a 20% increase in hydrogen ion concentration since 1983. These changes were accompanied with significant increases of dissolved inorganic carbon and CO""In forty years, seawater COThe observations off Bermuda reveal the substantial decadal variations and highlight the need for long-term data to determine trends in other ocean physical and biogeochemical properties, particularly when linking local measurements to basin-scale changes.

Two main groups of tetrapods survived, the synapsids and archosaurs, including ancestors of mammals and birds respectively.Palaeontologists had identified indications of warm-bloodedness, or technically endothermy, in these Triassic survivors, including evidence for a diaphragm and possible whiskers in the synapsids.More recently, similar evidence for early origin of feathers in dinosaur and bird ancestors has come to light. In both synapsids and archosaurs of the Triassic, the bone structure shows characteristics of warm-bloodedness. The evidence that mammal ancestors had hair from the beginning of the Triassic has been suspected for a long time, but the suggestion that archosaurs had feathers from 250 million years ago is new.But a strong hint for this sudden origin of warm-bloodedness in both synapsids and archosaurs at exactly the time of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction was found in 2009. Tai Kubo, then a student studying the Masters in Palaeobiology degree at Bristol and Professor Benton identified that all medium-sized and large tetrapods switched from sprawling to erect posture right at the Permian-Triassic boundary.Their study was based on fossilised footprints. They looked at a sample of hundreds of fossil trackways, and Kubo and Benton were surprised to see the posture shift happened instantly, not strung out over tens of millions of years, as had been suggested. It also happened in all groups, not just the mammal ancestors or bird ancestors.Professor Benton said: ""Modern amphibians and reptiles are sprawlers, holding their limbs partly sideways.""Birds and mammals have erect postures, with the limbs immediately below their bodies. This allows them to run faster, and especially further. There are great advantages in erect posture and warm-bloodedness, but the cost is that endotherms have to eat much more than cold-blooded animals just to fuel their inner temperature control.""The evidence from posture change and from early origin of hair and feathers, all happening at the same time, suggested this was the beginning of a kind of 'arms race'. In ecology, arms races occur when predators and prey have to compete with each other, and where there may be an escalation of adaptations. The lion evolves to run faster, but the wildebeest also evolves to run faster or twist and turn to escape.Something like this happened in the Triassic, from 250 to 200 million years ago. Today, warm-blooded animals can live all over the Earth, even in cold areas, and they remain active at night. They also show intensive parental care, feeding their babies and teaching them complex and smart behaviour. These adaptations gave birds and mammals the edge over amphibians and reptiles and in the present cool world allowed them to dominate in more parts of the world.Professor Benton added: ""The Triassic was a remarkable time in the history of life on Earth. You see birds and mammals everywhere on land today, whereas amphibians and reptiles are often quite hidden.""This revolution in ecosystems was triggered by the independent origins of endothermy in birds and mammals, but until recently we didn't realise that these two events might have been coordinated.""That happened because only a tiny number of species survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction -- who survived depended on intense competition in a tough world. Because a few of the survivors were already endothermic in a primitive way, all the others had to become endothermic to survive in the new fast-paced world.""",Climate,2020.0,"The Permian-Triassic mass extinction wiped out up to 95% of life on Earth, but the few survivors included synapsids and archosaurs, the ancestors of mammals and birds, respectively.

At the final conference in Berlin, scientists of the participating research centers presented their results.","Having decided to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, Germany as an industrialized country is facing a tremendous challenge: Organizing a comprehensive and sustainable transformation of the energy system while ensuring stable energy supply for our everyday life, for industry, and for the operation of central communication and transport infrastructures. Within the framework of the research initiative ""Energy System 2050"" (ES2050), scientists of the Helmholtz Association have developed concrete strategies and technical approaches to both improving climate protection and enhancing supply security. These have already been picked up by politics and industry.""Climate-friendly transformation of the energy system requires adequate technologies and clear systemic solutions. Within 'Energy System 2050,' we have not only succeeded in developing them. We have also tested them in real operation and elaborated flexible strategies for their use,"" says Professor Holger Hanselka, coordinator of the research initiative, Research Field Coordinator Energy of the Helmholtz Association, and President of KIT. ""Our research initiative pools the competencies of eight research centers to make the energy transition a success.""Professor Otmar D. Wiestler, President of the Helmholtz Association, says: ""Local, national, and international energy systems have to be switched to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible. This not only is an important step to cope with climate change and increasing degradation of the environment. With the help of regenerative energy systems, we can also produce energy at low costs without being dependent on imports. The 'Energy System 2050' initiative clearly shows which fundamental contributions can be made by the Helmholtz Association in line with its mission to conduct cutting-edge research for solving grand challenges facing society.""The research initiative was launched in 2015 to make a relevant and forward-looking contribution to the transformation of the energy system. 170 scientists conducted research in teams that focused on a piece of the energy transition puzzle each. Based on a systemic analysis of the German energy supply system, they developed economically efficient and climate-friendly transformation paths until 2050. This work was complemented by research into the architecture and security of the future power grid and integration of hydrogen and biogenic energy sources in the energy system. Moreover, power grid components, such as redox flow storage systems, biogas facilities, or gas turbines for the reconversion of synthesis gas and biogas were subjects of studies. Researchers tested the technologies in detail and systemically analyzed their interaction. As a result, the best ""team players"" for sector coupling were found, including technologies to combine heat and power supply. In addition, lifecycle-oriented sustainability analyses were made. Apart from costs and CO2 emissions, such analyses consider other ecological and social factors when producing fuel from biogenic residues, for instance.To carry out dynamic experiments on the system level, the researchers of ES2050 established a large-scale network of research infrastructures, including the Energy Lab 2.0 on the campus of KIT and the Living Lab Energy Campus of Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ). These detailed models of the energy system have meanwhile been equipped with own grid infrastructures and power-to-x facilities, residential buildings, and transport system components. The physical models are closely interlinked with virtual structures for the smart extension of the energy system. With the help of ""digital twins,"" it is possible to integrate system components in experiments, although they do not yet exist -- for instance, the future hydrogen infrastructure. The research initiative understands its modeling tools, datasets, and benchmarks as parts of an open ecosystem and makes them available as open sources. This ""toolkit for the energy transition"" is used by large transmission grid operators already.It is still a long way to go to climate neutrality in the energy sector, but change has started: In 2019, for instance, the share of renewable energy sources in gross power consumption was 42.1 percent, in the year before 37.8 percent, according to the Federal Environment Agency. The results of the research initiative ""Energy System 2050"" can enhance this dynamic trend and extend it to cover the housing, transport, and industry sectors. The research initiative ""Energy System 2050"" was launched by the research field Energy of the Helmholtz Association. The partners are the KIT, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ), the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam (GFZ), the Helmholtz Centre Berlin (HZB), the Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP -- associated), and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ).",Climate,2020.0,"Germany's research initiative ""Energy System 2050"" has developed strategies and technical approaches to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 while ensuring stable energy supply for everyday life, industry, and central communication and transport infrastructures.

Distinct physical, chemical and biological changes to Earth's rock layers began around the year 1950, the research found.","Led by Jaia Syvitski, CU Boulder professor emerita and former director of the Institute of Alpine Arctic Research (INSTAAR), the paper, published today in ""This is the first time that scientists have documented humanity's geological footprint on such a comprehensive scale in a single publication,"" said Syvitski, former executive director of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System, a diverse community of international experts from who study the interactions between the Earth's surface, water and atmosphere.In the past 70 years, humans have exceeded the energy consumption of the entire preceding 11,700 years -- largely through combustion of fossil fuels. This huge increase in energy consumption has then allowed for a dramatic increase in human population, industrial activity, pollution, environmental degradation and climate change.The study is the result of work by the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), an interdisciplinary group of scientists analyzing the case for making the Anthropocene a new epoch within the official Geological Time Scale, characterized by the overwhelming human impact on the Earth.The word Anthropocene follows the naming convention for assigning geologically defined lengths of time and has come to embody the present time during which humans are dominating planetary-scale Earth systems.In geological time, an epoch is longer than an Age but shorter than a Period, measured in tens of millions of years. Within the Holocene epoch, there are several Ages -- but the Anthropocene is proposed as a separate Epoch within Earth's planetary history.""It takes a lot to change the Earth's system,"" said Syvitski. ""Even if we were to get into a greener world where we were not burning fossil fuels, the main culprit of greenhouse gases, we would still have a record of an enormous change on our planet.""The 18 authors of the study compiled existing research to highlight 16 major planetary impacts caused by increased energy consumption and other human activities, spiking in significance around or since 1950.Between 1952 and 1980, humans set off more than 500 thermonuclear explosions above ground as part of global nuclear weapons testing, which have forever left a clear signature of human-caused radionuclides -- atoms with excess nuclear energy -- on or near the surface of the entire planet.Since about 1950, humans have also doubled the amount of fixed nitrogen on the planet through industrial production for agriculture, created a hole in the ozone layer through the industrial scale release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), released enough greenhouse gasses from fossil fuels to cause planetary level climate change, created tens of thousands more synthetic mineral-like compounds than naturally occur on Earth and caused almost one-fifth of river sediment worldwide to no longer reach the ocean due to dams, reservoirs and diversions.Humans have produced so many millions of tons of plastic each year since the middle of the 20th century that microplastics are ""forming a near-ubiquitous and unambiguous marker of Anthropocene,"" according to the study.Not all of these planetary level changes may define the Anthropocene geologically, according to Syvitski and her co-authors, but if present trends continue, they can lead to markers in the rock record that will.Syvitski credits her time as director of INSTAAR from 1995 to 2007 for enabling her to bring together scientists from the different environmental disciplines needed for the study, including geology, biology, geography, anthropology and history.In a similar way, she sees a need for people of different backgrounds and experiences around the world to come together to work toward solutions.""We humans collectively got ourselves into this mess, we need to work together to reverse these environmental trends and dig ourselves out of it,"" said Syvitski. ""Society shouldn't feel complacent. Few people who read the manuscript should come away without emotions bubbling up, like rage, grief and even fear.""",Climate,2020.0,"Humans have caused unprecedented and irreversible changes to the Earth's geology, according to a new study by an interdisciplinary group of scientists.

So far, more than $12 trillion USD have been pledged in such packages. This response is three times larger than the 2008-2009 global financial crisis recovery spending, and represents around 15 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP).A new analysis published today in The Paris Agreement aims to limit the average global temperature rise this century to well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures and to pursue efforts to keep it at 1.5°C. This will require a reduction in the use of fossil fuels, a shift to low-carbon renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind power, and large improvements in energy efficiency.However, current efforts by governments worldwide are insufficient to reach the Paris Agreement goals. Instead, today's policies are leading us towards a world 3°C above pre-industrial averages. These higher temperatures will bring greater risks and more severe impacts, such as droughts, flooding and storms.The new analysis shows that an ambitious path to a 1.5°C world is well within reach if just a fraction of COVID-19 funding is invested in a 'climate-positive' recovery, with the dual aims of stimulating the global economy and accelerating the deployment of low-carbon energy supply and energy efficiency measures. This could be achieved, for example, via direct stimulus and investments as well as via supporting policies such as incentives and rebates.Senior author Dr Joeri Rogelj, from the Grantham Institute -- Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial, said: ""Our findings show that investing in solutions to limit warming to 1.5°C is well within budget. In fact, the increase in low-carbon energy investments required over the next five years to move the world on track to meet the Paris Agreement targets is about eight times smaller than the total current COVID-19 stimulus.""First author Marina Andrijevic, from Climate Analytics and Humboldt University, said: ""If just a fraction of this money was invested in climate-positive recovery plans, the world could achieve net zero carbon energy by mid-century. This is not about diverting money from COVID-19 stimulus or other low-carbon investments in industry, research and development, but providing for the win-win solution of a boosted economy that simultaneously helps our efforts to stall climate change.""Few countries have stated in full detail what they will use their recovery packages for, but immediate priorities will likely be to support healthcare systems, preserve livelihoods and stabilise employment. Beyond these, governments will be looking for investments that can foster economic recovery over the longer term.Several reports, including a survey of over 230 experts worldwide, have shown how a green recovery can support this goal by providing both short- and long-term benefits, including job creation and lowering the investment risk of green technologies.Dr Rogelj added: ""Climate-positive recovery packages provide many benefits governments are looking for to get out of this crisis: they can boost employment and stimulate innovation, thus accelerating the development of technologies required for a global low-carbon transformation.""The team's analysis shows that a climate-positive recovery also needs a strong, near-term focus on actively avoiding a polluting recovery, such as stimulus packages that bail out fossil fuels. Investments in these sectors are poised to continue in the coming years, but there is strong evidence for redirecting this funding to a climate-positive recovery and for supporting the transition by other means, such as reskilling employees.The analysis shows that this will be easier for some countries than others. The US and the European Union have pledged the most in post-pandemic recovery, and also need to invest the least proportionally in low-carbon energy to be on track to reach the Paris Agreement goals. Meanwhile, emerging economies like India have put forward less funding for pandemic recovery, but require proportionally more investments to provide their populations with reliable, clean and affordable energy.Co-author Dr David McCollum, from the Electric Power Research Institute and the University of Tennessee, said: ""The differing situations between developed and emerging economies in these times of crisis remind us of the need to look beyond borders and to collaborate internationally so that a climate-positive recovery benefits everyone, everywhere.""",Climate,2020.0,"Governments worldwide have pledged over $12 trillion USD in stimulus packages to revive the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic, which is three times larger than the recovery spending during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

They found that the amount of carbon stored in soils was the biggest predictor of how much carbon would combust, and that soil moisture was also significant in predicting carbon release.""In these northern forests, soil, not trees, can account for up to 90 percent of carbon emissions, so we expected that these organic soils would be a significant driver,"" said lead author Xanthe Walker of the Center for Ecosystem Science and Society at Northern Arizona University. ""But we were surprised that fire weather and the time of year a fire starts proved to be poor indicators of carbon combustion. It's really about the fuels that are there when a fire starts.""That's a pivotal finding, since fire weather, as measured by a Fire Weather Index, is one of the main tools scientists and fire managers currently use to model carbon emissions in these boreal forests. This study suggests fuels should be a bigger component of those models. ""When we think of climate change and wildfires, we often instinctively think of extreme weather conditions,"" said Marc-André Parisien, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service and co-author of the study. ""But our study shows that vegetation also matters -- a lot! Predicting future vegetation is a tough nut to crack, but this study emphasizes the need to keep chipping away at it.""The vegetation patterns they uncovered were complex -- soil moisture, tree species composition, and stand age at the time of fire all interacted to predict combustion amounts. For instance, highly flammable black spruce was generally a predictor of carbon combustion, and the presence of this species increased with site moisture and stand age at the time of fire. But such interactions are likely to change with the climate. For example, as the climate warms and fire intervals shorten, black spruce stands are being replaced by deciduous trees and jack pine, which grow in shallower soils that release less carbon during fires. The site-level resolution of the study allowed the researchers to capture such dynamism in carbon combustion patterns, and offers clues about the way they may shift in the future.""We really need to move beyond the misconception of the boreal forest as a monotonous stretch of forest,"" said Sander Veraverbeke, assistant professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and co-author of the study.

""It encompasses attention and emotional and cognitive engagement with the story. It is the idea that you are transported into the story, or to another time or place while consuming the story.""""Democrats started with higher-risk perceptions and efficacy beliefs in regard to climate change when compared to Republicans, but after watching the video, among participants who were most transported or engaged, that difference went away,"" she said.Bieniek-Tobasco and colleagues say their findings suggest that the messages used to persuade audiences can be very effective in influencing climate change attitudes and beliefs if the content is engaging.""Narrative transportation predicts efficacy beliefs and risk perceptions and appears to reduce political polarization in climate change attitudes and beliefs,"" she said. ""This tells us that engaging storytelling is potentially a powerful tool for combating polarization. If used in the right way, it may also catalyze changes in political behaviors needed to build political will to implement policy solutions to address climate change, and ultimately protect our health.""This research, which was conducted by Bieniek-Tobasco under a research protocol at George Washington University, was funded in part by a grant from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.",Climate,2020.0,"Watching the Emmy Award-winning documentary ""Years of Living Dangerously"" can reduce political polarization in climate change attitudes, according to a study in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.

By measuring the titanium concentration in the different layers, scientists can estimate the relative temperature and atmospheric pressure over time.The newly extended record shows that the coldest temperatures were found between about 1400-1600 A.D., and the warmest interval occurred during just the past decade, the authors report. Francus adds, ""Our unique data set constitutes the first reconstruction of Atlantic sea surface temperatures spanning the last 3,000 years and this will allow climatologists to better understand the mechanisms behind long-term changes in the behavior of the Atlantic Ocean.""When temperatures are cool over the North Atlantic, a relatively low atmospheric pressure pattern is found over much of the Canadian High Arctic and Greenland. This is associated with slower snow melt in that region and higher titanium levels in the sediments. The opposite is true when the ocean is warmer -- atmospheric pressure is higher, snow melt is rapid and the concentration of titanium decreases.Lapointe says, ""Using these strong links, it was possible to reconstruct how Atlantic sea surface temperatures have varied over the past 2,900 years, making it the longest record that is currently available."" Details appear this week in The researchers report that their newly reconstructed record is significantly correlated with several other independent sediment records from the Atlantic Ocean ranging from north of Iceland to offshore Venezuela, confirming its reliability as a proxy for the long-term variability of ocean temperatures across a broad swath of the Atlantic. The record is also similar to European temperatures over the past 2,000 years, they point out.Fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), are also linked to other major climatic upheavals such as droughts in North America and the severity of hurricanes. However, because measurements of sea surface temperatures only go back a century or so, the exact length and variability of the AMO cycle has been poorly understood.Climate warming in the Arctic is now twice or three times faster than the rest of the planet because of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, warming can be amplified or dampened by natural climate variability, such as changes in the surface temperature of the North Atlantic, which appear to vary over cycles of about 60-80 years.Lapointe, who has carried out extensive fieldwork in the Canadian Arctic over the past decade, notes that ""It has been common in recent summers for atmospheric high-pressure systems -- clear-sky conditions -- to prevail over the region. Maximum temperatures often reached 20 degrees Celsius, 68 degrees Fahrenheit, for many successive days or even weeks, as in 2019. This has had irreversible impacts on snow cover, glaciers and ice caps, and permafrost.""Bradley adds that, ""The surface waters of the Atlantic have been consistently warm since about 1995. We don't know if conditions will shift towards a cooler phase any time soon, which would give some relief for the accelerated Arctic warming. But if the Atlantic warming continues, atmospheric conditions favoring more severe melting of Canadian Arctic ice caps and the Greenland ice sheet can be expected in the coming decades.""In 2019, Greenland Ice Sheet lost more than 500 billion tons of mass, a record, and this was associated with unprecedented, persistent high pressure atmospheric conditions.""Lapointe notes, ""Conditions like this are currently not properly captured by global climate models, underestimating the potential impacts of future warming in Arctic regions.""",Climate,2020.0,"Scientists from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and University of Québec-INRS have reconstructed the longest record of Atlantic sea surface temperatures, spanning 2,900 years.

Reusable and single-use plastic bags would be a comparatively better environmental option only in these cities, due to the model's focus on densely populated metropolitan areas that have waste management structures with similar end-of-life incineration facilities.The findings were published in the scientific Assistant Professor Grzegorz Lisak, Director of Residues & Resource Reclamation Centre at the Nanyang Environment and Water Institute (NEWRI), who led the research, said: ""Our main message is that re-usable plastic bags are the best option, provided that they are re-used many times -- over 50 times to be precise. However, one surprising conclusion is that, in our model, in a single-use case, plastic bags, if treated properly afterwards, are less environmentally detrimental than the other types of bags in this study.""""It is essential to evaluate the implications case by case for dealing with plastic waste. In a well-structured closed metropolitan waste management system with incineration treatment, using plastic bags may be the best option that is currently available, provided that there is no significant leakage of waste into the environment.""To reach their conclusions, the team carried out a life cycle analysis of five types of bags to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with their production, distribution, transportation, waste collection, treatment, and end-of-life disposal.The research team found that the global warming potential of a single-use kraft paper bag was the highest, over 80 times that of reusable plastic bags. Single-use plastic and reusable cotton bags (reused 50 times) were calculated to have over ten times the global warming potential of reusable plastic bags (reused 50 times).To offset the emission equivalent to equal that of the creation of one single-use plastic bag, a reusable plastic bag would need to be reused four times.The team also observed that the relative negative environmental impacts of cotton and kraft paper bags in the model are due to their production processes that consume immense amounts of water and natural resources. Hence, improving the production methods, optimizing resource usage, and following sustainable practices could in future favour the usage of bags made from cotton and paper.In the case of Singapore, the team recommends the usage of reusable plastic bags to the greatest extent possible to reduce consumption of single-use plastic bags. Reprocessing single-use plastic bags would be a good policy goal to cut down on their environmental impact.Asst Prof Lisak said that based on 2018 statistics in Singapore, reducing the single-use plastic grocery bag consumption by half could prevent over 10 million kg-CO2 equivalent emissions in a year.Moving forward, the team will be embarking on further studies connected to plastic waste management, waste plastic upgrading and the development of new products",Climate,2020.0,"A study by researchers at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore has found that reusable plastic bags made from polypropylene non-woven plastic are the most environmentally friendly option, followed by single-use plastic bags.

In a first step, modern humans settled along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Only then did they spread out into the Sinai desert and the eastern Jordanian Rift Valley. This is the result of archaeological research conducted by Collaborative Research Centre 'Our Way to Europe' (CRC 806) at the universities of Cologne, Bonn, and Aachen. The article 'Al-Ansab and the Dead Sea: mid-MIS 3 Archaeology and Environment of the Early Ahmarian Population of the Levantine Corridor' was published in ","For more than ten years, the team has been analysing sediments, pollen, and archaeological artefacts around the site of Al-Ansab 1 near the ancient ruin-city of Petra (Jordan). The goal was to gain an understanding of the environmental conditions that prevailed at the time of human expansion. 'Human presence consolidated in the region under favourable climate conditions', said Professor Dr Jürgen Richter, lead author of the study.The success story of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa began about 100,000 years ago with well-known sites such as Qafzeh and Skhul in Israel. However, these early records only reveal a brief, temporary expansion of the territory into the Levant. Permanent settlement of the region only dates back to about 43,000 years ago, scientists believe. During the epoch of the so-called 'Early Ahmarian', modern humans gradually had been spreading throughout the Levant -- a first step on their way to Asia and Europe.Favourable climatic conditions were preconditions for permanent human settlement. On a large scale, this is illustrated by the presence of the so-called Lake Lisan. This freshwater lake was located where the Dead Sea is today. However, it was of a much larger extent and carried greater water volume. Most of the water evaporated only with the end of the last ice age, leaving behind the hypersaline Dead Sea known today.Even on a small scale, the scientists were able to recognise the favourable environmental conditions: geo-archaeological teams from the University of Cologne and RWTH Aachen University examined the site of Al-Ansab 1. Whereas today, the Wadi Sabra, in which the site is located, is strongly shaped by seasonal flash floods, geomorphological and archaeological investigations showed that at the time of settlement, the conditions were less erosive and continuously wet, permitting the presence of humans.'This enabled the spread of humans from the coastal Mediterranean area to the formerly drier regions of the Negev desert and the eastern slopes of the Jordan Rift Valley. They hunted gazelles in the open landscape -- a prey we found in many sites in the region from this period', says Richter. 'Humans did not come by steady expansion out of Africa through the Levant and further to Europe and Asia. Rather, they first settled in a coastal strip along the Mediterranean Sea.'The region around the site of Al-Ansab 1 therefore was a stepping stone on Homo sapiens' way -- a journey that did not take a straight path to the European continent, but was guided by complex interactions between humans and their environment.",Climate,2020.0,"Scientists have gained insight into the environmental conditions that allowed humans to settle in the Levant region, including the area around Petra in Jordan.

Pikas typically live in cool habitats, often in mountains, under rocks and boulders. Because pikas are sensitive to high temperatures, some researchers predict that, as the Earth's temperature rises, pikas will have to move ever higher elevations until they eventually run out of habitat and die out. Some scientists have claimed this cute little herbivore is the proverbial canary in the coal mine for climate change.","A new extensive review by Arizona State University emeritus professor Andrew Smith, published in the October issue of the Smith has studied the American pika for more than 50 years and presents evidence from a thorough literature review showing that American pika populations are healthy across the full range of the species, which extends from British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, to northern New Mexico in the U.S.Occupancy in potential pika habitat in the major western North American mountains was found to be uniformly high. Among sites that have been surveyed recently, there was no discernible climate signal that discriminated between the many occupied and relatively few unoccupied sites.""This is a sign of a robust species,"" Smith said.Smith said most of the studies that have raised alarms about the fate of the pika are based on a relatively small number of restricted sites at the margins of the pika's geographic range, primarily in the Great Basin. However, a recent comprehensive study of pikas evaluating 3,250 sites in the Great Basin found pikas living in over 73% of the suitable habitat investigated. Most important, the sites currently occupied by pikas and the sites where they are no longer found were characterized by similar climatic features.""These results show that pikas are able to tolerate a broader set of habitat conditions than previously understood,"" Smith adds.Smith's most interesting finding is that pikas are apparently much more resilient than previously believed, allowing them to survive even at hot, low-elevation sites. Bodie California State Historic Park, the Mono Craters, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Lava Beds National Monument, and the Columbia River Gorge (all hot, low-elevation sites) retain active pika populations, demonstrating the adaptive capacity and resilience of pikas. Pikas cope with warm temperatures by retreating into their cool, underground talus habitat during the hot daylight hours and augment their restricted daytime foraging with nocturnal activity.This doesn't mean that some pika populations have not been pushed to their limit, leading to their disappearance from some habitats. Smith's review points out that most documented cases of local loss of pika populations have occurred on small, isolated habitat patches.""Due to the relatively poor ability of pikas to disperse between areas, those habitats are not likely to be recolonized, particularly in light of our warming climate,"" Smith said. ""In spite of the general health of pikas across their range, these losses represent a one-way street, leading to a gradual loss of some pika populations. Fortunately for pikas, their preferred talus habitat in the major mountain cordilleras is larger and more contiguous, so the overall risk to this species is low.""Smith's work emphasizes the importance of incorporating all aspects of a species' behavior and ecology when considering its conservation status, and that all available data must be considered before suggesting a species is going extinct. For the American pika, the data conclusively show that rather than facing extinction, American pikas are changing their behaviors in ways that help them better withstand climate change, at least for now.",Climate,2020.0,"A review by Arizona State University professor Andrew Smith has found that American pika populations are healthy across their full range, from British Columbia to northern New Mexico.

The 2020 monsoon season was the second-driest on record, and many high-profile wildfires swept across the Sonoran Desert and surrounding sky islands. Putting an end to severe fires may only become harder as climate change makes monsoon storms less frequent and more extreme, say the authors of a new study published in the The U.S. may be able to learn from Mexico's wildfire management strategy, the researchers say.""These large fire years are the result of many factors, but fire weather and seasonal climate loom very large in the picture. In the case of (Tucson's) Bighorn Fire (this summer), for example, we had a combination of unusually hot weather, low humidity and strong winds. When the monsoon is delayed, that means the fire season lasts longer, giving fires more time to burn,"" said study co-author Don Falk, professor in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment.""It's well-known that what really gets us through May and June in Arizona is winter rainfall and snowpack. It adds moisture to the system,"" said lead study author Alexis Arizpe, who was a UArizona research specialist and graduate student in the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research when he did the research. ""The start of the fire season is controlled by winter rain, but the monsoon controls the end of it. The physical rainfall limits fire with deceased temperatures, increased humidity and soil moisture.""Arizpe, who is now a technician at the Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology in Vienna, Austria, and his colleagues analyzed patterns of widespread fire years going back more than 400 years using tree-ring samples extracted from sky island mountain ranges -- isolated mountaintops that are ecologically distinct from the surrounding valleys -- in southern Arizona and northern Mexico.""Realistically, there's only one factor that could give you simultaneous large fires in multiple sky islands, and that's climate,"" Falk said. ""We now understand that the sky island bioregion has a distinctive 'monsoon fire regime' different from anywhere else.""Connie Woodhouse, a Regents Professor in the School of Geography, Development and Environment, and Tom Swetnam, Regents Professor Emeritus of Dendrochronology, were also co-authors on the study.Researchers have learned about the monsoon's role in regulating wildfires from records of past fires, but they didn't have the ability to assess it over long periods, Falk said. That recently changed when former Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research graduate student Daniel Griffin, now on the faculty at the University of Minnesota, compiled the first-ever tree-ring record that teased out monsoon rainfall from winter rainfall.When the team sorted out the interactions between winter and monsoon rainfall and wildfires, interesting relationships emerged.""When it's wet in both seasons, you never get a big fire,"" Falk said. ""When it's wet in winter and dry in the monsoon, you see fire occasionally. When it's dry in winter but a good monsoon, every now and then you get some big fires. But the real action is when it's dry in both seasons. Think of it as how much time fires have to burn.""Also, heavy winter rainfall promotes fuel buildup. When a wet winter is followed by an especially dry year, there's a lot of built-up fuel, such as dry grass, that's primed for lightning strikes or stray sparks.Another pattern emerged in the data: Large, high-severity fires burn more often in the U.S. than in Mexico. This is mostly due to land management differences, Arizpe said. In many areas of Mexico, traditional land management practices continue. This includes seasonal grazing combined with local prescribed burning to renew grasslands, allowing low-severity fires to burn naturally as they have for centuries.In contrast, for the last 100 years, the U.S. Forest Service has focused heavily on fire suppression, meaning fires are snuffed out as soon as possible. As a result, fuels accumulate, providing fuel for more severe fires later, Falk said. Currently, nearly half of the U.S. Forest Service's budget funds fire suppression. As a result, the U.S. hadn't experienced many destructive wildfires until droughts of the 21st century produced unmitigated fuel for some of the largest wildfires the region has ever seen.""Ironically, our investment is paying off in the form of gigantic fires that threaten our forests,"" Falk said.Using the tree-ring record, the team found that for centuries, low-intensity wildfires scarred but didn't kill trees about once every 10 years. This natural process is healthy for the regional ecosystem. Small fires that stay low to the ground clear up dead foliage on the forest floor and turn it into nutritious ash from which new plants can grow.Larger, more destructive fires cause public outcry that triggers a cycle that exacerbates the problem, Falk said. Fire suppression tactics allow fuels to accumulate. More fuel means more highly destructive fires and more public outcry. As a result, policy makers pour more money into suppression to protect human assets like towns and power lines.Such large, destructive fires do much more than scar trees. High severity fires can leave large landscapes with damaged soils and few living trees. It can take decades or even centuries for the ecosystem to recover, which can be detrimental to native species. In the meantime, erosions and landslides may occur.Climate change researchers predict that the region will only get hotter and drier as climate change progresses, resulting in more common and devastating wildfires, said Christopher Castro, associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences, who was not involved with the research.Castro uses climate models to forecast future monsoons. His research shows that monsoon storms will become more intense but less frequent. This could also possibly delay the end of the wildfire season.""This is all bad from a wildfire perspective,"" he said.Mexico, on the other hand, has let fires naturally run their course relative to the U.S. As a result, they have relatively more natural and less destructive wildfire patterns, although large fires have occurred there as well, Falk said.""Looking forward, we have to accept the new reality that fire seasons will be longer and more severe in the future. This is simply the new world that we have created for ourselves and for nature by propelling climate change so rapidly,"" Falk said. ""Managers will have a massive challenge on their hands dealing with this new reality, but certainly in the short run we need to provide them with the means to manage forests more proactively, including forest thinning, prescribed burning and other measures to reduce fuels.""",Climate,2020.0,"Climate change is making monsoon storms less frequent and more extreme, which may make putting an end to severe wildfires in the Sonoran Desert and surrounding sky islands harder, according to a study.

""And we know that things are going to be very different along our coasts in the coming years.""In 2019, Becker and graduate student Benjamin Sweeney surveyed 85 engineers at consulting firms, port authorities and government agencies with experience working on port infrastructure projects in the United States.

It found that 54% of respondents said they often or always factor in rising sea levels because it is required by their client, and 46% indicated they do so because it is a regulatory requirement.More than half of the respondents also said that ""a lack of design standards"" was the chief barrier to incorporating sea level rise into their infrastructure projects. Other answers included a lack of funding, the client doesn't want sea level rise incorporated, and concerns over the uncertainty of sea level rise projections.""Regulatory standards and codes remove the burden on engineers to make subjective sea level rise decisions,"" Becker and Sweeney wrote. ""This barrier also renders many of the other barriers less relevant.""Based on the results of the survey, Becker and Sweeney recommend that engineers undertake a life cycle cost analysis that includes sea level rise projections for each project. This methodology can be used to support decision making for climate change adaptation alternatives.They also suggest that the engineering community collaborate with port authorities and regulatory bodies to create design standards to improve the resilience of port infrastructure.""Engineers need something they can rely on so they can go to their clients and say, 'this is what we need to follow, and it's not optional,'"" Becker said. ""The guidance also has to be flexible enough so it can be adapted over time as conditions change, but it gives them something they can hang their hat on today.""",Climate,2020.0,"A survey of 85 engineers at consulting firms, port authorities, and government agencies in the US found that 64% do not have a policy or planning document to guide how to incorporate sea level change into their designs.

518,13-Oct-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/10/201013124129.htm,Mental accounting is impacting sustainable behavior,"Mental accounting is a concept that describes the mental processes we employ to organise our resource use. Human beings tend to create separate mental budget compartments where specific acts of consumption and payments are linked. This mechanism can be counter-productive when it comes to energy consumption and can have a negative impact on attempts to reduce carbon emissions. Psychologists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), working in collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Western Switzerland (HES-SO Valais), have published a perspective in the highly influential journal ","Mental accounting, a concept known by psychology researchers since the 1980s, describes how the human mind functions when performing acts of consumption. For instance, someone who has bought a cinema ticket in advance but who cannot find it on entering the cinema will typically not buy a second ticket: their film budget has already been spent! This example illustrates our tendency to mentally segment our budgets and link them to specific acts of consumption. ""These basic cognitive mechanisms can help us better understand unsustainable behaviour. If they are taken into account, they could be used to fine-tune the way policy instruments are designed to fight climate change, improve prevention and promote sustainable behaviour,"" begins Tobias Brosch, professor in psychology of sustainable development at UNIGE's Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences and the Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences. ""For this article, we used the currently ongoing discussions around the carbon tax to illustrate the impact of three mechanisms of mental accounting on behaviour and to propose ways to circumvent this impact.""The spillover effect refers to the fact that we tend to justify one behaviour by another of our behaviours. ""Someone who makes the effort to cycle to work every day will use this argument to justify, to himself or others, buying a plane ticket to go on holiday to the Seychelles. A possible intervention strategy to prevent this is to encourage people to create differentiated mental accounts using targeted messages,"" states the psychologist.The rebound effect explains how actions can induce a negative energy balance when people fail to adapt their budgets to a new situation. For example, people who buy an energy-efficient car may feel inclined to use it more often, cancelling out potential energy savings. To tackle this phenomenon, the psychologists suggest informing people about the real energy costs of their new car so they can update their consumption budget.Our minds create mental accounts with precise labels. The mental account that is opened when we receive a sum of money in a specific context determines what the money will be spent on. ""A monetary gift received for a birthday will be labelled 'pleasure', and will most likely be spent on pleasurable experiences,"" says Professor Brosch by means of illustration. This can be problematic in the context of sustainable decision-making. For instance, the financial returns on solar panels installed at home appear only indirectly in the electricity bill and are not explicitly labelled as ""energy saving."" Accordingly, people will not necessarily think about reinvesting this money in new sustainable measures. ""Clear labels are needed. In Switzerland, part of the carbon levy is returned to citizens via a reduction in health insurance costs. It would be better to label such an income 'Climate action revenue',"" argues Tobias Brosch.The analysis carried out by the psychologists proposes concrete measures aimed at the political sphere so that pro-climate initiatives can be improved by factoring in human behaviour. ""We need to clearly show the price of energy, make the message salient, and demonstrate the impact of consumption on COThe approaches developed in the perspective help conceptualise spending and diversify mental accounts so that individuals can better adapt their behaviours. But Hahnel warns: ""Be careful to consider your values and not to fall into purely marketing-based initiatives. You cannot put sustainability labels on just any tax credit."" ""Bounded rationality, including mental accounting, can help introducing innovative policies for climate change mitigation in addition to price-oriented ones"" adds Valentino Piana, senior economist at HES-SO, who contributed to the study. Professor Brosch concludes in the same tone: ""Our work helps to understand behaviour, how humans make choices and take decisions. Our goal isn't to abolish free will, but to provide a behavioural toolbox. Policymakers can use this knowledge to develop strategies based not just on scientific evidence, but also on ethical considerations.""",Climate,2020.0,"Mental accounting, a concept known by psychology researchers since the 1980s, describes how the human mind functions when performing acts of consumption, and can help to better understand unsustainable behaviour. The spillover effect, rebound effect, and mental accounts with precise labels are three mechanisms that can impact behaviour and should be taken into account when designing policy instruments to fight climate change, improve prevention, and promote sustainable behaviour. The psychologists suggest informing people about the real energy costs of their purchases, encouraging people to create differentiated mental accounts using targeted messages, and labelling income from pro-climate initiatives more clearly. Policymakers can use this knowledge to develop strategies",,

According to the study authors, this increase is consistent with warming trends in the shallow ocean associated with anthropogenic climate change, but more research is needed to understand what is driving rising temperatures in the deep ocean.""In years past, everybody used to assume the deep ocean was quiescent. There was no motion. There were no changes,"" said Chris Meinen, an oceanographer at the NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and lead author of the new study. ""But each time we go look we find that the ocean is more complex than we thought.""Researchers today are monitoring the top 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) of the ocean more closely than ever before, in large part due to an international program called the Global Ocean Observing System. Devices called Argo floats that sink and rise in the upper ocean, bobbing along in ocean currents, provide a rich trove of continuous data on temperature and salinity.The deep sea, however, is notoriously difficult to access and expensive to study. Scientists typically take its temperature using ships that lower an instrument to the seafloor just once every ten years. This means scientists' understanding of the day-to-day changes in the bottom half of the ocean lag far behind their knowledge of the surface.Meinen is part of a team at NOAA carrying out a rare long-term study at the bottom of the ocean, but until recently, the team thought the four devices they had moored at the bottom of the Argentine Basin were just collecting information on ocean currents. Then Meinen saw a study by the University of Rhode Island showcasing a feature of the device he had been completely unaware of. A temperature sensor was built into the instrument's pressure sensor used to study currents and had been incidentally collecting temperature data for the entirety of their study. All they had to do was analyze the data they already had.""So we went back and we calibrated all of our hourly data from these instruments and put together what is essentially a continuous 10-year-long hourly record of temperature one meter off the seafloor,"" Meinen said.The researchers found at the two shallower depths of 1,360 and 3,535 meters (4,460 feet and 11,600 feet), temperatures fluctuated roughly monthly by up to a degree Celsius. At depths below 4,500 meters (14,760 feet), temperature fluctuations were more minute, but changes followed an annual pattern, indicating seasons still have a measurable impact far below the ocean surface. The average temperature at all four locations went up over the course of the decade, but the increase of about 0.02 degrees Celsius per decade was only statistically significant at depths of over 4,500 meters.According to the authors, these results demonstrate that scientists need to take the temperature of the deep ocean at least once a year to account for these fluctuations and pick up on meaningful long-term trends. In the meantime, others around the world who have used the same moorings to study deep sea ocean currents could analyze their own data and compare the temperature trends of other ocean basins.""There are a number of studies around the globe where this kind of data has been collected, but it's never been looked at,"" Meinen said. ""I'm hoping that this is going to lead to a reanalysis of a number of these historical datasets to try and see what we can say about deep ocean temperature variability.""A better understanding of temperature in the deep sea could have implications that reach beyond the ocean. Because the world's oceans absorb so much of the world's heat, learning about the ocean's temperature trends can help researchers better understand temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere as well.""We're trying to build a better Global Ocean Observing System so that in the future, we're able to do better weather predictions,"" Meinen said. ""At the moment we can't give really accurate seasonal forecasts, but hopefully as we get better predictive capabilities, we'll be able to say to farmers in the Midwest that it's going to be a wet spring and you may want to plant your crops accordingly.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has found that the deep ocean is warming at a significant rate of 0.02 to 0.04 degrees Celsius per decade between 2009 and 2019.

Pencil in ""another Dust Bowl in the Great Plains."" A study from University of Utah researchers and their colleagues finds that atmospheric dust levels are rising across the Great Plains at a rate of up to 5% per year.","The trend of rising dust parallels expansion of cropland and seasonal crop cycles, suggesting that farming practices are exposing more soil to wind erosion. And if the Great Plains becomes drier, a possibility under climate change scenarios, then all the pieces are in place for a repeat of the Dust Bowl that devastated the Midwest in the 1930s.""We can't make changes to the earth surface without some kind of consequence just as we can't burn fossil fuels without consequences,"" says Andy Lambert, lead author of the study and a recent U graduate. ""So while the agriculture industry is absolutely important, we need to think more carefully about where and how we plant.""The research is published in In the 1930s, a drought blanketed the Great Plains, from Mexico to Canada. This wouldn't have been such a big deal except that in the 1920s Midwestern farmers had converted vast tracts of grassland into farmland using mechanical plows. When the crops failed in the drought the open areas of land that used to be covered by grass, which held soil tightly in place, were now bare dirt, vulnerable to wind erosion.""The result was massive dust storms that we associate with the Dust Bowl,"" Lambert says. ""These dust storms removed nutrients from the soil, making it more difficult for crops to grow and more likely for wind erosion to occur."" After years of drought, dust and hardship, rain finally began to fall again, bringing the Dust Bowl to a close.""But the damage was already done to the soil,"" Lambert says. ""Some areas have still not fully recovered.""Around the 2000s, the growth in demand for biofuels spurred renewed expansion of farmland to produce the needed crops. In an echo of the 1920s, this expansion replaced stable grasslands with vulnerable soil. Over five years, from 2006 to 2011, 2046 square miles (530,000 hectares) of grassland in five Midwestern states became farmland -- an area a little smaller than Delaware.At the same time, parts of the Great Plains experienced longer and more severe droughts in the 20th century. The future of drought in that region is, so far, uncertain, but the potential for a warmer, drier Great Plains has Lambert and co-author Gannet Hallar, associate professor of atmospheric sciences, bringing up the word ""desertification"" in relation to the potential future of the region.The focus of the study by Lambert, Hallar and colleagues from the U, the University of Colorado-Boulder and Colorado State University, was to quantify how much the amount of dust in the atmosphere over the Great Plains had changed in recent decades. To do that, they tapped into instrumentation that measures atmospheric haziness from the ground up and from space down. From the ground, the IMPROVE monitoring network is run by several federal agencies and measures the amount of particulate matter in the air at sites, including national parks, around the country. Another ground-based network, the NASA-run AERONET, watches for how much incoming sunlight is blocked by dust and aerosol particles in the air. From space, an instrument called MODIS does the same job, looking at how much light reflected from the surface is similarly blocked by particles.All together, the data cover years from 1988 to 2018. Dust, they found, is increasing in the atmosphere over the whole of the Great Plains by as much as 5% per year.""The amount of increase is really the story here,"" Hallar says. ""That 5% a year over two decades, of course, is a hundred percent increase in dust loading. This is not a small signal to find.""The researchers further found correlations between dust in the atmosphere and crop timings. In Iowa, where soybeans have been a major expanding crop, increases in dust appeared in June and October -- planting and harvesting months, respectively, for soybeans. In the southern Great Plains states, where corn is a more dominant crop, dust increases appeared in March and October -- again correlating to corn planting and harvesting seasons.That was remarkable,"" Hallar says, ""in the sense of how clear the signal was.""""I think it's fair to say that what's happening with dust trends in the Midwest and the Great Plains is an indicator that the threat is real if crop land expansion continues to occur at this rate and drought risk does increase because of climate change,"" Lambert says. ""Those would be the ingredients for another Dust Bowl.""""This is an example of the need for the agricultural community in the U.S. to think about adapting and mitigating to a changing climate,"" Hallar says. ""So if we become more arid we will need to think about the impacts of land degradation in that changed climate. What we did in the past isn't necessarily what we can do in the future.""",Climate,2020.0,"Farming practices that expose more soil to wind erosion are causing an increase in dust in the atmosphere over the Great Plains, according to a study by researchers from the University of Utah, Colorado State University and the University of Colorado-Boulder.

522,13-Oct-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/10/201013105813.htm,Unique view into the new Arctic,"With the return of the Polarstern, the largest Arctic expedition of all times has come to a successful end. For more than a year, the German research icebreaker travelled in 5 cruise legs with more than 400 people from 20 countries to investigate the epicentre of climate change more precisely than ever before. At the end of the expedition, which cost around 140 million euros, the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), came to a positive conclusion: despite all the unforeseeable difficulties, it had succeeded in advancing knowledge about the Earth's climate system and its changes by a decisive step.","From Leipzig's point of view, the complex project was also successful: all 7 participants from the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) and the Leipzig University are back in good health and with valuable climate data. Two measurement programmes that are central to research into the Arctic atmosphere were able to be carried out in full despite weather extremes and corona: A multi-wavelength lidar scanned the air layers above Polarstern during the entire expedition. In 369 days, 640 million laser pulses went into the sky and 112 gigabytes of data were collected. In July, the MOSAiC atmosphere team was able to measure the lowest air layer above the melting ice floe with a captive balloon. Within a tight time window, 33 balloon ascents were achieved, during which a total of 31725 metres of rope were unwound and rewound. The balloon measurements by TROPOS and Leipzig University are particularly important for understanding the polar atmosphere during the melting phase, because the measurements originally planned in parallel with aircraft from Spitsbergen had to be postponed until autumn due to the corona pandemic.""We are pleased that the ambitious plans have essentially been realised despite all the difficulties. A highlight are definitely the insights into the troposphere at the North Pole during the winter with our lidar. Nobody has ever been able to observe it so far north during the polar night off MOSAiC,"" says Prof. Andreas Macke, Director of TROPOS. The evaluation of the data is still in full swing, but there are indications that the same applies to the atmosphere as to the ice on the ground: ""There are many indications that the atmosphere of the Arctic has already changed significantly. We have seen more smoke than expected. The huge forest fires are apparently affecting the polar regions. Even these once pristine areas seem to have reached the 'Pyrocene'. However, it will take months before concrete results are available, during which the data will have to be examined, analysed and discussed before they can finally be published. ""The fact that we have measured both the atmosphere and the energy balance on the ground over a complete Arctic year will contribute greatly to our understanding of Arctic warming,"" adds Macke.At the moment, the joy that people and technology have survived the strains well outweighs. Also at Dr. Ronny Engelmann, scientist and laser expert from TROPOS, who is responsible for the remote sensing measurements within the OCEANET project on Polarstern: ""It was fascinating to experience the Arctic in winter and to be allowed to be in a region where only a few people have been before at this time of year. As a scientist, I am glad that, thanks to good care by my colleagues, our equipment has been able to last for a year and has also survived the extreme cold of the polar night with temperatures down to -40 degrees Celsius without any failures. The experiences of the last ten years, during which our OCEANET container has been on board of Polarstern, have been a great help. Without stable technology, we would never have known what dust layers had moved across the Arctic,"" physicist Engelmann looks back. The lidar was in operation from 28 September 2019 to 02 October 2020 without any significant failures. This was ensured by Dr Ronny Engelmann, Hannes Griesche, Martin Radenz, Julian Hofer and Dr Dietrich Althausen, some of whom spent up to four months on the five sections of the cruise. Even though the remote sensing instruments run mostly automatically, they need regular maintenance: the flash lamps that emit the laser pulses had to be changed five times, for example, or 60 litres of liquid nitrogen had to be replaced each time the microwave radiometer was calibrated. Together with other instruments such as radiation meters, cloud camera, rain gauge and photometer on the OCEANET measuring container from TROPOS, a total of over one and a half terabytes of data were collected and around 60,000 kWh of electricity was consumed.While the remote sensing instruments on the foredeck of Polarstern could practically run the entire expedition, the teams on the ice had only a short time window each, which had to be used as effectively as possible. The balloon team from TROPOS and Leipzig University was able to work on the ice for a total of 37 days. Thanks to support from other teams, 33 balloon ascents were achieved, in which the BELUGA tethered balloon, which was the size of a bus, could measure aerosol particles, radiation and meteorological parameters up to a height of 1500 metres above the ice. To fill the balloon several times, 474 cubic metres of helium were consumed and holes up to 6 metres deep had to be drilled into the thawing ice for the ice anchors. ""Our time on the ice was short but intense. The many melt ponds and frequent polar bear visits demanded a lot of improvisation. Because of the support from the whole MOSAiC team we were able to master difficult situations. This made our balloon measurements a big team effort from a great team that I will remember for a long time to come,"" said Christian Pilz of TROPOS. The vertical profiles that Pilz recorded together with the radiation measurements of his colleague Michael Lonardi from Leipzig University will provide important insights into the lower atmosphere of the summer Arctic. For example, the team was able to register temperatures of 14 degrees Celsius at an altitude of 300 metres, although the temperature on the ground was only just above freezing point. Without such on-site measurements, it would not be possible to estimate the influence of the air layers on the ground on thawing sea ice.Originally it was planned to study the near-ground atmosphere above the MOSAiC ice floe by tethered balloon and the higher layers by aeroplane in early summer. However, due to the corona pandemic, flights via Spitsbergen were not possible at that time. Supply and personnel exchange had to be organised with research vessels from Germany and the aircraft campaign had to be postponed until September. ""The measurements with the Leipzig tethered balloon are therefore important in-situ aerosol measurements at MOSAiC in this layer of air, which is very important for the climate in the Arctic,"" emphasises Andreas Macke from TROPOS, ""As an atmospheric researcher, I am particularly pleased that the balloon experiment was successful for the second time after 2017 and provided very valuable data.""In September 2020, the German research aircraft Polar 5 and Polar 6 of the AWI were the first foreign aircraft to take off from the airport Longyearbyen for several measurement flights from Spitsbergen to the central Arctic to study the atmosphere in the context of MOSAiC since the corona lockdown: ""With the extensive measurements on radiation and particles, we want to find out how clouds in the Arctic affect warming on the ground. In recent years, the Arctic has warmed up more than any other region on earth. The feedback mechanisms involved are very complex and not yet sufficiently understood. This knowledge is essential, however, if climate models are to be able to estimate how quickly the climate there will change, even for the region around the North Pole,"" explains Prof. Manfred Wendisch from the Leipzig University, who is also the spokesman for the Collaborative Research Centre ""Arctic Climate Change"" of the German Research Foundation (DFG). The network includes the universities in Bremen, Cologne and Leipzig as well as the AWI in Bremerhaven and the TROPOS in Leipzig. The aim of the research network is to observe the dramatic climate change in the Arctic using various methods in order to improve the reliability of models and enable more accurate predictions of further warming in the Arctic. The MOSAiC expedition will make a significant contribution to this and will be intensively evaluated by the alliance partners in the coming months.""I'm very pleased with how the MOSAiC expedition progressed, and what a complete success it has been. Through the expedition, we can provide the climate data and observations that humanity so urgently needs in order to make fundamental and pressing political decisions on climate protection,"" said Prof Markus Rex, Expedition Leader and head of the MOSAiC project, Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI). ""We've seen how the Arctic ice is dying. In the summer, even at the North Pole, it was characterised by extensive melting and erosion. If we don't make immediate and sweeping efforts to combat climate warming, we'll soon see ice-free Arctic summers, which will have incalculable repercussions for our own weather and climate. Though today the Central Arctic remains a fascinating, frozen landscape in winter, the ice is only half as thick as it was 40 years ago, and the winter temperatures we encountered were nearly always ten degrees warmer than what Fridtjof Nansen experienced on his ground-breaking Arctic expedition over 125 years ago.""On 20 September 2019 Polarstern departed from the Norwegian port of Tromsø, bound for the Central Arctic, the epicentre of climate change. Once there, the ship allowed itself to become trapped in the ice, and began a one-year-long drift across the North Pole, completely at the mercy of natural forces -- the route and speed were solely determined by the ice drift, powered by wind and currents. Over the five cruise legs of the expedition, a total of 442 researchers, Polarstern crewmembers, young investigators, teachers and members of the press took part. Seven ships, several aircraft and more than 80 institutions from 20 countries were involved. The researchers, who hailed from 37 countries, had a common goal: to investigate complex interactions in the climate system between the atmosphere, ice and ocean, so as to better represent them in climate models. They also explored life in the Central Arctic for an entire year. Now they have returned home with a wealth of impressions from the rapidly transforming Arctic, and with an unparalleled treasure trove of data, which an entire generation of climate researchers will focus on analysing.From Leipzig's perspective, the next major measurement campaign in the Arctic will be the ""HALO (AC)"" mission with the German research aircraft HALO and Polar 6 in spring 2022. The tethered balloon BELUGA, on the other hand, will already return to the Arctic skies in late summer 2021 -- if pandemic conditions permit.",Climate,2020.0,"The MOSAiC expedition, a year-long Arctic research mission involving 442 researchers from 37 countries, has been successful despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 and extreme weather.

But Droxler, who's studied coral reefs for more than 40 years, understands why Darwin's model persists in textbooks, university lecture halls, natural science museums and Wikipedia entries.","""It's so beautiful, so simple and pleasing that everybody still teaches it,"" said Droxler, who recently retired from Rice University. ""Every introductory book you can find in Earth science and marine science still has Darwin's model. If they teach one thing about reefs or carbonates in marine science 101, they teach that model.""Droxler, a professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice for 33 years, is hoping to set the record straight with a 37-page, tour de force paper about the origins of atolls. Published this month in the Darwin's theory about the formation of atolls was published in 1842, six years after his legendary voyage aboard the British survey ship HMS Beagle. A geologist by training, Darwin was keenly interested in the rocks and landforms he encountered in his five years aboard the Beagle. The ship's primary mission was surveying coastlines and hazards to navigation, and the ship's orders included collecting detailed observations of the tides and ocean depths around a coral atoll.""They spent a lot of time mapping reefs because they were such hazards to shipping,"" Droxler said of the Royal Navy. Atolls were particularly interesting and dangerous. Some were topped with low-lying islands but many were jagged rings of coral-topped rock that sat just below the water's surface, ready to rip the bottom out of unwary passing ships. ""They come out of the abyssal plain of the ocean to almost no depth,"" Droxler said. ""So they needed to know exactly where they were located.""The Beagle, like every Royal Navy vessel, carried charts with the marked location of every known reef, and Darwin put these to use in his 1842 paper.""He published a beautiful map that compiled all the known reefs on Earth,"" Droxler said. ""It's amazing, when you compare satellite images of reefs today versus his map. It's almost the same. It's unbelievably accurate.""But unlike navy maps that simply marked reefs as hazards to navigation, Darwin systematically classified each into one of three categories. Those attached to land, he called fringing reefs. Those detached from land and separated by a lagoon were barrier reefs. The third category was atolls, ring reefs that enclosed a central lagoon but no land.At the time, geologists believed continents were steadily rising out of the Earth and oceans were steadily sinking. Darwin noticed that both fringing and barrier reefs tended to surround volcanic islands, and he reasoned reefs initially formed on the fringe of volcanic islands. When the volcano died and slowly sank back into the ocean, the reef remained, first becoming a separated barrier reef and eventually, after the volcano sank entirely, an atoll.Droxler said he's awed by Darwin's ability to synthesize all that was known about reefs in his day and come up with such a simple, comprehensive and compelling theoretical model. But beauty aside, Darwin could not have accurately predicted how atolls form because he lacked the key piece of information, Droxler said.""Cyclic changes in sea level drive atoll formation,"" Droxler said. ""Darwin had no concept that sea level could go up and down, because glaciation didn't become common knowledge until the 1860s.""Droxler said the simplicity of Darwin's classification system and theory could play a role in its continued appeal. A more accurate description of atoll formation has been around since the 1930s, but it is considerably more complicated and much of the evidence to support it is more recent, coming in the past 40 years from dozens of scientific and oil industry drilling expeditions as well as from the compiled record of Earth's climate and sea level history.Today's atolls formed in the past 500,000 years, Droxler said, driven by five wild swings in sea level that occurred every 100,000 years. In each cycle, sea level rose and fell by 120 meters or more. But to fully appreciate how changing sea level created atolls, it helps to start much earlier, Droxler said.""The Earth's climate has changed quite dramatically in the last 5 million years,"" he said. ""From about 5 million years ago to 2.5 million years ago, we had a rather warm climate that did not change very much, and sea level remained relatively constant. At that time, the Earth was producing flat-topped banks where today we have atolls.""Sea level rose steadily but slowly, and the flat-topped banks that would give birth to atolls were created by countless generations of corals and other sea creatures that lived and died, adding their skeletons to the mineralized floor of the shallow, flat-topped marine ecosystem. The flat-top banks grew steadily, keeping pace with sea level until the warm period ended about 2.5 million years ago.""The climate began to fluctuate into cycles,"" Droxler said. ""There were alternate periods of warm and cold, but overall, the trend was that the Earth's climate got colder and colder and colder, interrupted by short warm swings.""Throughout this period, ice caps were thickening. As ice accumulated, sea level fell, exposing the tops of the flat carbonate banks, which rose out of the ocean like bleached stone mesas. When rain fell atop the exposed banks, it slowly dissolved the carbonate, and standing water sped up the process. Puddles and ponds gradually carved bowl-like depressions. And over 2 million years, this process turned white mesas into ring-like towers with hollowed-out central depressions.""Ice volume on Earth reached its initial maximum around 500,000-600,000 years ago, when a mile of ice covered Chicago, and New York was at the southern edge of a massive ice sheet on North America, comparable to modern Antarctica,"" Droxler said ""There was so much ice in North America, Scotland, Scandinavia and Siberia that sea level was reaching 120 meters to 130 meters below what it is today.""The five dramatic swings in sea level that occurred in the past half-million years were driven by Earth's ability to form large northern ice sheets, and by the sensitivity of those ice sheets to slight climatic changes, like fluctuations in the amount of sunlight landing in the far Northern Hemisphere due to slight changes in the planet's orbit and tilt.""Because these big ice sheets formed in North America, not on the pole, but centered in relatively low latitude about 65 degrees north, they accumulated huge ice volumes that lowered sea level by more than 120 meters,"" he said. ""But also, they were able to melt very quickly. And so we observe, now, these cyclic high-amplitude swings of sea level. And the first big swing was about at 450,000 years ago, when it went from minus-135 meters to plus-10 meters of what we have today.""During each swing, the hollowed out flat-topped banks were resubmerged during warm periods, when sea level rose near its highest level. During those periods, as today, coral recolonized the highest parts of the eroded banks, in particular along their raised outer rims.""Now you're adding carbonate on to their raised rim, and you're creating the modern atolls,"" Droxler said. ""But this period of high sea level doesn't last for more than 10,000-12,000 years, and it goes down again. So now you are adding some reef on the rim, but then dissolving the lagoon again when sea level retreats. So you are enhancing the morphology even more with each cycle now, growing on the margin and dissolving in the middle.""Droxler's and Jorry's in-depth study contains dozens of illustrations, including some comparisons of Darwin's original drawings with contemporary maps and satellite imagery. And the paper draws on decades of marine geological data compiled from dozens of expeditions, including recent datasets acquired by both co-authors in the Indian Ocean. Droxler said he and Jorry had discussed such a paper for years, but it might not have happened without the 2020 pandemic.Droxler moved to a remote ranch in Central Texas after retiring, and when the pandemic shut down travel in March, he was faced with the prospect of being there for some time.""For years, Stéphan had pushed me, saying we should publish this, but you know, you always kind of do something else and something else,"" Droxler said. ""At the end of March, Stéphan called me and said, 'I'm stuck in France, at home, and you're stuck in the middle of the countryside in Mason County. Let's write this paper.' And so that's what we did.""",Climate,2020.0,"Charles Darwin's theory about the formation of atolls, published in 1842, is still widely taught in Earth and marine science courses today. Darwin classified reefs into three categories: fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. He believed that atolls formed when volcanic islands sank back into the ocean, leaving behind a ring reef enclosing a central lagoon. However, Darwin did not know that cyclic changes in sea level drive atoll formation, which was discovered later.

524,13-Oct-20,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/10/201013105801.htm,Rainforest model offers glimpse into future of the Amazon,"Tropical forests may be more resilient to predicted temperature increases under global climate change than previously thought, a study published in the journal ","The group studied data from the rainforest habitat at UArizona's Biosphere 2 and compared them to measurements taken at natural tropical forest sites. Due to being encased under a glass dome, the tropical forest at Biosphere 2 is possibly the hottest tropical forest in the world, with temperatures reaching up to 40 degrees Celsius, about 6 C higher than maximum temperatures currently experienced by natural tropical forests and in the range of what scientists expect them to experience in the year 2100, absent major climate change mitigation.At Biosphere 2, when the effects of warming and drying were separated, the authors observed that, just as in natural forests, photosynthesis declined as the air dried, but when the air was wet, the trees continued to photosynthesize steadily at ever higher temperatures, right up to a forest-roasting 38 C.""No previous studies of tropical forests looked at changes in temperature much beyond to what they experience today,"" said Scott Saleska, a professor in the UArizona Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and senior author of the paper. ""Biosphere 2 gave us a unique opportunity to look at what might happen when these forests get the full global warming treatment.""The paper's lead author, Marielle Smith -- a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State University who pursued the research while she was a doctoral student in Saleska's lab at UArizona -- noted that ""previous studies suggest that tropical forests are already approaching the limit of what they can tolerate in terms of temperature, provoking concern about the impacts of future warming.""""But when we looked at the rainforest in Biosphere 2, we saw that, under some conditions, the trees there were functioning well beyond temperatures currently deemed to be the limit, and even higher than those predicted for the Amazon basin by 2100,"" she said.Smith and her co-authors wanted to know why. Biologists have long known that plants' ability to actively conduct photosynthesis, or turn carbon dioxide and water into biomolecules using sunlight, declines above a certain temperature threshold. However, the reason for this limit is not always clear.That is because as temperature increases, the relative humidity goes down, and photosynthesis can decline due to the temperature increase, the decline in water content or both. Similar to an assembly line in a factory, where productivity could be affected by a shortage of supplies entering the production process or by an excessively hot working environment directly impacting the physical performance of workers, the productivity of forests could be limited by a shortage of raw materials -- in this case, atmospheric water vapor, or humidity -- or by high temperatures wreaking havoc with the biochemical machinery itself.Understanding the reason for photosynthetic decline at higher temperatures is important because while the latter mechanism -- direct susceptibility to temperature -- would imply that tropical forests are highly vulnerable to future warming trends, the former would indicate some degree of resilience, especially under future elevated levels of carbon dioxide.The problem is that in the natural world, higher temperatures and lower water content almost always go hand-in-hand, so their effects cannot easily be separated. In Biosphere 2, however, the climate can be adjusted in ways not possible in the natural world.""The enclosed environment at Biosphere 2 allowed us to maintain high humidity despite high temperatures by adding water vapor via misters and trapping humidity inside the glass enclosure, which is something that would not happen in a natural tropical forest,"" Smith explained.This finding can be understood in terms of basic plant behavior: When there is less moisture in the air, plants react by limiting the opening of their stomata -- microscopically small openings in their leaves -- to take in carbon dioxide, one of the raw materials for synthesis. The longer the stomata remain open, the more carbon dioxide can enter the leaf, but that comes at a price: The drier the air surrounding the plant, the more water escapes through the openings, forcing the plant to strike a balance between carbon uptake and water loss.The reduction in photosynthetic productivity that previous studies had observed in the face of warmer temperatures, therefore, is likely due to plants limiting the time they keep their stomata open when confronted with drier air, in an effort to preserve water. This, in turn, limits how much carbon dioxide can enter the leaf, which may be behind the drop in photosynthetic productivity rather than the alternative scenario, in which heat damages the photosynthetic apparatus directly.To assess the sensitivity of tropical forests to future warming, the authors compared the response of photosynthesis to high temperatures in the Biosphere 2 tropical forest to that of natural tropical forest sites in Mexico and in the Brazilian Amazon. So-called eddy flux towers reaching up to nearly 200 feet high, taller than the forest canopy, allow researchers to measure the exchange of carbon dioxide between the forests and the atmosphere.""Flux towers allow us to measure the exchange of carbon dioxide between the forests and the atmosphere that we used to calculate total forest photosynthesis,"" Smith said. ""When we looked very closely at the flux tower data, we could tell that it was the same mechanism that was causing declines in real-world photosynthesis during warm periods as in Biosphere 2; it was the decline in water vapor, not the increase in temperature.""""We interpret these findings such that in the presence of high humidity, the stomata in the leaves can remain open longer without losing as much water,"" said Tyeen Taylor, a co-author of the paper and postdoctoral research associate at the University of Michigan.The authors discuss how heightened carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has the potential to have the same effect, because when more carbon dioxide is available, plants can keep their stomata opening times shorter, too, thereby limiting their water loss.The authors point out that while their findings suggest that tropical forests may be more resilient to future warming than previously thought, that does not mean that tropical forests are not vulnerable to future climate change, as photosynthesis is not the only aspect of forest health.""For example, reproduction could be affected independently, growth could be affected independently, herbivore and pathogen susceptibility could increase,"" Smith said. ""There are many other reasons not to say, 'tropical forests are out of the woods.'""The authors pointed out that Amazon forests are facing great threats from fires, deforestation and habitat destruction, and while the study may point to some resilience to coping with a warming world, ""that hardly means these forests are safe, any more than slowing down as you run a red light is safe,"" Saleska said.""We are already headed deep into the tropical forest danger zone, and if we don't mend our ways, in terms of reducing both fossil fuel emission and especially large-scale fires and increased deforestation rates, the fate of these forests will be grim indeed,"" he said. ""What this study implies, instead, is the good news that we may still have a chance, if we act now, to save these valuable tropical forests.""",Climate,2020.0,"A study conducted at the Biosphere 2 rainforest habitat in Arizona has found that tropical forests may be more resilient to global warming than previously thought.

But scientists are only beginning to understand how the effects of multiple droughts can compound to affect forests differently than a single drought alone.,"UC Santa Barbara forest ecologist Anna Trugman -- along with her colleagues at the University of Utah, Stanford University and the U.S. Forest Service -- investigated the effects of repeated, extreme droughts on various types of forests across the globe. They found that a variety of factors can increase and decrease a forest's resilience to subsequent droughts. However, the study, published in Droughts usually leave individual trees more vulnerable to subsequent droughts. ""Compounding extreme events can be really stressful on forests and trees,"" said Trugman, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography. She compares the experience to a person battling an illness: You'll be harder hit if you get sick again while you're still recovering.That said, the case is not quite so clear cut. ""Theoretically, responses to subsequent droughts could be quite varied depending on a wide range of tree-level and ecosystem-level factors,"" said lead author William Anderegg, an assistant professor at the University of Utah. So, while a drought may place a tree under considerable stress, it could also kill off some of its neighbors, leaving the survivors with less competition for water should arid conditions return.Trugman and her colleagues used a variety of data sources to investigate this effect on a broad scale. Tree ring data spanning over 100 years enabled them to see how trees that survived an initial drought grew afterward. Data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis gave them access to metrics on tree mortality for more than 100,000 forest plots from 2000 through 2018. They combined these sources with satellite measurements of the water content in forest canopies.Two clear tends emerged. ""We found that generally trees seem to become more vulnerable to stress after multiple droughts, especially conifers,"" Anderegg said.The second finding, the researchers believe, comes down to basic physiology. Conifers and their kin have different vascular systems than broadleaf trees, or ""angiosperms."" As a result, they may sustain more damage in an initial drought and be at a disadvantage compared to angiosperms during subsequent periods of drought stress. The tree ring data bears this out, showing that conifers that survived a drought grew much more slowly, especially if another drought settled in.""By contrast, angiosperms have much more flexible anatomy and physiology, and this seems to help them recover faster and more fully after initial droughts,"" Anderegg said.Anderegg was particularly surprised by the impact repeated drought had on the Amazon Rainforest. ""We tend to think of these forests as not very impacted by drought and, due to their high tree diversity, able to recover quickly,"" he said. ""But our results indicate the Amazon has been hit hard by three very severe droughts in the past 15 years.""Forests are complex systems, and a variety of factors ultimately dictate how they respond to extreme events. ""In terms of damage you need to not only think about it at the individual level, but at the forest level as well,"" said Trugman. So, although they will need time to recover from an extreme drought, surviving trees will face less competition for water resources than they had before. This could leave them in a better situation if drought returns to the area.What's more, natural selection will drive the forest as a whole to transition toward more resilient individuals, or even to more drought tolerant species overall. Repeated droughts affect forest pests and pathogens as well, and their response to these conditions will also influence how forests behave.Scientists are still working to untangle the conditions under which each of these factors rises to the top. ""This [study] provides a lot of motivation,"" said Trugman, ""but I think the next pressing step is to get at the underlying mechanisms at a physiological level and ecological level.""Researchers can use these insights to improve computer models and make more accurate forecasts about the future of forests in a changing climate. ""Climate change is going to bring more frequent droughts,"" Anderegg said, ""so we have to understand and be able to forecast how forests will respond to multiple droughts.""These results are especially crucial in the western U.S.,"" he added, ""where we've had a number of major droughts in the past 20 years.",Climate,2020.0,"A study by forest ecologists from UC Santa Barbara, the University of Utah, Stanford University, and the U.S. Forest Service has found that repeated droughts leave individual trees more vulnerable to subsequent droughts.

By comparing growth rings in Cedrela odorata trees found in the Rio Paru watershed of the eastern Amazon River with hundreds of similar chronologies in North and South America, scientists have shown an inverse relationship in tree growth, and therefore precipitation patterns, between the areas. Drought in the Amazon is correlated with wetness in the southwestern United States, Mexico and Patagonia, and vice versa.The process is driven by the El Niño phenomenon, which influences surface-level winds along the equator, researchers said. El Niño is the name given to a large-scale irregularly occurring climate pattern associated with unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean.""The new Cedrela chronologies from the Amazon, when compared with the hundreds of tree-ring chronologies in temperate North and South America, document this Pan American resonance of climate and ecosystem extremes in the centuries before widespread deforestation or human-caused climate change,"" said Dave Stahle, Distinguished Professor of geosciences and first author of a study documenting the findings in the journal The connection was not documented until researchers at the University of Arkansas Tree Ring Laboratory, along with colleagues from Brazil and Argentina, developed rainfall reconstructions from growth rings in Cedrela trees. Most rainfall records in the Amazon only date back about 70 years, but Cedrelas live for 200 to 300 years, providing valuable rainfall proxies that pre-date human-influenced climate change.In the past 40 years, drought and flood extremes have increased in the Amazon basin, the researchers noted, raising the question of whether human-induced climate change and deforestation are affecting Amazon climate. While that remains an open question, the longer Cedrela-based precipitation record indicates that periods of rainfall extremes occurred in the past and the current extremes might be partly due to natural climate rhythms.The study will help researchers better understand an area of unequaled biodiversity. The Amazon is home to an estimated 16,000 species of trees and one-tenth of all known species found on the planet, Stahle noted.

But the effects of these glacial lakes are not represented in current ice loss models, warn the study authors.","Therefore, estimates of recession rates and ice mass loss from lake-terminating glaciers in the coming decades are likely to be under-estimated.Many mountain glaciers now terminate in such lakes, formed as meltwater becomes trapped behind ridges of glacier debris. They are known as proglacial lakes. Climate change has increased glacier melt worldwide and this in turn has led to a dramatic increase in the size and number of proglacial lakes. But the effects of proglacial lakes on the rates of deglaciation and on glacier behaviour have previously been poorly understood.Now, an international team of researchers, led by the University of Leeds, has quantified for the first time the influence of proglacial lakes on mountain glaciers using computer simulations. They found that the presence of a proglacial lake causes a glacier to recede more than four times further and accelerate ice flow by up to eight times when compared to the same glacier terminating on land under the same climate.The findings, published today in the journal Study lead author Dr Jenna Sutherland undertook this research while a PhD candidate in the School of Geography at Leeds. She said: ""An ice cube in a bowl of water is going to melt much more quickly than an ice cube sitting on a table, and the effect proglacial lakes have on glacier ice is roughly the same.""The simulations show that the influence of a proglacial lake on a glacier predominantly takes place over decades to centuries rather than over millennia, meaning the glacier recedes much faster than it ever could from climatic changes alone.""Study co-author Dr Jonathan Carrivick, a senior lecturer in geomorphology at Leeds, said: ""Our findings suggest that simulations of past, contemporary or future glaciers ignore the effects of ice-contact lakes and will likely mis-represent the timing and rate of recession, especially the changes to the timing and rate that will occur once a proglacial lake forms.""This effects need to be included in all future models and simulations if we are to have an accurate global picture of glacial ice loss.""The team used the BISICLES ice-flow model, to analyse the effects of a proglacial on the Pukaki Glacier, New Zealand, during recession from the end of the last ice age.Study co-author James Shulmeister from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand said: ""While this study focussed on New Zealand, proglacial lakes are prevalent during glacial retreat worldwide and this paper should therefore be of global interest and importance.""In addition, he noted: ""This study is also critical because the timing of ice retreat is often used to determine the synchrony or lack thereof of in climate events globally.

In some cases droughts can lead to very long-term (>10 years) and irreversible soil changes, with major impacts on water quality when soils are rewet after the drought ends.""We have seen many examples of how drought in the Murray-Darling Basin has caused major issues including acidification of soil and water due to acid sulfate soils exposure in wetlands.

""The model can be run iteratively so every year a new forecast for the next three years can be created.""In addition to ocean memory, water flows are impacted by land systems -- including soils, groundwater, vegetation, and perennial snowpack -- which play important roles in tempering the effects of short-term precipitation events. The researchers hypothesized that multi-year predictions could be achieved by using long-term ocean memory and associated atmospheric effects and the filtering effects of land systems.The study's lead author, Yoshimitsu Chikamoto, assistant professor of earth systems modeling in USU's PSC department, said the components of the complex climate model include simulations of clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere, land surface characteristics, ocean currents and mixing and sea surface heat and water exchange.""These predictions can provide a more long-term perspective,"" Chikamoto said.

If imagined it seems like a cold and hostile place. However, this remote habitat is directly connected to our lives, as it forms an important part of the global carbon cycle. Also, the deep seafloor is, in many places, covered with polymetallic nodules and crusts that arouse economic interest. There is a lack of clear standards to regulate their mining and set binding thresholds for the impact on the organisms living in affected areas.","An international team of scientists around Tanja Stratmann from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany, and Utrecht University, the Netherlands, and Daniëlle de Jonge from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, has investigated the food web of the deep seafloor to see how it is affected by disturbances such as those caused by mining activities.For this, the scientists travelled to the so-called DISCOL area in the tropical East Pacific, about 3000 kilometres off the coast of Peru. Back in 1989, German researchers had simulated mining-related disturbances in this manganese nodule field, 4000 metres under the surface of the ocean, by ploughing a 3.5 km wide area of seabed with a plough-harrow. ""Even 26 years after the disturbance, the plough tracks are still there,"" Stratmann described the site. Previous studies had shown that microbial abundance and density had undergone lasting changes in this area. ""Now we wanted to find out what that meant for carbon cycling and the food web of this deep ocean habitat.""""We looked at all different ecosystem components and on all levels, trying to find out how they work together as a team,"" de Jonge explained who carried out the project as part of her Master's Thesis at the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. The scientists quantified carbon fluxes between living and non-living compartments of the ecosystem and summed them up as a measure of the ""ecological size"" of the system.They found significant long-term effects of the 1989 mining simulation experiment. The total throughput of carbon in the ecosystem was significantly reduced. ""Especially the microbial part of the food web was heavily affected, much more than we expected,"" said Stratmann. ""Microbes are known for their fast growth rates, so you'd expect them to recover quickly. However, we found that carbon cycling in the so-called microbial loop was reduced by more than one third.""The impact of the simulated mining activity on higher organisms was more variable. ""Some animals seemed to do fine, others were still recovering from the disturbance. The diversity of the system was thus reduced,"" said de Jonge. ""Overall, carbon flow in this part of the food web was similar to or even higher than in unaffected areas.""The simulated mining resulted in a shift in carbon sources for animals. Usually, small fauna feed on detritus and bacteria in the seafloor. However, in the disturbed areas, where bacterial densities were reduced, the fauna ate more detritus. The possible consequences of this will be part of de Jonge's PhD Thesis, which she just started. ""Future climate scenarios predict a decrease of the amount and quality of detritus reaching the seafloor. Thus this shift in diet will be especially interesting to investigate in view of climate change,"" she looks forward to the upcoming work.""You also have to consider that the disturbance caused by real deep-seabed mining will be much heavier than the one we're looking at here,"" she added. ""Depending on the technology, it will probably remove the uppermost 15 centimeters of the sediment over a much larger area, thus multiplying the effect and substantially increasing recovery times.""Polymetallic nodules and crusts cover many thousands of square kilometres of the world's deep-sea floor. They contain mainly manganese and iron, but also the valuable metals nickel, cobalt and copper as well as some of the high-tech metals of the rare earths. Since these resources could become scarce on land in the future -- for example, due to future needs for batteries, electromobility and digital technologies -- marine deposits are economically very interesting. To date, there is no market-ready technology for deep-sea mining. However, it is already clear that interventions in the seabed have a massive and lasting impact on the affected areas. Studies have shown that many sessile inhabitants of the surface of the seafloor depend on the nodules as a substrate, and are still absent decades after a disturbance in the ecosystem.

After studying two databases that together cover all known terrestrial mammals and birds worldwide, scientists from the CNRS, the Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB), Université Grenoble Alpes, and the University of Montpellier[1] have demonstrated that, though these species are found on all continents, they are more threatened by human pressures than ecologically common species and will also be more impacted by future climate change. Thus they are in double jeopardy. The researchers' findings, published in ","It has long been thought that rare species contribute little to the functioning of ecosystems. Yet recent studies have discredited that idea: rarity is a matter not only of the abundance or geographical range of a species, but also of the distinctiveness of its ecological functions. Because these functionally distinct species are irreplaceable, it is essential we understand their ecological characteristics, map their distributions, and evaluate how vulnerable they are to current and future threats.Using two databases that collect information on the world's terrestrial mammals (4,654 species) and birds (9,287 species), scientists from the FRB's Centre de Synthèse et d'Analyse de la Biodiversité (CESAB), CNRS research laboratories, Université Grenoble Alpes, the University of Montpellier, and partner institutes divided the earth's surface into 50 × 50 km squares and determined the number of ecologically rare species within each. They showed that ecological rarity among mammals is concentrated in the tropics and the southern hemisphere, with peaks on Indonesian islands, in Madagascar, and in Costa Rica. Species concerned are mostly nocturnal frugivores, like bats and lemurs, and insectivores, such as small rodents. Ecologically rare bird species are mainly found in tropical and subtropical mountainous regions, especially in New Guinea, Indonesia, the Andes, and Central America. The birds in question are essentially frugivorous or nectarivorous, hummingbirds being an example. For birds and terrestrial mammals alike, islands are hotspots of ecological rarity.The researchers also ranked these species according to their IUCN Red List status[2] and found they made up the bulk of the threatened species categories. That is, ecologically rare mammals account for 71% of Red List threatened species (versus 2% for ecologically common mammals); and ecologically rare birds, 44.2% (versus 0.5% for ecologically common birds). For each species, they determined (i) anthropogenic pressure exerted; (ii) human development indexes (HDIs) of host countries; and (iii) exposure to armed conflicts. The last two of these elements shape conservation policies. The scientists observed that human activity had a greater impact on ecologically rare mammals and birds than on more common species, and that these rare species were found in countries of every kind of profile, irrespective of HDI or the prevalence of warfare.[3] They used models to demonstrate that ecologically rare species will be the greatest victims of climate change, many of them facing extinction within 40 years.This profiling of ecologically rare species makes it clear that current conservation efforts, even in zones already protected, are insufficient. Conservation strategies still too often ignore functional distinctiveness and focus instead on population sizes. But it is essential to take this distinctiveness into account, letting this knowledge guide steps taken to protect these rare species. As they are necessary for healthy ecosystems, a true paradigm shift in conservation policy is needed to ensure their survival.1These scientists are affiliated with the following research units: the Centre for Marine Biodiversity, Exploitation and Conservation (CNRS / University of Montpellier / IRD / IFREMER), the Centre d'Écologie Fonctionnelle et Évolutive (CNRS / University of Montpellier / Paul Valéry University / EPHE / IRD), the Laboratoire d'Écologie Alpine (CNRS / Université Grenoble Alpes / Université Savoie Mont Blanc), and the Centre de Synthèse et d'Analyse sur la Biodiversité (CESAB) at the FRB. This research is the product of FREE, a CESAB team dedicated to the coherent integration of biodiversity data. FREE is jointly funded by the FRB and EDF.2The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is a leading international NGO focused on nature conservation. It evaluates the risk of extinction faced by different species, assigning each to a particular category (e.g., 'Least Concern', 'Near Threatened', 'Vulnerable', 'Endangered', or 'Extinct').3For example, the Philippines, where HDI is low and armed conflicts prevalent, are a hive for ecologically rare species (19 terrestrial mammals and 15 birds). Yet Australia, where HDI is high and armed conflict rare, is also home to many ecologically rare species (10 terrestrial mammals and 10 birds).",Climate,2020.0,"Recent studies have shown that rare species play a significant role in the functioning of ecosystems, and their distinct ecological functions make them irreplaceable.

Hot, arid regions such as the Middle East and the American Southwest -- considered among the highest potential producers of solar energy -- were most susceptible to greater fluctuations in sunlight, the researchers found.""Our results could help in designing better solar power plants and optimizing storage while also avoiding the expansion of solar power capacity in areas where sunlight intermittency under future climate conditions may be too high to make solar reliable,"" said corresponding author Amilcare Porporato, Princeton's Thomas J. Wu '94 Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI). The research was supported by the Carbon Mitigation Initiative based in PEI.""To use an academic metaphor, in terms of solar power, semiarid places are now like students who get an A nearly every day,"" Porporato said. ""Now, climate change is disturbing the usual dynamics of the atmosphere and the regularity of the solar radiation reaching the planet's surface. We tried to quantify how much more often those A's could become B's, or even C's, as a result.""Existing research on how solar energy will fare in this irregular future has largely focused on average levels of sunlight, said first author Jun Yin, a researcher at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology who worked on the paper at Princeton as a postdoctoral research associate with Porporato.""The novelty of our approach was to point out that in some places there is going to be more uncertainty in day-to-day variability,"" Yin said. He and Porporato previously reported that climate models underestimate the cooling effect of the daily cloud cycle. They worked on the most recent paper with co-author Annalisa Molini, an associate professor of civil infrastructure and environmental engineering at Khalifa University in the United Arab Emirates.The researchers' findings were based on probabilistic calculations similar to those used to determine the risk of flooding or drought. The reduced reliability of solar energy is related to the increased variability of atmospheric moisture and aerosols in some arid regions. Higher temperatures hold more moisture and are more turbulent, which favors the formation of clouds and keeps particles in suspension longer, Porporato said.""Then there is the issue of soils drying, which may be even more important,"" Porporato said. As temperatures and atmospheric turbulence increase in arid regions such as the Middle East, dry soils potentially lead to greater amounts of dust and atmospheric aerosols that would diminish solar radiation. These trends are in fact already detectable in observations from climate-observation networks, Porporato said.For the American Southwest, the researchers' findings were less consistent. Some models showed more solar radiation and lower intermittency in the future, while others showed less solar radiation and higher intermittency.

""It tells us that this area remained sufficiently wet and warm to support peat growth through the last ice age. The climate during that time is still poorly understood as there are few places in the very-wet tropics, where there is no dry season, that have such long sediment archives.""For the study, the research team, led by Monika Ruwaimana, a doctoral student at the UO and lecturer at Indonesia's Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, collected peat cores from two inland and three coastal sites associated with the Kapuas River in West Kalimantan, a province of Indonesia on Borneo.The Putussibau site has not been as disturbed as most other areas of Indonesia by deforestation and land conversion to agriculture.""We thought the Putussibau site would be thinner because people had already built roads over it,"" Ruwaimana said. ""But surprisingly we found depths of 17 to 18 meters. As comparison, the average peat depth in Indonesia is 5 to 6 meters.""In contrast, the coastal sites, particularly in the Kapuas River delta, contain shallower peatland that didn't begin forming until after the last ice age and after sea level stabilized between 4,000 and 7,000 years ago.The lower base of the inlet peats that were examined is lower than the current riverbed, noted co-author Gusti Z. Anshari of the Universitas Tanjungpura in Pontianak, Indonesia.""The inland peat contains an important archive about past hydrology and climates,"" he said. ""The coastal peat bed is higher than the current riverbed, making it prone to dryness. The coastal peat burns every dry season because of water loss through hydrological conductivity.""Human disturbances related to land-use changes, he added, have caused high carbon emissions and create fire-loving degraded peats.""The inland peat possibly played an important role in climate and carbon storage before and during the last ice age,"" Ruwaimana said.During that glaciation, she noted, atmospheric carbon dioxide was much lower and previous evidence suggested that much of the region's carbon had moved into the oceans. The new findings, however, show inland peatlands persisted.Across the sites, 37 radiocarbon dates were obtained. During a cool, dry period 20,000-30,000 years ago, Ruwaimana said, the new dating synthesized with previous dating across Indonesia indicated a hiatus of peatland formation.""The significance is that conditions must have remained sufficiently wet so that the peat in the upper Kapuas was not lost during this period,"" she said. ""The ages provide a clearer picture on its formation history and how it connects to the past climate. As this peat forms layer by layer like a pancake layer cake, each layer tells us the story about fire, plant and climate when that layer was formed.""With the revised depths of inland peatlands at these sites, the researchers suggest that previous estimates of carbon storage -- 25.3 gigatons across Indonesia and 9.1 gigatons on Borneo -- are too low. However, Ruwaimana said, more data is needed across the region for more accurate calculations.Depths of the older peats obtained in the study, she noted, varied dramatically, with some peats of less than two meters depth being more than 10,000 years old.The inland sites, the researchers wrote, may be the oldest tropical peats and contain the largest density of carbon in the world but are increasingly being threatened by changes in land use.Lucas Silva, a professor of geography and head of the UO's Soil Plant Atmosphere research lab, also was a co-author on the study.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have found a deep and ancient peatland in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province that provides clues about the climate of equatorial rainforests during the last ice age.

They found ice-free years have become more than three times more frequent since 1978 and 11% of lakes studied experienced at least one completely ice-free year since 1939. This trend is linked to abnormally warm winter temperatures, and the study authors project it will continue with increasing frequency due to climate change. Such ice-free years could have significant ecological, cultural and economic impacts.""Lake ice is becoming increasingly absent,"" said Alessandro Filazzola, a community ecologist at York University and the University of Alberta in Canada and lead author of the new study in AGU's journal Communities around lakes often depend on freezing events for winter recreation activities like ice fishing and ice festivals, which can bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single weekend.Lake ice also serves as an ecological ""reset,"" said Sapna Sharma, an aquatic ecologist at Canada's York University and coauthor of the new study. Lakes are warmer in years without ice cover, and they stratify earlier, which could make them more prone to toxic algal blooms. This, in turn, can harm fish or make lakes dangerous for swimming. ""The consequences are more widespread than simply one individual unable to go ice fishing,"" Sharma said.Interestingly, the authors saw the same warming trend regardless of location, suggesting global climate change is already having an impact on Earth's lakes. ""This isn't just happening in one lake in the northern United States,"" Filazzola said. ""It's happening in thousands of lakes around the world.""In the new study, Filazzola and his colleagues wanted to understand how the frequency of lakes' ice-free years has changed over time. They selected 122 lakes in North America, Europe and Asia with a long, consistent record of data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The NSIDC lake ice database contains historically available data from harbors, newspapers and other written records and modern data sourced from people who live near the lakes.Lake Suwa in Japan boasts one of the oldest lake ice records in the database, stretching back to 1443. The record has been maintained by 15 generations of Shinto priests that have celebrated the appearance of lake ice each winter. Other culturally important lakes in the dataset include Lakes Baikal, Geneva, Balaton, Champlain and Michigan.Filazzola, Sharma and their colleagues analyzed ice-free years in their chosen lakes, comparing how often this extreme event occurred in the first 40 versus the last 40 years of the study period. If a lake did not have 100% ice cover for at least one day, it was considered an ice-free year. They then compared the lake ice data with local air temperatures and climate cycles like El Niño and the North Atlantic Decadal Oscillation to better understand the drivers behind lake ice changes.They found ice-free years occurred much more commonly in the second half of their study period, with 31 recorded ice-free events before 1978 and 108 ice-free events after that year. Since 1990, Lake Champlain and Grand Traverse Bay in Lake Michigan have both experienced three consecutive years without freezing. Lake Suwa, which once froze regularly, now freezes an average of two years every decade, according to the study.""Even in the last 40 years versus the last 80 years, there's already an obvious pattern that's occurring and it's showing that we're already experiencing a response from warming, which will likely get worse,"" Filazzola said.The results showed local winter air temperatures were the best predictor of ice-free years, which became significantly more likely once average winter temperatures rose to -4 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit). The researchers found lakes in more southern and coastal regions were most vulnerable to experiencing ice-free years since they have high rates of warming.""I think it is intuitive,"" Sharma said of their results. ""But it also gives us a historical snapshot to understand that the climate is changing. It's not normal that these lakes are not freezing.""""I am delighted by this paper,"" said John Magnuson, a limnologist at the University of Wisconsin Madison who has worked on past lake ice studies but was not involved in this research, calling it ""a significant paper that provides new information and insights about a climate-sensitive component of lake ecosystems to climate change.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has found that ice-free years have become more than three times more frequent since 1978, with 11% of lakes studied experiencing at least one completely ice-free year since 1939.

Wout Boerjan (VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology) have discovered a way to stably finetune the amount of lignin in poplar by applying CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Lignin is one of the main structural substances in plants and it makes processing wood into, for example, paper difficult. This study is an important breakthrough in the development of wood resources for the production of paper with a lower carbon footprint, biofuels, and other bio-based materials. Their work, in collaboration with VIVES University College (Roeselare, Belgium) and University of Wisconsin (USA) appears in ","Today's fossil-based economy results in a net increase of COProf. Wout Boerjan (VIB-UGent): ""A few years ago, we performed a field trial with poplars that were engineered to make wood containing less lignin. Most plants showed large improvements in processing efficiency for many possible applications. The downside, however, was that the reduction in lignin accomplished with the technology we used then -- RNA interference -- was unstable and the trees grew less tall.""Undeterred, the researchers went looking for a solution. They employed the recent CRISPR/Cas9 technology in poplar to lower the lignin amount in a stable way, without causing a biomass yield penalty. In other words, the trees grew just as well and as tall as those without genetic changes.Dr. Barbara De Meester (VIB-UGent): ""Poplar is a diploid species, meaning every gene is present in two copies. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we introduced specific changes in both copies of a gene that is crucial for the biosynthesis of lignin. We inactivated one copy of the gene, and only partially inactivated the other. The resulting poplar line had a stable 10% reduction in lignin amount while it grew normally in the greenhouse. Wood from the engineered trees had an up to 41% increase in processing efficiency.""Dr. Ruben Vanholme (VIB-UGent): ""The mutations that we have introduced through CRISPR/Cas9 are similar to those that spontaneously arise in nature. The advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 method is that the beneficial mutations can be directly introduced into the DNA of highly productive tree varieties in only a fraction of the time it would take by a classical breeding strategy.""The applications of this method are not only restricted to lignin but might also be useful to engineer other traits in crops, providing a versatile new breeding tool to improve agricultural productivity.",Climate,2020.0,"Scientists at VIB-UGent have used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create poplar trees with a stable 10% reduction in lignin, a key component of wood that makes it difficult to process.

Climate and carbon cycle in perpetual interaction,"The current climate crisis underlines that carbon cycle perturbations can cause significant climate change. New research reveals how carbon cycle and global climate have been interacting throughout the last 35 million years of geologic history, under natural circumstances.","Human-made global heating has long been presented as a relatively simple chain of cause and effect: humans disrupt the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, thereby increase the concentration of COTo reveal these kind of climate-carbon cycle feedback mechanisms under natural circumstances, David De Vleeschouwer and colleagues exploited isotopic data from deep-ocean sediment cores. ""Some of these cores contain sediments of up to 35 million years old. Despite their respectable age, these sediments carry a clear imprint of so-called Milankovi? cycles. Milankovi? cycles relate to rhythmic changes in the shape of the Earth's orbit (eccentricity), as well as to the tilt (obliquity) and orientation (precession) of the Earth's rotational axis. Like an astronomical clockwork, Milankovi? cycles generate changes in the distribution of solar insolation over the planet, and thus provoke cadenced climate change,"" explains David De Vleeschouwer. ""We looked at the carbon and oxygen isotope composition of microfossils within the sediment and first used the eccentricity, obliquity and precession cadences as geological chronometers. Then, we applied a statistical method to determine whether changes in one isotope system lead or lag variability in the other isotope.""His colleague Maximilian Vahlenkamp adds: ""When a common pattern in both isotope systems occurs just a little earlier in the carbon system compared to the oxygen isotope system, we call this a carbon-isotope lead. We then infer that the carbon cycle exerted control over the climate system at the time of sediment deposition."" Paleoclimatologists and paleoceanographers often use carbon isotopes as an indicator of carbon-cycle perturbations, and oxygen isotopes as a proxy for changes in global climate state. Changes in the isotopic composition of these deep-sea microfossils may indicate, for example, an increase in the continental carbon storage by land plants and soils, or global cooling with a growth of ice caps.""The systematic and time-continuous analysis of leads and lags between carbon cycle and climate constitutes the innovative character of this study. Our approach allows to sequence Earth's history at high resolution over the past 35 million years,"" says Prof Heiko Pälike. ""We show that the past 35 million years can be subdivided in three intervals, each with its specific climate-carbon cycle modus operandi."" On average, the authors found oxygen isotopes to lead carbon isotope variations. This means that, under natural conditions, climate variations are largely regulating global carbon cycle dynamics. However, the research team focused on times when the opposite was the case. Indeed, De Vleeschouwer and colleagues found a few examples of ancient periods during which the carbon cycle drove climate change on approximately 100,000-year timescales, just as it is the case now on much shorter timescales -- ""but then of course without human intervention,"" states Pälike.During the oldest interval, between 35 and 26 million years ago, the carbon cycle took the lead over climate change mostly during periods of climate stability. ""Periods of climate stability in the geologic record often have an astronomical cause. When the Earth's orbit around the sun is close to a perfect circle, seasonal insolation extremes are truncated and more equable climates are enforced,"" explains David De Vleeschouwer. ""Between 35 and 26 million years ago, such astronomical configuration would have been favourable for a temporal expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet. We propose that under such a scenario, the intensity of glacial erosion and subsequent rock weathering increased. This is important, because the weathering of silicate rocks removes COBut around 26 million years ago, the modus operandi radically changed. The carbon cycle took control over climate at times of climate volatility, not stability. ""We believe this change traces back to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains and a monsoon-dominated climate state. When seasonal insolation extremes are amplified through an eccentric Earth orbit, monsoons can become truly intense. Stronger monsoons permit more chemical weathering, the removal of COThe mechanisms proposed by the authors not only explain the observed patterns in carbon and oxygen isotopes, they also provide new ideas as to how the climate system and the carbon cycle interacted through time. ""Some hypotheses need further testing with numerical climate and carbon cycle models, but the process-level understanding presented in this work is important because it provides a glimpse at the machinery of our planet under boundary conditions that are fundamentally different from today's,"" says De Vleeschouwer. Moreover, this work also provides scenarios that can be used to evaluate the ability of climate-carbon cycle models when they are pushed to the extreme scenarios of the geologic past.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have found that the carbon cycle has driven climate change on timescales of approximately 100,000 years during ancient periods, just as it is doing now, but without human intervention.

Countries planning large-scale investments in new nuclear power are risking suppression of greater climate benefits from alternative renewable energy investments.""The researchers, using World Bank and International Energy Agency data covering 1990-2014, found that nuclear and renewables tend to exhibit lock-ins and path dependencies that crowd each other out, identifying a number of ways in which a combined nuclear and renewable energy mix is incompatible.These include the configuration of electricity transmission and distribution systems where a grid structure optimized for larger scale centralized power production such as conventional nuclear, will make it more challenging, time-consuming and costly to introduce small-scale distributed renewable power.Similarly, finance markets, regulatory institutions and employment practices structured around large-scale, base-load, long-lead time construction projects for centralized thermal generating plant are not well designed to also facilitate a multiplicity of much smaller short-term distributed initiatives.Andy Stirling, Professor of Science and Technology Policy at the University of Sussex Business School, said: ""This paper exposes the irrationality of arguing for nuclear investment based on a 'do everything' argument.

This means they store roughly twice as much carbon as all the world's forests combined. However, peat harvesting and climate change are threatening these long-term carbon stores because there is not enough founder material for cultivating peat mosses on a large scale. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Greifswald, a team of scientists led by plant biotechnologist Professor Ralf Reski from the Faculty of Biology of the University of Freiburg in Germany has established the world's largest laboratory collection of mosses of the genus Sphagnum. With this as a foundation, peat mosses can be grown in a sustainable and economic way. The scientists have published their research in the scientific journal ","For their project -- called MOOSzucht -- the scientists collected sporophytes, the spore capsules of mosses, of 19 Sphagnum species in Austria, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The world's largest collection of Sphagnum cultures is now housed in the International Moss Stock Center (IMSC), a resource center founded in 2010 at the University of Freiburg. Scientists use the spores to create pure peat moss cultures in a laboratory environment that are not contaminated by bacteria, fungi, algae, or suchlike. Some species grow at a rate 50 to 100 times faster in the laboratory than in a moor landscape. The researchers measured the growth of the mosses in liquid mediums containing nutrients, also known as suspension cultures. They also determined how many sets of chromosomes could be found in the cell nuclei in the cultures and compared this to the genome size of the already established model moss Physcomitrella patens. In this way they were able to identify haploid and diploid Sphagnum species -- in other words, species with single or double sets of chromosomes, respectively. However, they could not find a correlation between the number of sets of chromosomes and moss growth, meaning it is still unclear why diploid mosses exist in nature.Peat is harvested on a large scale for growing vegetables and ornamental plants in greenhouses and home gardens.

The research, based on computer models and data analysis, is published in the journal ","Rainforests are very sensitive to changes that affect rainfall for extended periods. If rainfall drops below a certain threshold, areas may shift into a savanna state.""In around 40 percent of the Amazon, the rainfall is now at a level where the forest could exist in either state -- rainforest or savanna, according to our findings,"" says lead author Arie Staal, formerly a postdoctoral researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Copernicus Institute of Utrecht University.The conclusions are concerning because parts of the Amazon region are currently receiving less rain than previously and this trend is expected to worsen as the region warms due to rising greenhouse gas emissions.Staal and colleagues focused on the stability of tropical rainforests in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. With their approach they were able to explore how rainforests respond to changing rainfall.""By using the latest available atmospheric data and teleconnection models, we were able to simulate the downwind effects of disappearance of forests for all tropical forests. By integrating these analyses over the entire tropics, the picture of the systematic stability of tropical forests emerged,"" says Obbe Tuinenburg, former assistant professor at the Copernicus Institute of Utrecht University and visiting scientist at the Stockholm Resilience Centre.The team explored the resilience of tropical rainforests by looking at two questions: what if all the forests in the tropics disappeared, where would they grow back? And its inverse: what happens if rainforests covered the entire tropical region of Earth?Such extreme scenarios could inform scientists about the resilience and stability of real tropical forests. They can also help us understand how forests will respond to the changing rainfall patterns as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rise.The researchers ran the simulations starting with no forests in the tropics across Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia. They watched forests emerge over time in the models. This allowed them to explore the minimum forest cover for all regions.Staal said, ""The dynamics of tropical forests is interesting. As forests grow and spread across a region this affects rainfall -- forests create their own rain because leaves give off water vapour and this falls as rain further downwind. Rainfall means fewer fires leading to even more forests. Our simulations capture this dynamic.""The team ran the models a second time, this time in a world where rainforests entirely covered the tropical regions of Earth. This is an unstable scenario because in many places there is not enough rainfall to sustain a rainforest. In many places the forests shrank back due to lack of moisture.Staal says, ""As forests shrink, we get less rainfall downwind and this causes drying leading to more fire and forest loss: a vicious cycle.""Finally the researchers explored what happens if emissions keep rising this century along a very high-emissions scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).Overall, the researchers found that as emissions grow, more parts of the Amazon lose their natural resilience, become unstable and more likely to dry out and switch to become a savanna-type ecosystem. They note that even the most resilient part of the rainforest shrinks in area. In other words, more of the rainforest is prone to crossing a tipping point as emissions of greenhouse gases reach very high levels.""If we removed all the trees in the Amazon in a high-emissions scenario a much smaller area would grow back than would be the case in the current climate,"" says co-author Lan Wang-Erlandsson of the Stockholm Resilience Centre.The researchers conclude that the smallest area that can sustain a rainforest in the Amazon contracts a substantial 66% in the high-emissions scenario.In the Congo basin the team found that the forest remains at risk of changing state everywhere and will not grow back once gone, but that under a high emissions scenario part of the forest becomes less prone to crossing a tipping point.

""Blanket forecasts on climate change are not specific enough to assist in counteracting the threat of further loss of biodiversity. This can only succeed if we know exactly what local climate change -- for example in nature reserves -- will be caused by global trends. As our study impressively demonstrates, these local effects can be very different, even in neighbouring areas,"" says Beierkuhnlein.Particularly severe local climate changes are expected by 2070, especially in protected areas of tropical countries. Today, these are of great importance for the conservation of globally endangered plant and animal species, and are under great pressure because, at the same time, they are being used intensively by humans. These protected areas are located in mountains high above sea level. In mountains, temperatures are expected to rise noticeably as a result of climate change. Consequently, some endangered species will probably try to migrate to higher and therefore cooler mountain regions. Here, the threat to individual species could increase rapidly because fewer resources are available at higher altitudes. ""For migratory species, higher mountain regions could prove to be a dead end,"" Hoffmann explains.However, the new study also shows that protected areas in which future climate conditions will differ especially from the present have some characteristics that could have a beneficial effect on the conservation of species. They are often very large, have very different landscape profiles, and therefore offer diverse environmental conditions which are little affected by direct human intervention or fragmented by traffic routes. These circumstances favour the adaptation of species, for example through genetic exchange and greater availability of resources. In addition, some species that are forced to leave their current habitats due to climate change may find new habitats in their very neighbourhood thanks to this diversity of landscape. Hence, management that is well informed about local climate changes can help to mitigate the effects of climate change in nature reserves.Forecasts of global climate change are always fraught with uncertainty. This is why the Bayreuth researchers worked with ten different global models of climate change in their study of nature reserves. In addition, they included two significantly different scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions in their assessments. In each of the nature reserves studied, small square areas measuring around one square kilometre were examined. Characteristic properties of these ""cells"" were then put into relation with climatic change to be expected on a global scale by 2070. These characteristics include, for example, height above sea level, landscape profile, precipitation and temperature, local flora and fauna, and human intervention. With these investigations, the Bayreuth researchers have succeeded in estimating local climate change effects for very small areas worldwide.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study by the Biogeography research group has examined 137,735 nature reserves on six continents to determine what deviations from current climate conditions these areas will be exposed to over the next five decades and how this will impact local plant and animal species. The study found that blanket forecasts on climate change are not specific enough to assist in counteracting the threat of further loss of biodiversity. Particularly severe local climate changes are expected by 2070, especially in protected areas of tropical countries, which are of great importance for the conservation of globally endangered plant and animal species. However, the study also shows that protected areas in which future climate",,

""Since river deltas have long been recognized as hotspots of population growth, and with increasing impacts from climate change, we realized we needed to properly quantify what the cumulative risks are in river deltas.""The findings are the result of a collaboration facilitated by IU's Institute for Advanced Study with support from the Environmental Resilience Institute.The team's analysis shows that river deltas occupy 0.5 percent of the earth's land surface, yet they contain 4.5 percent of the global population -- a total of 339 million people. Because river deltas form at the ocean at or below sea level, they are highly prone to storm surges, which are expected to occur more frequently due to climate change-fueled sea-level rise and coastal flooding.In the study, IU researchers analyzed these geographic regions, which include cities like New Orleans, Bangkok, and Shanghai, using a new global dataset to determine how many people live on river deltas, how many are vulnerable to a 100-year storm surge event, and the ability of the deltas to naturally mitigate impacts of climate change.""River deltas present special challenges for predicting coastal floods that deserve more attention in discussions about the future impacts of climate change,"" said IU Distinguished Professor of Anthropology Eduardo Brondizio, a co-author of the study who has been working with rural and urban communities in the Amazon delta for 3 decades. ""Our estimates are likely a minimum because the storm surge and flooding models do not account for the compound interactions of the climate impacts, deficient infrastructure, and high population density.""With Edmonds and Brondizio, co-authors on the study include Rebecca Caldwell and graduate student Sacha Siani.In addition to the threat of flooding, many of the residents in river deltas are low-income and experience water, soil, and air pollution, poor and subnormal housing infrastructure, and limited access to public services. According to the study, of the 339 million people living on deltas throughout the world, 31 million of these people are living in the 100-year storm surge floodplains. To make matters worse, 92 percent of the 31 million live in developing or least-developed economies. As a result, some of the most disadvantaged populations are among the most at-risk to the impacts of climate change.""These communities are already dealing with health risks, lack of sanitation and services, poverty, and exposure to flooding and other environmental risks. Climate change is exacerbating all of these issues and creating more impacts,"" Brondizio said.To conduct their study, the researchers created a global dataset of delta populations and areas, aggregating 2,174 delta locations. They then cross-referenced the dataset with a land population count to determine how many people were living in the deltas. To determine the natural mitigation capacity of the deltas, researchers looked at the volume of incoming sediment deposited by rivers and other waterways flowing out to sea. The volume of incoming sediment was compared to the relative area of the delta to determine if the delta would be considered sediment starved and thus unable to naturally mitigate flooding.Decades of engineering have expanded the habitable land area of river deltas, but they've also starved the regions of flood-preventing sediment. Without the sediment being renewed naturally, the shorelines will continue to recede, worsening the impacts of storm surges""To effectively prepare for more intense future coastal flooding, we need to reframe it as a problem that disproportionately impacts people on river deltas in developing and least-developed economies,"" said Edmonds. ""We need better models for the climate impacts that are capable of stimulating compound flooding in densely populated areas so that exposure and risk can be mapped to more accurately assess risk and vulnerability.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study from Indiana University (IU) has found that river deltas, which account for just 0.5% of the Earth’s land surface, are home to 4.5% of the global population, some 339 million people.

Radiocarbon dating and analyses of the marine sediment record revealed that recurrent episodes of discharge from this ice sheet over the past 42,000 years were early events in a chain reaction of disturbances to the global climate. These disturbances triggered changes in deep ocean circulation and retreat of ice sheets in the North Atlantic.The findings challenge theories that those massive, globally-reaching disturbances originated in the North Atlantic as rapid ice loss from the Laurentide ice sheet, another massive ice sheet that covered much of Canada and the northern United States, including the upper Midwest and Northeast. The Laurentide ice loss events are known as Heinrich Events.""The outcome of this research was unexpected. The data irrevocably says that the Pacific ice goes first, with Heinrich Events and other changes following in a rhythm. The Pacific Ocean sets the drum beat,"" Walczak said. ""This is a paradigm shift in our thinking about how these events are connected.""To gain insight into the climate history of the North Pacific, an international team of researchers collected and analyzed sediment cores from the northern Gulf of Alaska that were recovered by drilling as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program.""Getting these new insights took years of work. We first mapped the seafloor and recovered short sediment cores in 2004, drilled longer cores in 2013 and had 16 years of painstaking laboratory work involving several Ph.D. students,"" said Alan Mix, the project's principal investigator and co-author of the paper.""This was a virtually unknown area when we started, and now it offers among the most detailed and best-dated long records of ocean change on the planet during the ice age,"" said Mix, a distinguished professor in OSU's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.Researchers measured radioactive isotopes of carbon using two particle accelerators to establish the chronology of events and also added meticulous counts of small rocks dropped by icebergs known as ice-rafted debris.The research team traced the source of the ice-rafted debris back to purges of massive ice streams emanating from the Cordilleran ice sheet, which covered northern Washington, most of British Columbia and southern Alaska from about 70,000 to 17,000 years ago.Dirty icebergs broke off from surging ice streams and drifted northward in ocean currents, carrying and eventually dropping their load of sand, pebbles and gravel, leaving a record of rapid ice retreat buried in the deep sea like sunken treasure.The authors of the study named these Alaskan iceberg dumps ""Siku Events"" after the Inuit word for ice. The big surprise, discovered by combining the record of glacial debris with the radiocarbon chronology, was that Siku Events immediately preceded Heinrich events, which are a similar type of ice purge in the North Atlantic.Scientists have been aware of Heinrich Events, from similar evidence of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic, for more than 30 years but the trigger for those events has never been convincingly explained, the researchers said.It makes sense for the Pacific Ocean to be involved in major planetary changes, Mix said. The Pacific Ocean is connected to the rest of the world by large-scale atmospheric circulation and physically around Antarctica, and during times of high sea level, through the Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic.""The Pacific Ocean is the largest exchangeable reservoir of heat and water and carbon dioxide on Earth, simply because of its massive size,"" he said. ""It really is the 800-pound gorilla in the zoo of climate beasts.""Today the ice that remains along the coast of Alaska is mostly retreating and may be gone within this century as the climate warms. The melting ice will drain to the Pacific and the Arctic, contributing to sea level rise and impacting the balance of buoyant fresh and dense salty water in the ocean, much as it did in the past.If the current ice melt follows patterns of the past, and happens quickly, it could contribute to the retreat of distant glacial systems in the North Atlantic and the Arctic.""This is yet another reason that it is prudent to slow down warming by reducing our fossil-fuel use,"" Mix said.""The new findings are likely to fuel increased interest in the North Pacific, an area that has not been as well-studied as other parts of the planet,"" Walczak said.One thing that remains unclear is why the discharges from the Cordilleran ice sheet occurred. Researchers also would like to better understand the relationship between the discharges of the Cordilleran and the other climate events.""Why did the other ice sheets respond to the retreat of the Cordilleran? How fast do the dominoes fall in this sequence of events?"" Walczak asked. Those are among the questions the research team is continuing to investigate.The research was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Australian Research Council, the Australian-New Zealand IODP Commission and the American Australian Association.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers from Oregon State University have found that the Pacific Ocean may be the trigger for global climate changes.

Now pursuing a PhD at the University of Exeter, she said: ""When we first began looking at this flatworm, we were interested in how it tolerated salinity levels in it natural habitat. However, we quickly found out about Dorothy's study in 1914 so it became a perfect test of how an individual population had adapted to changes within its immediate environment. The findings provide really interesting evidence of the impacts of climate change, but it has also been inspiring for me to revisit Dorothy's work and highlight a pioneering female scientist of her time.""The research's co-author, Professor of Marine Zoology John Spicer, supervised Katharine's work and is an authority on how marine species can adapt to climate change. He added: ""There has been an idea around for the last 15 to 20 years called evolutionary rescue where, faced with rapid climate change, animals evolve to survive. Many, including myself, have doubted the possibility of such rescue, especially over such a short space of time in terms of species evolution. But this study shows it may well be possible in the wild because, in comparing two identical experiments 100 years apart, the animal has changed how it works, its physiology.""It is proof that evolutionary rescue may exist in the wild, not just in the laboratory, and is a major step forward in our understanding of how species can adapt as the environment around them changes.

Final energy is that delivered to the consumer's door, for example, heating, electricity or the petrol that goes into a car, rather than the energy embedded in fuels themselves -- much of which is lost at power stations in the case of fossil fuels.The team built a final energy-model, which builds upon a list of basic material needs that underpin human well-being previously developed by Narasimha Rao and Jihoon Min.The study compared current final energy consumption across 119 countries to the estimates of final energy needed for decent living and found the vast majority of countries are living in significant surplus. In countries that are today's highest per-capita consumers, energy cuts of nearly 95% are possible while still providing decent living standards to all.Study lead author Dr Joel Millward-Hopkins from the School of Earth and Environment at Leeds said: ""Currently, only 17% of global final energy consumption is from non-fossil fuel sources. But that is nearly 50% of what we estimate is needed to provide a decent standard of living for all in 2050.""""Overall, our study is consistent with the long-standing arguments that the technological solutions already exist to support reducing energy consumption to a sustainable level.

""By reflecting the sun's rays back into space or trapping heat close to the Earth's surface like a blanket, clouds help either cool off or warm up the planet.""","Schmale -- along with scientists from the Paul Scherrer Institute's Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry and Stockholm University's Department of Environmental Science and Bolin Centre for Climate Research -- spent several weeks collecting data near the North pole in August and September 2018, as part of the US-Swedish expedition Arctic Ocean 2018 on board the Swedish icebreaker Oden. The scientists measured the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric molecules and aerosol particles to better understand the conditions leading to cloud formation.""One of our objectives was to investigate how new aerosol particles could form in the Arctic atmosphere,"" says Andrea Baccarini, a PhD student at the Paul Scherrer Institute and now scientific collaborator in the extreme Environments research Laboratory. ""Under the right conditions, gas molecules condense together into small clusters that can grow, eventually forming aerosols."" If these aerosols grow even just a small amount larger, they can function as cloud condensation nuclei, which are essential for cloud formation.In the Arctic summer and fall, the concentration of aerosols is extremely low. ""The contribution of newly formed aerosols can be extremely important and even a small change in aerosol concentration in the high Arctic could have a major impact on cloud formation or alter clouds' radiative properties,"" says Baccarini. It is also still not clear how important local aerosol processes are to cloud formation in comparison to regional or long-range transport, for example. ""With this expedition, we could investigate the exact sources of aerosol particles that are needed to form clouds"" adds Paul Zieger, an assistant professor at Stockholm University who led the research project on aerosol-cloud processes of the 2018 expedition.The research team found that iodic acid, a chemical compound which had not previously been observed in the region, triggers the formation of new aerosols between late summer and early fall.

More than 35,000 such species had been recorded by 2005 (the date of the most recent comprehensive global catalogue). Some of these aliens can go on to become invasive, with damaging impacts to ecosystems and economies. Alien species are one of the main drivers of extinctions of animals and plants.Co-author Professor Tim Blackburn (UCL Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research and the Institute of Zoology, ZSL) said: ""Our study predicts that alien species will continue to be added to ecosystems at high rates through the next few decades, which is concerning as this could contribute to harmful biodiversity change and extinction.""But we are not helpless bystanders: with a concerted global effort to combat this, it should be possible to slow down or reverse this trend.""For the study, the research team developed a mathematical model to calculate for the first time how many more aliens would be expected by 2050, based on estimated sizes of source pools (the species that could end up becoming invasive) and dynamics of historical invasions, under a 'business-as-usual' scenario that assumes a continuation of current trends.The model predicts a 36% increase in the number of alien plant and animal species worldwide by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.The study identifies high levels of variation between regions. The largest increase is expected in Europe, where the number of alien species will increase by 64% by the middle of the century. Additional alien hotspots are predicted to include temperate latitudes of Asia, North America, and South America. The lowest relative increase in alien species is expected in Australia.Europe will also see the largest increase in absolute numbers of alien species, with around 2,500 new aliens predicted.Lead author Dr Hanno Seebens (Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Germany) said: ""These will primarily include rather inconspicuous new arrivals such as insects, molluscs, and crustaceans. In contrast, there will be very few new alien mammal species such as the well-known raccoon.""Co-author Dr Franz Essl (University of Vienna) added: ""Increases are expected to be particularly large for insects and other arthropods, such as arachnids and crustaceans. We predict the number of aliens from these groups to increase in every region of the world by the middle of the century -- by almost 120% in the temperate latitudes of Asia.""The study also predicts that the rate of arrival of alien species will continue to increase, at least in some animal groups. Globally, by 2050, alien arthropod and bird species in particular will arrive faster than before, compared to the period 1960 -- 2005. In Europe, the rate of new alien arrivals is expected to increase for all plant and animal groups except mammals.Neither a reversal nor even a slowdown in the spread of alien species is in sight, as global trade and transport are expected to increase in the coming decades, allowing many species to infiltrate new habitats as stowaways.Dr Seebens said: ""We will not be able to entirely prevent the introduction of alien species, as this would mean severe restrictions in international trade.""However, stricter regulations and their rigorous enforcement could greatly slow the flow of new species.

Subsidence can occur when large amounts of groundwater are removed from underground stores, called aquifers.The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, took advantage of the incredibly fine-scale resolution of InSAR to evaluate subsidence patterns according to crop type, revealing surprising results. For example, despite reports of high water consumption by fruit and nut crops in California, the crop types with the greatest rates of subsidence, and by association the greatest rates of groundwater use, were field crops such as corn and soy, followed by pasture crops like alfalfa, truck crops like tomatoes, and lastly, fruit and nut crops like almonds and grapes.""Our initial hypothesis was that fruit and nut crops would be associated with some of the highest rates of subsidence, but we found the opposite,"" said study lead author, Morgan Levy, an assistant professor with a joint appointment with UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography and School of Global Policy and Strategy.Because displacement is a response to groundwater storage change in locations with varying geology, soils and vegetation, the interpretation of InSAR varies across locations, unlike satellite measurements of climate that have the same interpretation in any location. Therefore, InSAR must be combined with other sources of geophysical data to achieve location-specific insight into groundwater use.By combining InSAR with other land surface datasets including land cover, potential evapotranspiration (a measure of plant water demand), and the location of surface water supply networks, UC San Diego researchers found that between 2015 and 2017, subsidence occurred at much higher rates in irrigated cultivated land compared to undeveloped land, and in dry surface water-limited years relative to wet years.Over the study period, there was a median 272 millimeters (or 16 inches) of total cumulative subsidence for field crops (like corn and soy), and a dry water year subsidence rate of 131 millimeters (5 inches) per year. For fruit and nut crops, (like almonds and grapes) there was a median 62 millimeters (2.5 inches) of total subsidence over the study period, and a dry water year subsidence rate of 31 millimeters (1 inch) per year.""The outcome might be explained by two things. First, on average fruits and nuts require less water physiologically, compared to field and pasture crops. Second, field and pasture crops tend to use irrigation methods that are less efficient and higher-volume than those used by fruit and nut crops,"" Levy said. ""However, fruits and nuts may still consume greater total volumes of water because they occupy more land area, even if their groundwater use intensity is less.""Methods and findings from this research could be used to support the state's ongoing effort to prevent overdraft of groundwater aquifers. Groundwater is a critical resource both nationally and globally: In the U.S., groundwater is a source of drinking water for roughly half of the population, and constitutes the largest source of irrigation water for agriculture. Irrigation accounts for approximately 70 percent of total U.S. groundwater withdrawals, and California has the highest rates of groundwater pumping in the nation.""Our findings indicate that in the Central Valley, the costs and benefits of transitions away from field crops and towards fruit and nut crops in recent years are more complex than typically assumed,"" Levy added. ""Our results suggest the possibility that transitions to fruit and nut cultivation might be desirable, at least from a groundwater sustainability perspective, although more research is needed to confirm this.""California is an example of a semi-arid and irrigation-dependent climate for agriculture. Coordinated efforts from the UC San Diego team of climate scientists and geophysicists to link subsidence, groundwater and surface water use, and crop production data across comparable time and space scales has tremendous potential to advance groundwater monitoring and management in agricultural regions in other parts of the world, said the authors.In the San Joaquin Valley during wet years, farmers may receive up to 100 percent of their surface water allocations, while in extremely dry years, they may receive none. When surface water supplies are unavailable, farmers mine groundwater. Thus, groundwater has become increasingly important under climate change, as California and many parts of the world have experienced surface water shortages. However, excessive pumping does occur, even in relatively wet years. And, aquifers can run out.In 2014, California passed legislation mandating a gradual, locally led shift towards sustainable use of groundwater -- the resource on which 85 percent of its population and much of its $50-billon agriculture industry rely. The data from InSAR can be critical to the state's efforts to perform effective monitoring and management in response to climate change.While the legislation has encouraged local agencies to begin to use InSAR for documenting land subsidence, uses of InSAR for direct monitoring of groundwater use are early in their development. The UC San Diego research efforts provide an example of how water managers might use satellite data sources, including InSAR, to directly monitor local relationships between subsidence, groundwater pumping and crop portfolios.""The promise of InSAR lies in our ability to combine it with other sources of geophysical and social data to answer water policy-relevant questions,"" Levy and co-authors wrote. ""We provide a preview of the power of such a synthesis, demonstrating that spatial patterns of subsidence and their relationship to agricultural cultivation and associated water demand are clear and robust.""They concluded, ""Our findings suggest that policy levers supporting sustainable groundwater management might benefit from consideration of the groundwater use intensity of crop selection, not only the difficult-to-define sustainability of groundwater extraction volumes over groundwater aquifer boundaries that remain uncertain and that are costly to delineate.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at the University of California, San Diego have used satellite-based InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technology to create high-resolution maps of land surface motion in space and time to evaluate subsidence patterns according to crop type.

As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ""No man ever steps in the same river twice."" Although this dynamic nature is often out of sight and mind, forgetting about it has led to many a historical catastrophe.","Recently, UC Santa Barbara geomorphologist Vamsi Ganti and his collaborators published a study finding that sea level rise will cause rivers to jump course, or avulse, more often on deltas than in the past. Now his team has discovered that a perfect storm of factors -- including larger floods and finer sediment size -- will enable these destructive events to occur farther and farther inland. Their results, which appear in On large, relatively flat rivers, avulsions tend to occur in the backwater region, Ganti explained. ""This is the zone over which the river flow feels the effect of the sea level."" This region begins at the river mouth and can extend relatively far inland. For instance, the Mississippi River's backwater reach stretches 500 kilometers from the coast.The team was looking through satellite and remote sensing data for historical avulsions and came across the unique deltas of Madagascar. The island has a host of short rivers that course down from the mountains carrying very fine sediment. This is due to the saprolitic soils -- loose, soft soils made of silt and disintegrating rock -- that dominate the country's highlands. Exacerbated by rampant deforestation on the island, the exposed soils feed the island's turbid, red rivers and make it one of the fastest eroding places on Earth, according to lead author Sam Brooke, a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Geography.Using multiple satellite images taken since the late 1970s, Brooke created time series animations that communicate just how fast Madagascar's river deltas are evolving. Using this data, he was able to obtain the rivers' discharge rates as well as the amount of time the channels remained full during floods.Combining the data with the satellite imagery led to a surprising conclusion. The avulsions weren't occurring anywhere near the rivers' backwater zones. ""[Instead, they were] about 20 times [farther] upstream,"" Brooke recalled, ""way outside of where we'd expect them to be based on [...models] using simple backwater scale."" The researchers realized they had to update their models of where avulsions occur on deltas.A better modelThe team's expanded theory boils down to a simple relationship. Two processes are at work in river channels -- the duration of floods, and the time it takes for the river to adjust to changes. The relative timescales of these phenomena dictate where avulsions occur.If floods are shorter than the time the river takes to adjust, then erosion and deposition are limited to the backwater zone. However, if floods last longer than it takes the river to adjust, erosion during floods can travel far upstream of the river mouth, which makes it possible for the river to avulse much farther inland.Large flat rivers, like the Mississippi, change slowly, but steep rivers with lots of fine sediment can adjust quite quickly. ""The whole channel can be resurfaced within the backwater zone in a given flood,"" said Ganti, ""and erosion can propagate much farther upstream."" This is the case for rivers like those in Madagascar, which are relatively steep and have a lot of fine sediment.A river floods when it's carrying enough water to overtop its banks. And for most of its length, a flooded waterway will do just that. But water level is constrained by sea level near the river's mouth up through the backwater zone. So the increased volume of water during floods begins moving faster, increasing erosion, and scouring the river bed deeper.This wave of erosion can then spread upstream as flood conditions continue, enabling the river to avulse far upstream from the backwater zone -- much farther than anticipated.A foreboding picture emerges""Climate models predict that extreme floods will occur more often in a warming world,"" said Ganti. As a result, avulsions could begin moving even farther inland on rivers around the world.But greenhouse gas emissions are not the only human activity affecting rivers. Sand and gravel are critical components in construction and infrastructure, and humans are now mining these resources on massive scales. Unfortunately, these make up the coarse fraction of alluvial sediment, which means that our activities are leading to finer sediment in many locations. Rivers can carry more of this fine-grained material, and the increased load reduces the amount of time it takes channels [?] to change. Once again, this enables avulsions to occur farther upstream.What's more, sea level rise is pushing the backwater zone itself farther inland. These three factors combine to create the perfect recipe for major avulsions to occur ever farther inland on deltas, Ganti explained. This could lead to an increasing trend of homes, lives and livelihoods lost due to extreme flooding, likely in locations that never had to deal with these hazards historically.And according to the team's previous paper these events will also become more frequent as the sea level rises.""We should brace ourselves for avulsion as a serious flood hazard in the future,"" Vamsi cautioned.River deltas have always been a critical resource for humanity, harnessed for agriculture, transportation and industry. Many of civilization's largest cities have grown along the banks of the world's great waterways. Their dynamism has always posed a challenge to society, but as rivers become less predictable and more volatile, researchers say, we will need to take more precautions to ensure our safety and wellbeing.",Climate,2020.0,"Sea level rise will cause rivers to jump course more often on deltas than in the past, according to a study by UC Santa Barbara geomorphologist Vamsi Ganti and his collaborators.

Daniel Rokhsar.Ocean acidification is one of the consequences of human-induced climate change and occurs when increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolve into the ocean, reacting with water to form carbonic acid. Acidic oceans detrimentally impact marine creatures in countless ways, from triggering coral bleaching to preventing marine organisms from building and maintaining their shells and skeletons.Pteropods are particularly vulnerable due to their aragonite shell, which over time has evolved to be thin and light-weight to suit their planktonic lifestyle. Aragonite is a highly soluble form of calcium carbonate. Dr. Marlétaz explained: ""When conditions in the ocean are too acidic, these fragile shells can completely dissolve, and they die. So, pteropods will likely be seriously threatened as oceans acidify.""This is an issue as pteropods play an important role in the ocean's ability to capture carbon as they use carbon dioxide to form their calcium carbonate shell. Pteropods are also commonly found in planktonic communities, so their loss could upset the delicate balance of the food webs in the open ocean.Many experimental studies are already testing the ability of pteropods to adapt to oceans with higher levels of carbon dioxide, but so far, little is known about their evolutionary history and how they might have responded to global changes in the past.To uncover their evolutionary history, Dr. Katja Peijnenburg from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the University of Amsterdam, pteropod expert and lead author of the study, collected samples of 21 different pteropod speciesfrom the Atlantic Ocean. The team then used these preserved samples to extract genetic information on 2654 genes. The researchers also included genetic data from three other species of pteropods and three species of sea slugs and snails that were closely related to pteropods.The scientists analyzed similarities and differences in the protein sequences of the genes shared across the species to construct an evolutionary tree. By calibrating the tree against pteropod fossils of a known date, the researchers could then calculate not only how, but when the main pteropod lineages diverged from a common ancestor to form new species.""We found that the origin of the pteropods dated back to the early Cretaceous period when the main lineages of sea butterflies and sea angels diverged from each other, with the other main lineages splitting apart in the mid to late Cretaceous. This was much longer ago than previous molecular data had suggested and predates the oldest known fossils,"" said Dr. Marlétaz.Importantly, this new date of origin and earlier diversification means that the main groups of currently existing pteropods experienced periods of dramatic environmental change that caused mass extinction.Unlike the majority of species then present on earth, pteropods survived the asteroid strike at the end of the Cretaceous period around 66 million years ago which infamously wiped out the dinosaurs.But more importantly, pteropods also overcame the challenges of the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, a period about 55.5 million years ago where massive amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere caused the earth to warm and the oceans to acidify.""The Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum was a period of crisis that was very similar to current changes we are seeing today,"" said Dr. Marlétaz. ""These findings offer some hope that over evolutionary timescales, pteropods are able to adapt and acclimatize to changes in ocean temperature and acidity.""However, Dr. Marlétaz also offered a word of caution. He explained that just because pteropods survived previous increases in ocean acidity, does not mean that they are necessarily resilient to the climate crisis occurring today.""What is striking with the changes we see now is that they are happening at a much more dramatic pace than previous events,"" he said. ""The main groups of pteropods have shown a robustness and ability to adapt over longer timescales, but the quicker the changes, the less chance these creatures have.""",Climate,2020.0,"Pteropods, also known as sea butterflies and sea angels, have survived past environmental crises and are much older than previously thought, according to a study published in Communications Biology.

The creatures play an important role in capturing carbon and maintaining the balance of food webs in the open ocean.

Briner led the collaborative study, coordinating the work of scientists from multiple disciplines and institutions.""If the world goes on a massive energy diet, in line with a scenario that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls RCP2.6, our model predicts that the Greenland Ice Sheet's rate of mass loss this century will be only slightly higher than anything experienced in the past 12,000 years,"" Briner adds. ""But, more worrisome, is that under a high-emissions RCP8.5 scenario -- the one the Greenland Ice Sheet is now following -- the rate of mass loss could be about four times the highest values experienced under natural climate variability over the past 12,000 years.""He and colleagues say the results reiterate the need for countries around the world to take action now to reduce emissions, slow the decline of ice sheets, and mitigate sea level rise. The research was largely funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.The study brought together climate modelers, ice core scientists, remote sensing experts and paleoclimate researchers at UB, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the University of Washington (UW), Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and other institutions.This multidisciplinary team used a state-of-the-art ice sheet model to simulate changes to the southwestern sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet, starting from the beginning of the Holocene epoch some 12,000 years ago and extending forward 80 years to 2100.Scientists tested the model's accuracy by comparing results of the model's simulations to historical evidence. The modeled results matched up well with data tied to actual measurements of the ice sheet made by satellites and aerial surveys in recent decades, and with field work identifying the ice sheet's ancient boundaries.Though the project focused on southwestern Greenland, research shows that changes in the rates of ice loss there tend to correspond tightly with changes across the entire ice sheet.""We relied on the same ice sheet model to simulate the past, the present and the future,"" says co-author Jessica Badgeley, a PhD student in the UW Department of Earth and Space Sciences. ""Thus, our comparisons of the ice sheet mass change through these time periods are internally consistent, which makes for a robust comparison between past and projected ice sheet changes.""""We have significantly improved our understanding of how anomalous future Greenland change will be,"" says co-author Joshua Cuzzone, PhD, an assistant project scientist at UCI who completed much of his work on the study as a postdoctoral researcher at JPL and UCI. ""This work represents a massive success for multidisciplinary science and collaboration, and represents a framework for future successful multidisciplinary work.""Cuzzone and other researchers at UCI and JPL led ice sheet modeling, leveraging the work of colleagues at UW, who used data from ice cores to create maps of temperatures and precipitation in the study region that were used to drive the ice sheet model simulations up to the year 1850. Previously published climate data was used to drive the simulations after that date.UB and LDEO scientists partnered on field work that helped validate the model by identifying the ice sheet's boundaries in southwestern Greenland thousands of years ago.""We built an extremely detailed geologic history of how the margin of the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet moved through time by measuring beryllium-10 in boulders that sit on moraines,"" says co-author Nicolás Young, PhD, associate research professor at LDEO. ""Moraines are large piles of debris that you can find on the landscape that mark the former edge of an ice sheet or glacier. A beryllium-10 measurement tells you how long that boulder and moraine have been sitting there, and therefore tells you when the ice sheet was at that exact spot and deposited that boulder.""Amazingly, the model reproduced the geologic reconstruction really well. This gave us confidence that the ice sheet model was performing well and giving us meaningful results. You can model anything you want and your model will always spit out an answer, but we need some way to determine if the model is doing a good job.""The study makes an important contribution by creating a timeline of the past, present and future of the Greenland Ice Sheet, Briner says. The results are sobering.""We have long timelines of temperature change, past to present to future, that show the influence of greenhouse gases on Earth's temperature,"" Briner says. ""And now, for the first time, we have a long timeline of the impacts of that temperature -- in the form of Greenland Ice Sheet melt -- from the past to present to future. And what it shows is eye-opening.""""It is no secret that the Greenland Ice Sheet is in rough shape and is losing ice at an increasing rate,"" Young says. ""But if someone wants to poke holes in this, they could simply ask, 'how do you know this isn't just part of the ice sheet's natural variability?' Well, what our study suggests is that the rate of ice loss for this century will exceed the rate of ice loss for any single century over the last 12,000 years. I think this is the first time that the current health of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been robustly placed into a long-term context.""Despite these sobering results, one vital takeaway from the model's future projections is that it's still possible for people and countries around the world to make an important difference by cutting emissions, Briner says. Models of the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios yield very different results, with high-emission scenarios producing massive declines in the ice sheet's health, and significant sea level rise.""Our findings are yet another wake-up call, especially for countries like the U.S.,"" Briner says. ""Americans use more energy per person than any other nation in the world. Our nation has produced more of the CO2 that resides in the atmosphere today than any other country. Americans need to go on an energy diet. The most affluent Americans, who have the highest energy footprint, can afford to make lifestyle changes, fly less, install solar panels and drive an energy-efficient vehicle.""""This study shows that future ice loss is likely to be larger than anything that the ice sheet experienced in the Holocene -- unless we follow a low-carbon emission scenario in the future,"" Badgeley says.",Climate,2020.0,"The Greenland Ice Sheet's rate of mass loss this century could be four times higher than the highest values experienced under natural climate variability over the past 12,000 years, according to a study by researchers from multiple institutions.

But in Humboldt squids, DNA markers showed no north-south divide. The equator doesn't serve as a natural barrier to separate the different genetic stocks of these fast swimmers risking capture by different fishery fleets along their migration route.""In our study, we identify at least two genetic stocks co-distributed in the north and southern hemisphere of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Our results suggest that rather than independent marine policies from each country, the sustainability of this squid requires an international marine policy,"" Sanchez said.To ensure sustainable fishing, countries in South America where the squid is traditionally found have established yearly catch quotas. But the study found this approach to be ineffective, especially as catch restrictions are absent in international waters on the squid's migration path.""Countries fishing this squid have established catch quotas with no consideration that the total amount varies from year to year, and that the amount of squid caught influences the number of squids next year. By doing so, the genetic contribution of the offspring every year will also clearly fluctuate. In such a situation, there is a risk of having a genetic erosion with a smaller number of squids which are also less likely to adapt rapidly to the changing environment,"" he remarked.""From our study, it is also clear that the squids caught by different countries also belong at least two different populations, with likely different genetic contribution for the next generation. Catching these squids without knowing that their genetic contribution is different, is also very risky.""Both warm tropical waters and the cooler Humboldt current, which runs from Tierra del Fuego at the southernmost tip of the South American mainland upwards to the northern coast of Peru, play a role in the Humboldt squid's life cycle.The squid seeks warm waters near the equator to spawn its clusters of neutrally buoyant eggs. But it needs nutrient-rich cool waters where they go on a feeding frenzy to grow from one-millimeter paralarvae specks to enormous predators of over 1.2 meters long.These squids typically spawn only once during their one-year lifespan then die, making their future volatile if fishing goes unchecked. And such fears are not farfetched.It's eastern relatives, the Japanese flying squid, has suffered the same fate. Years of overfishing, poor regulatory oversight, and the changing climate have depleted their population at an alarming rate that yearly catch of Japanese fishermen dropped over 70% from more than 200,000 tons in 2011 to 53,000 tons in 2017. The shortage worries the fishing town of Hakodate whose identity and economy are intertwined with the squid.""The population of the Japanese flying squids has decreased, and this is because along the distribution of this squid you have a lot of fleets from Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan, some with high capacity for catching this squid. Countries like China with massive distant-water fishing fleets can move anywhere outside their national jurisdiction to catch this squid. If you have the technology you can go to international waters and catch anything,"" Sanchez said.He said Hakodate's experience could be a grim warning of things to come for his country Peru.""The Humboldt squid is the second most important economical species in Peru. That means that when we have less squid, that will affect also the economy of the country, particularly the economy of the fisherman that depends on this squid,"" he said.Over 90 percent of warming on Earth in the past 50 years has happened in the ocean and the speed it is heating up is accelerating. Warming oceans due to climate change have driven sea creatures toward the poles.The Humboldt squid population itself has expanded its migratory path. It recently stretched its route farther north to Alaska and south to the tip of Chile which exposes these cephalopods that hunt in packs of up to 1,200 to fishing boats in each territory on its path as well as technologically advanced vessels waiting in international waters.Sanchez's team found a similar pattern of historical population expansion under extreme climate conditions when they looked at the mitochondrial DNA of the squid. They found that warming global temperatures 30,000 years ago which thawed Ice Age glaciers contributed to a sea-level rise favorable for the Humboldt squid population to spread out. The event which coincided with the decrease in the population of sperm whales, their natural predators, led to a population expansion for the squids.Although quick to adapt, warmer temperatures mean less food, smaller maturity size, and fewer eggs to replenish its population.Much, including its conservation status, is still unknown of this large squid species. But with its economic significance to fishing communities and its important role in the marine ecosystem as food for diverse species, the new knowledge of its genetic stock can help inform future marine policies to manage its population.""The Humboldt squid is the largest squid fishery in the world and is heavily caught in the Eastern Pacific Ocean by several countries, including countries from Asia like Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. This squid is one of the most commercial squids in the world, and it sustains the economy of many countries.""""Identifying genetic stocks, also known as genetically different groups, throughout population genetics is very important for implementing marine policies that control the total catch of this squid. The high migratory capacity of this squid is the main challenge to identify the exact number of genetic stocks, and more genetic resources and sampling are required to clearly reveal this number.""",Climate,2020.0,"Marine biologists from Hiroshima University have identified at least two genetic stocks of Humboldt squid in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, which are homogeneously co-distributed in the northern and southern hemispheres.

Garrett Boudinot, lead author and recent PhD graduate in the Department of Geological Sciences.Boudinot analyzed samples from a rock core that spans what is known as the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) in the Cretaceous period, about 94 million years ago. He found that an increased amount of carbon buried in the oceans at the start of this event was associated with indications for the occurrence of wildfires, which might have been caused by an increase in oxygen in the atmosphere.""One of the consequences of having more oxygen in the atmosphere is that it's easier to burn fires,"" said Boudinot. ""It's the same reason you blow on embers to stoke a fire.""Large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- much like what Earth is projected to experience by 2100 -- kick-started this cycle.For 50,000 years before the OAE2 began, algae and land plants drew down this carbon into the oceans through photosynthesis, causing microbial respiration to increase, which led parts of the oceans to become low in or even devoid of oxygen, known as anoxia. This same process exists today in waters where too many nutrients end up in one place, like the mouth of the Mississippi River, where excess fertilizer runoff accumulates and feeds algae -- which are then eaten up by microbes that consume oxygen, creating a dead zone. In these kinds of anoxic waters, the organic carbon that is stored from the atmosphere is buried in sediments, while the oxygen that was part of the carbon dioxide (CO2) is released to the atmosphere.After 100,000 years of this ocean anoxia event -- which was intensified by warming temperatures -- oceans sediments around the globe had stored enough organic carbon that the atmosphere became rich in oxygen, so much so that it might have facilitated the burning of up to 40 percent of forests across the planet, even in wet and humid regions.The planet is undergoing a similar transformation today as it did at the beginning of this cycle, with carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere and nutrients building up in the ocean. If these same patterns continue, history could repeat itself in the future, only centuries to millennia from today.""It highlights that putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and nutrients into the ocean doesn't just potentially increase global temperatures. It has significant impacts on the fundamental biogeochemistry or ecology of the planet, like how forests respond to fire,"" said Boudinot, who now works in outreach at the Colorado Wildlife Council.A mystery in Earth's historyBoudinot never intended to analyze the rock core, drilled in Utah, for remnants of forest fires. It was drilled to better understand other various elements of OAE2, including how marine ecosystems responded to global change at that time in Earth's history.But he was also running another experiment at the same time, using an analytical method to identify molecular tracers of forest fires in rock samples from other times and locations. These tracers are called polycyclic, aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs -- sometimes known as ""pyro PAHs.""Within the Utah rock core were black shales laden with organic matter preserved from almost 94 million years ago, when that part of the country was covered with sea. So Boudinot thought why not? And ran these same tests on the OAE2 rock core, finding there were a significant amount of these pyro PAHs in it.""These organic molecules basically serve as molecular fossils,"" said Julio Sepúlveda, senior author on the study, professor of geological sciences and fellow in the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research.These molecules are also related to the temperature of the fire itself. They indicated high temperature fires, created by forest fires.The interval of OAE2 with more fires has also been something of a mystery to geologists. Not only is this new geochemical data rock solid, but it also represents a detailed evolution of the event -- with each data point representing a smaller period of time. This gives scientists a clearer understanding of how carbon storage in the oceans is related to oxygen levels in the atmosphere and global temperatures, and the pace at which these climate feedbacks can occur.While scientists suspect volcanic activity as the reason there was so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere before this event in Earth's history began, Boudinot sees parallels to how much carbon dioxide humans are emitting today.""This finding highlights the prolonged impacts of climate change. The climate change that we're causing now, it's not something where if we don't fix it, only our grandkids will have to deal with it,"" said Boudinot. ""The history of climate change in Earth history tells us that the impacts are really long lasting.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study published in the journal Geology reveals that an increase in oxygen in the atmosphere caused by large amounts of carbon dioxide during the Cretaceous period, about 94 million years ago, led to an increase in wildfires.

Not exactly, according to new research from University of Illinois scientists, who urge the scientific community to redefine the term.","""Plants have to balance water supply and demand. Both are extremely critical, but people overlook the demand side of the equation, especially in the U.S. Corn Belt,"" says Kaiyu Guan, principal investigator on two new studies, Blue Waters professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at Illinois.The demand Guan refers to is atmospheric dryness, often expressed as vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The drier the air, the more moisture is sucked out of pores, or stomata, in plant leaves. Plants have to open stomata to take in carbon dioxide as their food, but if they sense the atmosphere is too dry, they'll close pores to avoid drying out. Keeping stomata closed too long leads to reductions in photosynthesis, plant growth, and grain yield.The kicker? Plants shut down stomata due to atmospheric dryness even when there's an adequate supply of moisture in the soil.""If you only consider rainfall and soil moisture, which is how most people think about drought, that's mostly describing the supply side. Of course if you have low soil moisture, plants will be stressed by how much water they get. But the supply is often pretty sufficient, especially here in the U.S. Corn Belt,"" Guan says. ""However, the demand side from the atmosphere can also severely stress plants. We need to pay more attention to that drought signal.""Guan's two recent studies used multiple technological approaches, including field measurements, various sources of satellite data, hydrological model simulations, and government crop yield statistics. The first study, published in ""By comparison, soil moisture typically accounts for 6-13% of these measures for corn and soybean, and up to 35% when considering time lag effects,"" says Hyungsuk Kimm, doctoral student in Guan's group and the study's lead author.In the other study, published in the ""This led us to build a new drought index integrating VPD, soil moisture, and measures of evapotranspiration, which can account for more than 70% of yield variation. Our index outperforms all the existing drought indices,"" says Wang Zhou, postdoctoral researcher in Guan's group and the study's lead author.Guan adds, ""In these two studies, we tried to understand the demand side of drought from two major angles, one using eddy covariance data which measures landscape water and carbon use very accurately -- the gold standard -- and the other leveraging satellite data and model-simulated hydrological variables correlated with regional yield,"" Guan says. ""In both, we demonstrate VPD is more important than soil moisture to explain the crop drought response in the U.S. Midwest.""Adjusting the drought concept for crops will be critical for global food security under a changing climate.""When we look at climate change scenarios, the amount of rainfall is not changing much for the Corn Belt, but we for sure know temperature and VPD will increase here. That means not much will change on the supply side, but demand stress will increase significantly. And that type of stress is so connected to end-of-season crop yield,"" Guan says.His group is working on follow-up studies evaluating the role of irrigation in increasing supply and decreasing demand, but for now, Guan says breeding for improved water-use-efficiency could be an important part of the solution.",Climate,2020.0,"Two new studies led by Kaiyu Guan, Blue Waters professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at Illinois, have revealed that atmospheric dryness is a major stressor for crops, even when soil moisture levels are adequate.

Alterations in marine species distributions in response to warming and sea ice reduction are likely to increase the susceptibility and vulnerability of Arctic ecosystems. The findings, published by Hokkaido University researchers in the journal Fisheries oceanographer Irene Alabia of Hokkaido University's Arctic Research Center along with colleagues in Japan and the US investigated how future climate changes will impact the marine biodiversity in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. These seas extend from Alaska to Russia in the northern Pacific and southern Arctic oceans.""This area forms a 'biogeographical transition zone': a biodiversity-rich region covering two distinct areas with specific features that encourage the coexistence of species living at or close to their distribution limits,"" explains Alabia. ""These zones are vulnerable to climate warming, and climatic disruptions can create favorable conditions for the shift of warm-water species into previously colder-water zones.""Scientists are interested in understanding how species in biogeographical transition zones are responding to climate changes and other human impacts. This information could help in conservation planning, fisheries management, and in studying the role of evolutionary history in shaping currently existing communities.Alabia and her team mapped the present and future spatial distributions of 26 fish and invertebrate species in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Using species records, sea surface temperature, and sea ice concentration data, the authors developed species distribution models to predict the distributional ranges under the present-day (1993-2017) and future (2026-2100) climate conditions. From the model outputs, the changes in species richness and compositional diversity in terms of species' phylogeny and functional traits between time periods and across contrasting levels of warming were elucidated.The findings suggest that larger, longer-lived and more predatory fish and invertebrates will expand their ranges towards the pole in response to warming waters and sea ice free conditions by the end of the 21st century.

Processes like volcano eruptions, mountain building and erosion are responsible for moving carbon through Earth's atmosphere, surface and mantle.In March 2019, a team led by UC Santa Barbara's Francis Macdonald published a study proposing that tectonic activity in the tropics, and subsequent chemical weathering by the abundant rainfall, could account for the majority of carbon capture over million-year timeframes.Now, Macdonald, doctoral student Eliel Anttila and their collaborators have applied their new model to the emergence of the Southeast Asian archipelago -- comprising New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other nearby islands -- over the past 15 million years. Using data from the paleo-record, they determined that the islands are a modern hotspot of carbon dioxide consumption. Their results, published in the The primary means by which carbon is recycled into the planet's interior is through the breakdown of silicate rocks, especially rocks high in calcium and magnesium. Raindrops absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and bring it to the surface. As the droplets patter against the stone, the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the rocks, releasing the calcium and magnesium into rivers and the ocean. These ions then react with dissolved carbon in the ocean and form carbonate compounds like calcite, which consolidates on the sea floor, trapping the atmospheric carbon for tens of millions of years or longer.Given the right conditions, and enough time, the deep carbon cycle can lock away enough carbon to plunge Earth into an ice age. ""Last year we found that there was a nice correlation between when we make a bunch of mountains in the tropical rain belt and when we have cooling events,"" said Macdonald, a professor in the Department of Earth Science.Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere spiked in the mid-Miocene climatic maximum, around 15 million years ago. Although there is still some uncertainty, scientists believe that atmospheric COToday we are around 411 ppm, and climbing, Macdonald pointed out.Around that time, the Eurasian and Australian plates began colliding and creating the Southeast Asian archipelago and few of the present islands were emergent above sea-level. ""This is the most recent example of an arc-continent collision in the tropics,"" Macdonald noted, ""and throughout this period we actually have proxy data for the change in COThe team was curious how large an effect the emergence of the islands may have had on the climate. Based on their previous hypothesis, the formation of these largely volcanic rock provinces in the tropics should be a major factor in determining COThey applied geological data of ancient shorelines and lithology to a joint weathering and climate model, which accounted for four major variables: latitude, topography, total area and rock type. In the tropics, a more mountainous region will experience more rain, and have a greater surface area for weathering to occur. Once the surface rocks are weathered, the combination of erosion and uplift exposes fresh rock.""What you need to do is just keep removing that soil, keep getting fresh rock there, and keep dissolving it,"" explained Macdonald. ""So having active tectonic topography is key. All of Southeast Asia has active topography, and this is a big reason why it's just so much more effective at breaking rocks down into their constituent ions so they can join into the geochemical cycles.""The team's analysis bore this out. They found that weathering, uplift, and erosion just in the Southeast Asian islands could have accounted for most of the drop in COThese findings could provide insights on our current climate crisis. ""The reason scientists are so interested in understanding the Miocene is because we think of this as perhaps the best natural analogue to what the world may look like at a CO""People should be worried not necessarily about the amplitude of the increase, but the slope,"" added Anttila. ""That's that real problem right now."" Humans have moved a comparable amount of carbon into the atmosphere in just a few generations as it took the Earth to pull out of the atmosphere over millions of years.""You realize that we are more effective than any geological processes at geoengineering,"" Macdonald said.The team is currently developing a model and looking at the rocks themselves to reevaluate previous hypotheses for the initial cooling. By a stroke of good fortune, the original specimens used to develop these hypotheses are from the Monterey Formation, a layer of rock that crops up throughout the Santa Barbara basin. These rocks dominate cliff faces from Santa Barbara to Goleta Pier and from Coal Oil Point to Gaviota.""We've got this amazing opportunity right here to reconstruct this time period, right in our backyard,"" said Macdonald.""These records of going from a warmer climate in the Miocene to the cooler climate of today are recorded right here in the cliffs,"" he added.

""There are other trends we noticed in the satellite data that tell us how the Arctic fire regime is changing and what this spells for our climate future.""The scientists contend that input and expertise of Indigenous and other local and communities is essential to understanding and managing this global issue.The commentary identifies two new features of recent Arctic fires. The first is the prevalence of holdover fires, also called zombie fires. Fire from a previous growing season can smolder in carbon-rich peat underground over the winter, then re-ignite on the surface as soon as the weather warms in spring.""We know little about the consequences of holdover fires in the Arctic,"" noted Turetsky, ""except that they represent momentum in the climate system and can mean that severe fires in one year set the stage for more burning the next summer.""The second feature is the new occurrence of fire in fire-resistant landscapes. As tundra in the far north becomes hotter and drier under the influence of a warmer climate, vegetation types not typically thought of as fuels are starting to catch fire: dwarf shrubs, sedges, grass, moss, even surface peats. Wet landscapes like bogs, fens, and marshes are also becoming vulnerable to burning.The team has been tracking fire activity in the Russian Arctic in real time using a variety of satellite and remote sensing tools. While wildfires on permafrost in Siberia south of the Arctic are not uncommon, the team found that 2019 and 2020 stood out as extreme in the satellite record for burning that occurred well above the Arctic Circle, a region not normally known to support large wildfires.As a result, said lead author Dr. Jessica McCarty, a geographer and fire scientist at Miami University, ""Arctic fires are burning earlier and farther north, in landscapes previously thought to be fire resistant.""The consequences of this new fire regime could be significant for the Arctic landscape and peoples and for the global climate. More than half of the fires detected in Siberia this year were north of the Arctic Circle on permafrost with a high percentage of ground ice. This type of permafrost locks in enormous amounts of carbon from ancient biomass. Climate models don't account for the rapid thaw of these environments and resulting release of greenhouse gases, including methane.On a more local level, abrupt thawing of ice-rich permafrost in wildfires causes subsidence, floods, pits and craters, and can submerge large areas under lakes and wetlands. As well as disrupting the lives and livelihoods of Arctic residents, these features are associated with more greenhouse gases moving from where they are trapped in soils into the atmosphere.These extensive changes have severe consequences for global climate.""Nearly all of this year's fires inside the Arctic Circle have occurred on continuous permafrost, with over half of these burning on ancient carbon-rich peat soils,"" said Dr. Thomas Smith, a fire scientist at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a coauthor of the study. ""The record high temperatures and associated fires have the potential to turn this important carbon sink into a carbon source, driving further global heating.""The severity of the 2020 Arctic fires emphasizes an urgent need to better understand a switch in Arctic fire regimes. New tools and approaches are required to measure how fires start and measure fire extent. Modeling tools and remote sensing data can help, but only if paired with local, specialized knowledge about where legacy carbon stored in peats or permafrost is vulnerable to burning and how environments change after wildfires.The commentary cautions that this issue is so important to the climate system that it must be taken up as an issue of global importance.

These extremes can be particularly damaging for agricultural production and ecosystems, they warn.According to the researchers, the trigger for these hot-dry events is shifting. Looking back at the catastrophic Dust Bowl of the 1930s, they explain that the dust storms were driven by a lack of rainfall coupled with poor land management practices. In recent decades, however, dry-hot disasters are driven more often by excess heat than a lack of rainfall.The future will bring us more of these disasters, if the current warming trends continue, the researchers caution.

""Simply moving dates earlier to track climate change isn't necessarily risk free. Riskier conditions earlier in the year can expose animals to unintended consequences when responding to bouts of unusually warm spring weather,"" says Ryan Shipley, postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and first author on the paper.","In recent years, studies have raised concerns about whether or not species can adapt, or ""keep pace"" with climate change. Particular emphasis has been placed on phenology -- the timing of life cycle events such as breeding and migration -- and the importance of adjusting this to track rising temperatures and earlier arrivals of spring. But the authors say that breeding earlier may place animals at greater risk of exposure to inclement weather events that tend to occur more frequently earlier in the year. They found that Tree Swallows had been advancing breeding by three days every decade for the last 30 years, but earlier-hatching offspring were at greater risk of exposure to inclement weather, which in turn reduced the availability of the flying insects they rely on for food.""Our results raise the possibility that animals relying on food resources that can rapidly change in abundance due to the weather may be particularly at risk to climate change,"" says Shipley. The study has exposed strong fitness consequences for birds that are advancing breeding at a similar rate to climate change. But it may also provide clues to the mystery of why aerial insectivorous birds, such as swallows, swifts, flycatchers, and nightjars, are declining faster than other groups in much of North America and Europe. Weather in spring can change quickly and tends to be more unpredictable earlier in the year.The activity of flying insects is determined by weather, which means they are stochastically available. ""For birds that feed on flying insects, one day is feast, the next is famine. This means during unusually warm springs, parents are betting current conditions that prompt earlier egg laying are indicative of similar good conditions for rearing hatched young three weeks in the future,"" says Shipley.The results lay bare a previously unobserved threat to aerial insectivorous birds. ""Considerable attention has been given to potential widespread decline of insect populations and this might be hitting insectivorous birds particularly hard. But we show a mechanism that doesn't require change in insect abundance -- just availability over short time, like a few days.""The researchers studied a population of Tree Swallows in Ithaca, New York, that have been the focus of a remarkable 30-year experiment -- studies of this length are rare in the field of ornithology.

It was not clear to what extent carbon emissions from deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth, or how this has varied over time.A new study by an international team of researchers from the UK and Brazil, published by After calculating how much carbon had been lost through deforestation, the scientists discovered that, in more than 30 years, the regrowth of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon has offset less than 10 per cent of emissions from the loss of old-growth forests.Charlotte Smith, a PhD researcher at Lancaster University and lead author of the study, said: ""Secondary forests have an incredible potential to store large quantities of carbon. However, it takes a long time for them to build this carbon stock, so without a drastic decline in the rate of deforestation their environmental benefits will continue to be undermined.""Despite a fifth of deforested land now being covered in secondary forest, the researchers found that most secondary forests are relatively young -- more than 85 per cent are younger than 20 years old and almost half (42 per cent) are less than five years old.This is because secondary forests are also subject to deforestation. Areas of land have been repeatedly deforested -- thus limiting secondary forests' effectiveness as a carbon store. ""Of all the secondary forest mapped over the 32-year period, 60 per cent had been deforested again by 2017,"" said Charlotte.The researchers then looked at other factors known to affect secondary forest growth and carbon up-take, such as climate, landscape and proximity to old-growth forests, which can act as a source of seeds.They found that the majority of secondary forests are situated far from primary forests, in the drier parts of the Amazon. These factors suggest they will be relatively poor for taking-up carbon.The findings highlight that halting deforestation, particularly of old-growth forest, is essential and that secondary forest growth alone is not sufficient to control carbon emissions in the Amazon.Co-author, Professor Jos Barlow, said: ""Although secondary forests could be an important part of the solution to climate change, it is also important not to overstate their relevance. Deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon surpassed 10,000km2 last year, and will almost certainly surpass that in 2020.""The researchers hope that these results will help inform policies and management proposals that can mitigate climate change more effectively.

Ghost forests are areas where rising seas have killed off freshwater-dependent trees, leaving dead or dying white snags standing in marsh.","The study found that the transition from forest to marsh along the coastline of the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula led to a significant loss in the amount of carbon stored in the plants and trees above ground. When released into the atmosphere as a gas, carbon can contribute to global warming. However, researchers also uncovered some ways landowners can offset some of those carbon losses.""Many people think about sea-level rise as being more of a long-term threat,"" said the study's lead author Lindsey Smart, a research associate at the North Carolina State University Center for Geospatial Analytics. ""But we're actually seeing significant changes over shorter time periods because of this interaction between gradual sea-level rise and extreme weather events like hurricanes or droughts, which can bring salt water further inland.""In the study, researchers tracked the spread of ghost forests across 2,485 square miles on the peninsula. They found that on unmanaged, or natural, land such as publicly owned wildlife areas, ghost forests spread across 15 percent of the area between 2001 and 2014.Using models created using data on vegetation height and type in the area, they calculated that across the 13 years of the study, 130,000 metric tons of carbon were lost from the spread of ghost forests on unmanaged land.According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, that's equivalent to what would be emitted into the air by 102,900 passenger vehicles driven for one year.""Coastal forests are really unique in that they store carbon both in their foliage, and in their really rich organic soil,"" Smart said. ""As saltwater intrusion increases, you're going to see impacts both to the aboveground and the belowground carbon. While we measured aboveground carbon losses, the next step will be to look at the response of these carbon stores below ground to saltwater exposure.""Researchers said it's unclear exactly what happens to the carbon released when the forests are killed by salt water, and it could be that it goes into the soil.While they found ghost forests spread along the peninsula's coastline, they also saw that the losses at the coast were offset by tree plantings in forests grown for timber during the study.That was one land-management practice that they found could offset carbon losses due to ghost forest spread. They also saw that the use of canals and drainage ditches had an impact on carbon losses. Canals could either aid saltwater encroachment on the land, or help prevent it, depending on their use.""Drainage networks, if not maintained, can serve as conduits for saltwater intrusion,"" Smart said.They also reported that catastrophic wildfires likely worsened the spread of ghost forest along the coast and had a greater impact on the loss of aboveground carbon compared with ghost forest spread.""We think there may be an interaction between salt water and fire that accelerates forest retreat, and facilitates marsh migration into areas that were once healthy coastal forest,"" Smart said.The researchers said drought also played a role in ghost forest spreads.""Two severe droughts within the study period produced larger-than-typical wildfires and facilitated salinization of normally freshwater ecosystems,"" said study co-author Paul Taillie, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida and former graduate student at N.C.

At the end of the day, this paper addresses some fundamental questions of how humans depend on nature for their wellbeing.""Climate economic models typically represent the economy as made of two building blocks: human capital (labor) and manufactured capital, such as buildings and machines. This study incorporates a third building block -- natural capital -- which comprises the natural systems and healthy habitats for species. Natural capital translates into tangible benefits for people, such as erosion control, and intangible benefits, such as preserving forests for future generations.""If lost, such natural processes cannot easily be replaced or substituted,"" said lead author Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, a Ph.D. candidate in the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group. ""The associated economic costs of that loss are damaging in a way not currently represented in climate economic models or policy.""The authors found that under plausible assumptions about how natural capital supports economic production and human welfare, climate damage to natural systems warrants rapid mitigation. Most previous analysis has ignored the pathways by which natural systems support welfare and their unique vulnerability to climate change -- potentially missing a critical piece of climate damages.Federal agencies use the ""social cost of carbon"" to represent the long-term damage done by a ton of CO2 emissions in a given year. The metric is widely used in cost-benefit analyses of climate and energy policy. Yet standard estimates only roughly account for ecological damages and do not fully account for the unique and long-term costs of climate impacts on natural systems. Because of this, the study finds that the federal social cost of carbon may well be far too low.""With this new framework, we are more aware of the need to limit emissions,"" Bastien-Olvera said.

However, when the ocean is stable, the layers of the ocean do not mix. Cooler, oxygenated water from beneath does not rise up and deliver oxygen and nutrients to waters near the surface, and warm surface water does not absorb carbon dioxide and bury it at depth.""The same process, global warming, is both making the atmosphere less stable and the oceans more stable,"" said Michael Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric sciences and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State. ""Water near the ocean's surface is warming faster than the water below. That makes the oceans become more stable.""Just as hot air rises, as is seen in the formation of towering clouds, hot water rises as well because it is less dense than cold water. If the hottest water is on top, vertical mixing in the oceans slows. Also, melting ice from various glaciers introduces fresh water into the upper layers of the oceans. Fresh water is less dense than salt water and so it tends to remain on the surface as well. Both elevated temperature and salinity cause greater ocean stratification and less ocean mixing.""The ability of the oceans to bury heat from the atmosphere and mitigate global warming is made more difficult when the ocean becomes more stratified and there is less mixing,"" said Mann. ""Less downward mixing of warming waters means the ocean surface warms even faster, leading, for example, to more powerful hurricanes. Global climate models underestimate these trends.""Mann and his team are not the first to investigate the impact of a warming climate on ocean stratification, but they are looking at the problem in a different way. The team has gone deeper into the ocean than previous research and they have a more sophisticated method of dealing with gaps in the data. They report their results today (Sept. 29) in ""Other researchers filled in gaps in the data with long-term averages,"" said Mann. ""That tends to suppress any trends that are present. We used an ocean model to fill in the gaps, allowing the physics of the model to determine the most likely values of the missing data points.""According to Mann, this is a more dynamic approach.""Using the more sophisticated physics-based method, we find that ocean stability is increasing faster than we thought before and faster than models predict, with worrying potential consequences,"" he said.",Climate,2020.0,"Global warming is causing the atmosphere to become less stable and the oceans to become more stable, according to Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric sciences and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State.

A remarkable example of adaptation to life in the open ocean, these mesmerizing animals can have thin shells and a snail foot transformed into two wing-like structures that enable them to ""fly"" through the water.Sea butterflies have been a focus for global change research because they make their shells of aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate that is 50 percent more soluble than calcite, which other important open ocean organisms use to construct their shells. As their shells are susceptible to dissolving in more acidified ocean water, pteropods have been called ""canaries in the coal mine,"" or sentinel species that signal the impact of ocean acidification.With some pteropods having thin shells and others having only partial or absent shells, such as the sea angels, their fossil record is patchy. Abundant pteropod fossils are only known from 56 million years ago onward and mostly represent the fully-shelled sea butterflies.

This revealed colder and warmer periods that they then compared with records for very large volcanic eruptions as well as major historical events.Crucial to the accuracy of the dataset was the use of the same number of data points across the entire 2000 years. Previous reconstructions of climate over this extended period have been biased by over-representation of trees from more recent times.The results, reported in the journal Instead, the researchers say, the study contributes to our understanding of the natural causes and societal consequences of summer temperature changes over the past two thousand years.""There is so much we can determine about past climate conditions from the information in tree rings, but we have far more information from newer trees than we do for trees which lived a thousand years or more ago,"" said Professor Ulf Büntgen from Cambridge's Department of Geography, the study's lead author. ""Removing some of the data from the more recent past levels the playing field for the whole 2000-year period we're looking at, so in the end, we gain a more accurate understanding of natural versus anthropogenic climate change.""Comparing the data from tree rings against evidence from ice cores, the researchers were able to identify the effect of past volcanic eruptions on summer temperatures.Large volcanic eruptions can lower global average temperatures by fractions of a degree Celsius, with strongest effects in parts of North America and Eurasia. The main factor is the amount of sulphur emitted during the eruption that reaches the stratosphere, where it forms minute particles that block some sunlight from reaching the surface. This can result in shorter growing seasons and cooler temperatures, that lead in turn to reduced harvests. Conversely, in periods when fewer large eruptions occurred, the Earth is able to absorb more heat from the Sun and temperatures rise.""Some climate models assume that the effect of volcanoes is punctuated and short,"" said Büntgen. ""However, if you look at the cumulative effect over a whole century, this effect can be much longer. In part, we can explain warm conditions during the 3rd, 10th and 11th centuries through a comparative lack of eruptions.""Reconstructed summer temperatures in the 280s, 990s and 1020s, when volcanic forcing was low, were comparable to modern conditions until 2010.Compared with existing large-scale temperature reconstructions of the past 1200-2000 years, the study reveals a greater pre-industrial summer temperature variability, including strong evidence for the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA) in the 6th and 7th centuries.Then, working with historians, the scientists found that relatively constant warmth during Roman and medieval periods, when large volcanic eruptions were less frequent, often coincided with societal prosperity and political stability in Europe and China. However, the periods characterised by more prolific volcanism often coincided with times of conflict and economic decline.""Interpreting history is always challenging,"" said Dr Clive Oppenheimer, the lead volcanologist of the study. ""So many factors come into play -- politics, economics, culture. But a big eruption that leads to widespread declines in grain production can hurt millions of people. Hunger can lead to famine, disease, conflict and migration. We see much evidence of this in the historical record.""We knew that large eruptions could have these effects, especially when societies were already stressed, but I was surprised to see the opposite effect so clearly in our data -- that centuries with rather few eruptions had warmer summers than the long-term average.""The new temperature reconstructions provide deeper insights into historical periods in which climactic changes, and their associated environmental responses, have had an outsized impact on human history. This has clear implications for our present and future. As climate change accelerates, extreme events, such as floods, drought, storms and wildfires, will become more frequent.""Humans have no effect on whether or not a volcano erupts, but the warming trend we are seeing right now is certainly related to human activity,"" said Büntgen.

Other measurements include record high temperatures, wind speeds, and the impact of tropical cyclones, including the deadliest in history.Extreme measurements like that in Greenland undergo a rigorous review process to make sure they are accurate and there is agreement with other meteorological data and weather forecast models. Due to the quality and preservation of the AWS station data provided by the Antarctic Meteorological Research Center, the WMO was able to verify the 1991 temperature and log it as part of the official record.According to Weidner, this cold temperature was the result of several atmospheric conditions converging in a specific way.The Klinck field site, where the coldest temperature was measured, is located in the middle of Greenland at an elevation of 10,170 feet (3,100 meters). Extreme cold air temperatures can occur when there is little wind to disturb an area, accompanied by clear skies.In this case, the elevation and a splitting of the jet stream -- which usually flows over the Greenland ice sheet -- created a dead zone, allowing the already cold region to continue losing heat from the Earth. Similar conditions occur over Canada and result in the famed (or infamous) ""polar vortex,"" which produces extreme cold that reaches the U.S.For more than 40 years, the network of more than 60 Automatic Weather Station sites has helped provide real-time data for scientists in extreme places like Antarctica and Greenland and has helped build a more complete picture of changes in Earth's climate.

In recent years, heatwaves of this kind have caused considerable changes to the ecosystems in the open seas and at the coast. Their list of negative effects is long: Marine heatwaves can lead to increased mortality among birds, fish and marine mammals, they can trigger harmful algal blooms, and greatly reduce the supply of nutrients in the ocean. Heatwaves also lead to coral bleaching, trigger movements of fish communities to colder waters, and may contribute to the sharp decline of the polar icecaps.","Researchers led by Bern-based marine scientist Charlotte Laufkötter have been investigating the question of how anthropogenic climate change has been affecting major marine heatwaves in recent decades. In a study recently published in the well-known scientific journal In its investigations, the Bern team studied satellite measurements of the sea surface temperature between 1981 and 2017. It was found that in the first decade of the study period, 27 major heatwaves occurred which lasted 32 days on average. They reached maximum temperatures of 4.8 degrees Celsius above the long-term average temperature. In the most recent decade to be analyzed, however, 172 major events occurred, lasting an average of 48 days and reaching peaks of 5.5 degrees above the long-term average temperature. The temperatures in the sea usually fluctuate only slightly. Week-long deviations of 5.5 degrees over an area of 1.5 million square kilometers -- an area 35 times the size of Switzerland -- present an extraordinary change to the living conditions of marine organisms.For the seven marine heatwaves with the greatest impact, researchers at the University of Bern carried out what is referred to as attribution studies. Statistical analyses and climate simulations are used to assess the extent to which anthropogenic climate change is responsible for the occurrence of individual extremes in the weather conditions or the climate. Attribution studies typically demonstrate how the frequency of the extremes has changed through human influence.According to the findings of the attribution studies, major marine heatwaves have become more than 20 times more frequent due to human influence. While they occurred every hundred or thousand years in the pre-industrial age, depending on the progress of global warming, in the future they are set to become the norm. If we are able to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, heatwaves will occur once every decade or century. If temperatures rise by 3 degrees, however, extreme situations can be expected to occur in the world's oceans once per year or decade.

But until now, scientists have been unable to conclusively explain the reasons for this, because they were mostly focusing on atmospheric processes. Now, experts at the AWI have solved the puzzle: the alarming expansion of the tropics is not caused by processes in the atmosphere, but quite simply by warming subtropical ocean.","Forest fires in Australia and California, droughts and water shortages in the Mediterranean -- in the last few years, events such as these have become more frequent. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the tropics, the warm region surrounding the Equator, appear to be expanding. And that leads to the affected areas becoming hotter and drier. According to the official definition, the tropics extend across the Equator between the latitudes of 23 degrees North and 23 degrees South. The central area is humid, with a great deal of precipitation, while the marginal regions in the north and south are hot and dry. As a result of climate change, however, for some time now the dry regions have been expanding northwards in the Northern Hemisphere -- as far as Southern California -- and southwards in the Southern Hemisphere.But up to now, climate researchers have had a problem. They couldn't conclusively explain this obvious expansion of the tropics using their climate models. The models simply didn't show the magnitude and the regional characteristic of the observed expansion. A team working with the physicists Hu Yang and Gerrit Lohmann at the Alfred Wegner Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven (AWI) has now discovered the likely cause. As the AWI experts report in the ""Our simulations show that an enhanced warming over the subtropical ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are the main drivers,"" says Hu Yang, the study's lead author. These subtropical warming patterns are generated by the dynamic of subtropical ocean gyres, measuring several hundreds of kilometres in diameter, which rotate slowly. These currents are especially well-known in the Pacific, because the majority of floating marine litter is concentrated in them. ""Because the currents in the region bring together the surface warming water masses particularly intensely, it's easier for the subtropical ocean surface to accumulate warmth than in other regions -- and the same applies to plastic,"" says Lohmann. As a result of this warming of the subtropical ocean, the tropical warm ocean regions are expanding. According to his calculations, this phenomenon is the catalyst for the tropics expanding to the north and south. ""Previous researchers had been taking an overly complicated approach to the problem, and assumed it was due to complex changes in the atmosphere. In reality, it's due to a relatively simple mechanism involving ocean currents.""What led the experts to explore this avenue: data on ocean gyres that they happened to come across five years ago -- data on ocean temperatures and satellite-based data, freely available on databases. Both sources indicated that the gyres were becoming warmer and more powerful. ""That's what led us to believe that they might be a decisive factor in the expansion of the tropics,"" explains Hu Yang.The AWI experts were right: their findings perfectly correspond to actual observations and the latest field data on tropical expansion. Just like in reality, their climate model shows that the tropics are now stretching farther to the north and south alike. In the Southern Hemisphere, the effect is even more pronounced, because the ocean takes up more of the overall area there than in the Northern Hemisphere.Yet when it comes to the question of whether the droughts in Australia, California and the Mediterranean are due to the expansion of the tropics, Gerrit Lohmann can't give a definitive answer. ""When talking about climate change, it's always difficult to quantify the respective parameters with absolute certainty,"" he says. ""However, we can safely assume that the ocean currents and expansion of the tropics make droughts and hurricanes more likely to occur.""",Climate,2020.0,"The expansion of the tropics, which has led to more frequent forest fires, droughts and water shortages, is caused by an enhanced warming over the subtropical ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, according to a study by the Alfred Wegner Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven.

Mean temperature has increased by almost 1oC during the course of the study. Some tree species in Lopé National Park are dependent on a dip in temperature to trigger flowering but warmer temperatures may mean that this vital cue to producing fruit is being missed.Dr Emma Bush said: ""The massive collapse in fruiting among more than 70 tree species studied at Lopé National Park, Gabon may be due to species missing the environmental cue to bear fruit, because of increased temperatures and less rainfall. Less fruit in the ecosystem will have huge impacts on forest dynamics such as seed dispersal, plant reproduction and food availability for wildlife such as forest elephants, chimpanzees, and gorillas.""The University of Stirling is a pioneer in tropical ecology research, having established the Station d'Etudes des Gorilles et Chimpanzes (SEGC -- The Gorilla and Chimpanzee Research Station) with the Centre Internationale de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF, The International Medical Research Centre in Franceville) in Lopé National Park, central Gabon, in 1983.This 37-year, on-going collaboration between the University and the Government of Gabon has generated a unique data set that allows researchers to monitor how the rainforests and wildlife of the Congo Basin are responding to climate change.Dr Robin Whytock said: ""Large animals like forest elephants are already under severe pressure in Central Africa due to hunting, habitat loss and habitat degradation. If important protected areas like Lopé National Park in Gabon can no longer support them because there is not enough food, then we may see further population declines, jeopardising their survival in the long-term.""We know that large bodied animals, like elephants, are disproportionately important for the healthy functioning of ecosystems and their loss could result in broad changes to forest systems and even reduce the amount of carbon stored there.""Functioning tropical ecosystems are important for global climate regulation and global health.

During hurricane Irma, an extremely powerful Category 5 storm that hit the North Caribbean in 2017, NIOZ scientist Rebecca James witnessed how native seagrass meadows along the coast of Sint Maarten held their ground, reduced coastal erosion and lowered the chances of flooding. In the years of research during her PhD, she saw the pressures on this natural storm protection increasing. In her dissertation, The future of seagrass ecosystem services in a changing world, James warns that further loss of these green meadows will leave tropical islands vulnerable and will exacerbate the negative effects of climate change","The flexible grass, that grows in shallow bays and lagoons throughout the Caribbean, is a natural wave dampener. As it sways back and forth, it removes energy from the waves, keeps the sand on the seafloor stable and, thereby, protects the beach against erosion. James: 'It is a great natural protector of beaches and reduces the need for human intervention, such as sand nourishments and seawalls.'Seagrass offers more than protection to the islands and its people. The underwater meadows form a rich environment in which marine life, from micro-organisms to large animals, thrive. In turn, this benefits the local fishing communities. James: 'In science, we call these ecosystem services.' And seagrass serves many. James: 'Through photosynthesis, seagrass removes COThe biggest threats come from human disturbance, invasive species and bad water quality on the coasts. James: 'Tourists flock to the Caribbean for the beautiful beaches and clear waters. Resorts, restaurants and bars have been built throughout the Caribbean to support tourism, however, often at the expense of the natural environment.' Dunes had to make way for hotels, seagrass -and seaweed were removed to create perfectly groomed beaches, feet trample the meadows, and boat anchors leave scars; physical damage that takes years to recover.A healthy seagrass ecosystem depends on healthy neighbours. And the grasses suffer under the damage done to nearby coral reefs or inland mangroves. James: 'Coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass meadows are vital for a healthy Caribbean Bay. The systems are strongly connected and benefit each other.' Animals move between the corals and seagrass meadows depending on their need for food or protection from predators or waves. Mangroves filter sediment that runs from the land into the ocean, improving water quality and clarity. James: 'With more people comes more wastewater, which reduces the water quality when there isn't sufficient water treatment.' Over the years, more and more mangroves had to make way for farming and housing. With little left behind to capture the sediment, the water in the bays turns cloudy and dirty.As the pressure on seagrass increases from different directions, the importance of an integrated approach to protection, conservation and restoration becomes clear. James: 'My more recent research shows that overgrazing by turtles and an invasive seagrass species (Halophila stipulacea) that is currently spreading around the Caribbean, reduce the coastal protection services. This example shows the importance to match conservation efforts of turtles with conservation of their habitats.'To mitigate the negative effects of climate change and protect the biodiversity in our oceans, there is a great need for the natural self-sustaining strategies that seagrass meadows provide. However, James warns that in ecosystems it is not that simple to get back what was once lost. James: 'Only 37% of seagrass restorations have survived. Projects like these take time, money and support from local communities and stakeholders. Working in coastal areas, waves and storms can undo hours of intensive restoration labour.'James urges that we need to act fast to improve the health of seagrass ecosystems.

They found that these droughts, which form over the ocean and then migrate landward, can cause larger and drier conditions than droughts that occur solely over the land. Of all the droughts affecting land areas worldwide from 1981 to 2018, roughly one in six were landfalling droughts, according to the study published Sept. 21 in ""We normally don't think about droughts over the ocean -- it may even sound counterintuitive.

Historically, droughts have displaced millions of people and cost billions of dollars. Yet the climate processes that lead to drought are not fully understood, making accurate predictions difficult.In order to pinpoint the large-scale landfalling droughts that originated over the ocean, the researchers used an object tracking algorithm to identify and follow clusters of moisture deficits all over the world, going back decades in time. They found that the landfalling droughts grew about three times as fast as land-only droughts, and usually took several months to reach a continent.""Not all of the droughts that cause damage to humans and ecosystems are going to be these landfalling droughts,"" said study senior author and climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, the Kara J. Foundation Professor at Stanford Earth.

Species that rely most on finding a suitably shady location to keep cool are at the greatest risk of population decline. The results predict how climate change might impact butterfly communities, and will inform conservation strategies to protect them.","The results, published today in the More colourful larger species such as the Peacock (The study found that some butterfly species rely on finding a spot at a specific temperature within a landscape -- termed a 'microclimate' -- to control their body temperature. Air temperatures vary on a fine scale: a shaded patch of ground is cooler than one in full sun, for example.

The populations of two thirds of UK butterfly species are in decline: habitat loss and fragmentation, and more monotonous landscapes have removed many of the microclimates butterflies need to survive. Climate change is compounding the problem by causing more extreme weather events and greater fluctuations in temperature.Insects, including butterflies, pollinate around 85% of our food crops -- providing a vital service worth billions of pounds globally. Protecting a diverse range of species will provide long-term resilience: if numbers of one species fall there are others to fill the gaps. Insects are also an important food source for many other species, including birds.""Butterfly species that aren't very good at controlling their temperature with small behavioural changes, but rely on choosing a micro-habitat at the right temperature, are likely to suffer the most from climate change and habitat loss,"" said Dr Andrew Bladon, a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, and first author of the report.He added: ""We need to make landscapes more diverse to help conserve many of our butterfly species. Even within a garden lawn, patches of grass can be left to grow longer -- these areas will provide cooler, shady places for many species of butterfly. In nature reserves, some areas could be grazed or cut and others left standing. We also need to protect features that break up the monotony of farm landscapes, like hedgerows, ditches, and patches of woodland.""Landscapes with a diversity of heights and features have a greater range of temperatures than flat, monotonous ones. This applies on scales from kilometres to centimetres: from hillsides to flower patches. Such structural diversity creates different microclimates that many butterflies use to regulate their temperature.The research involved catching nearly 4,000 wild butterflies in hand-held nets, and taking the temperature of each using a fine probe. The surrounding air temperature was measured, and for butterflies found perching on a plant, the air temperature at the perch was also taken. This indicated the degree to which butterflies were seeking out specific locations to control their body temperature. In total, 29 different butterfly species were recorded.The study reveals that butterflies are either thermal generalists or thermal specialists, and this does not always correspond with their current categorisations as either habitat generalists or specialists.""As we plan conservation measures to address the effects of climate change, it will be important to understand not only the habitat requirements of different butterfly species, but also their temperature requirements,"" said Dr Ed Turner in the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge, who led the work.He added: ""With this new understanding of butterflies, we should be able to better manage habitats and landscapes to protect them, and in doing so we're probably also protecting other insects too.""Over the past thirty years, many species of butterfly have expanded their range northwards, as more northerly places have become warmer due to climate change. The ranges of species adapted to cooler environments are shrinking. These trends have been tracked for butterfly populations as a whole, but no previous study has investigated how the individual butterflies that make up these populations are able to respond to small scale temperature changes.Bladon said: ""I like to think of butterflies as the gateway drug. If we can get people involved in butterfly conservation, that's the first step to getting them to care about insects more broadly.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study from the University of Cambridge has found that some butterfly species rely on finding a specific temperature within a landscape, known as a 'microclimate', to regulate their body temperature.

New research from Portland State University found that while the increased wildfire activity is causing widespread changes in the structure and composition of these mid-to-high elevation forests, the new landscapes are also likely more resilient to projected upward trends in future fire activity and climate conditions.","The study, led by PSU graduate student Sebastian Busby, examined temperate forests that burned expansively, severely and repeatedly between 2003 and 2015 in the central Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington. On Mt. Adams, these wildfires included the 2008 Cold Springs, 2012 Cascade Creek and 2015 Cougar Creek fires. On Mt. Jefferson, the wildfires included the 2003 Booth and Bear Butte Complex, 2007 Warm Springs Area Lightning Complex and 2014 Bear Butte 2 fires. Some areas Busby studied have burned again this summer as part of the Lionshead fire in the Mt. Jefferson area.Busby said that historically, wet and cool climate limited fire events in these humid forest environments to an interval of 50 to 200-plus years. But climate change has led to warmer winters, reduced mountain snowpack and longer, drier summers and fire seasons. The time between repeated wildfire events in this study was less than 12 years.""These forests are drying out earlier in the year, making them more vulnerable to frequent, severe and larger wildfires,"" Busby said. ""Because these forests have not historically burned very often, they're composed of high densities of tree species that are not well-adapted to frequent and very large severe fires.""True firs were the dominant conifer tree species across the study areas, but post-fire tree regeneration was generally very poor due to a lack of live mature trees remaining after the fires to reseed the forest.The burned areas, however, did support the establishment of pines at a low density, which are functionally better adapted to fire. The findings suggest that in the near term, these forests may transition from a dense fir-dominated conifer forest into a patchy, low-density, pine-dominated forest that will likely lack the fuel connectivity conducive to crown fires. Busby said that while widespread forest composition change and forest cover loss may be alarming, the results indicate that the altered structure and composition are likely to be more resilient in the face of future fire and climate conditions, such as drought and heatwave events.""From an ecological point of view, these reburned forests are going to have a greater abundance of tree species that are better adapted to fire and potentially have less flammable forest structure overall,"" he said. ""Now, in these post-reburned forests that are growing in a warmer and drier world, it will be up to us to decide whether we let future fires burn or not.""If forest managers and other stakeholders choose to suppress them, they risk returning these forests to their historical dense structures, which thrived in cool and wet climates. However, under ongoing warming conditions, this alternative might increase the likelihood of severe and expansive fires in the future, negatively impacting human life, property, and natural resources.""Wildfires are a natural ecological process on these landscapes and have been for thousands of years,"" Busby said. ""Wildfire can be a great catalyst for change, but that change doesn't have to be entirely negative. We must learn to co-exist with wildfires, use them effectively, and embrace the positive elements they bring to our regional forests and ecosystems.""The findings are published in the journal ",Climate,2020.0,"A study led by a graduate student at Portland State University has found that climate change has led to more frequent, severe and larger wildfires in temperate forests in the central Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington.

Minerals within the rocks dissolved and washed with the carbon into the ocean, consuming enough carbon dioxide to cool the planet and allow for large ice sheets to form over North America and Northern Europe.""You have the continental crust of Australia bulldozing into these volcanic islands, giving you really high mountains just south of the equator,"" said Nicholas Swanson-Hysell, associate professor of earth and planetary science at UC Berkeley and senior author of the study. ""So, you have this big increase of land area that is quite steep, in a region where it's warm and wet and a lot of rock types that have the ability to naturally sequester carbon.""Starting about 15 million years ago, this tropical mountain-building drew down carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, decreasing the strength of the greenhouse effect and cooling the planet. By about 3 million years ago, Earth's temperature was cool enough to allow snow and ice to remain through the summer and grow into huge ice sheets over the Northern Hemisphere, like that covering Greenland today.Once Northern Hemisphere ice sheets grew, other climate dynamics led to a cycle of glacial maxima and minima every 40,000 to 100,000 years. At the most recent glacial maximum, about 15,000 years ago, massive ice sheets covered most of Canada, the northern portions of the U.S., as well as Scandinavia and much of the British Isles.""If it wasn't for the carbon sequestration that's happening in the Southeast Asian islands, we wouldn't have ended up with the climate that includes a Greenland ice sheet and these glacial and interglacial cycles,"" Swanson-Hysell said. ""We wouldn't have crossed this atmospheric COThe periodic growth and decline of the northern ice sheets -- the cycle of glacial maxima and minima -- is likely postponed, due to human emissions that have increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.""A process that took millions of years we have reversed in 100 years,"" Swanson-Hysell said. ""Over the next tens to hundreds of thousands of years, geological processes in places like Southeast Asia will once again decrease COUC Berkeley doctoral student Yuem Park, Swanson-Hysell and their colleagues, including Francis Macdonald of UC Santa Barbara and Yves Goddéris of Géosciences Environnement Toulouse, will publish their findings this week in the journal Geologists have long speculated about the processes that periodically warm and cool the planet, occasionally covering the entire globe with ice and turning it into a so-called snowball Earth.Once scientists realized that, over the course of millions of years, tectonic processes move land masses around the planet like massive jigsaw puzzle pieces, they sought a connection between continental movements -- and collisions -- and ice ages. Cycles of Earth's orbit are responsible for the 40,000- or 100,000-year fluctuations in temperature that overlay the long-term warming and cooling.The rise of the Himalayas in Asia in the mid-latitudes over the past 50 million years has been a prime candidate for cooling and the start of a glacial climate after an extended geologic interval without ice sheets. A few years ago, however, Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald saw a correlation between mountain-building in tropical areas and the onset of time intervals with ice ages over the past 500 million years.In 2017, they proposed that a major ice age 445 million years ago was triggered by mountain- building in the tropics, and they followed that in 2019 with a more complete correlation of the last four time intervals of glacial climate and collisions between continents and tropical island arcs. They argue that the combination of increased exposure of rock with minerals that can sequester carbon and a plenitude of warm tropical rain is particularly effective in pulling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.The process involves chemical dissolution of the rocks that consume carbon dioxide, which is then locked in carbonate minerals that form limestone rock in the ocean. The calcium within seashells that you find on the beach may have come out of a tropical mountain on the other side of the world, Swanson-Hysell said.""We built up a new database of these types of mountain-building events and then reconstructed the latitude at which they happened,"" Swanson-Hysell said. ""Then we saw, hey, there is a lot of cooling when there is a lot of this type of mountain being built in the tropics, which is the Southeast Asian setting. The Southeast Asian islands are the best analog for processes that we also see further in the past.""For the current paper, Park, Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald teamed up with Goddéris to model more precisely what carbon dioxide levels would be with changes in the size of the Southeast Asian islands.The researchers first recreated the sizes of the islands as they grew over the last 15 million years, focusing primarily on the largest: Java, Sumatra, the Philippines, Sulawesi and New Guinea. They calculated that the area of the islands increased from 0.3 million square kilometers 15 million years ago to 2 million square kilometers today. UC Santa Barbara graduate student Eliel Anttila, who was an undergraduate student in earth and planetary science at UC Berkeley and is a co-author of the paper, contributed to this aspect of the research.They then used Godderis' GEOCLIM computer model to estimate how the growth of these islands altered carbon levels in the atmosphere. Together with UC Berkeley postdoctoral scholar Pierre Maffre, who recently obtained his Ph.D. in Godderis' lab, they updated the model to account for the variable effect of different rock types. The model is linked with a climate model in order to relate COThey found that the increase of land area along the southeast edge of the Pacific corresponded with global cooling, as reconstructed from oxygen isotope compositions in ocean sediments. The carbon dioxide levels inferred from the model also match some measurement-based estimates, though Swanson-Hysell admits that estimating COBased on their model, chemical weathering in the Southeast Asian islands alone diminished COWhile the threshold for Arctic glaciation is estimated to be about 280 ppm of carbon dioxide, the threshold for ice sheet formation at the South Pole is much higher: about 750 ppm. That's why the Antarctic ice sheets began forming much earlier, about 34 million years ago, than those in the Arctic.While the researchers' model doesn't allow them to isolate the climatic effects of the rise of the Himalayas, their Southeast Asian island scenario alone can account for the appearance of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. They did explore the effect of volcanic events occurring around the same time, including massive lava flows, or flood basalts, such as those in Ethiopia and North America (Columbian traps). Though the weathering of such rocks has been proposed as an ice age trigger, the model shows that this activity played a minor role, compared to the rise of the Southeast Asian islands.""These results highlight that the Earth's climate state is particularly sensitive to changes in tropical geography,"" the authors conclude.Swanson-Hysell credits the campus's France-Berkeley Fund for providing resources for an initial collaboration with Goddéris that led to a large collaborative grant from the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Frontier Research in Earth Science program to further pursue the research resulting in this paper.The French-American team plans to model other past ice ages, including the one in the Ordovician period 445 million years ago that, in 2017, Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald proposed was triggered by a collision similar to that occurring today in the Southeast Asian islands. That collision took place during the first phase of Appalachian mountain-building, when the present-day eastern U.S. was located in the tropics.The research was supported by the France-Berkeley Fund and the NSF (1926001, 1925990).",Climate,2020.0,"New research by scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara and a research institute in Toulouse, France has suggested that the growth of Southeast Asian islands millions of years ago played a key role in cooling the planet enough to allow ice sheets to form over North America and Northern Europe.

Well-known species of carnivorous plants include the Venus fly trap and pitcher plants.Lead researcher, restoration ecologist Dr Adam Cross from the School of Molecular and Life Sciences at Curtin University, said the loss of carnivorous plants would not only be devastating due to their captivating qualities, but could potentially have detrimental effects across ecosystems.""Carnivorous plants are an iconic group of plants, and they are often involved in complex biological relationships with animals -- sometimes providing habitats for animals, or even relying upon animals to digest the prey they catch for them,"" Dr Cross said.""Our research has found around 25 per cent of the world's carnivorous plants are at increasing risk of extinction.

This cycle, and how it works in one of the driest places on Earth, is the subject of a new study recently published in the journal Plant and Soil with lead author and Arizona State University (ASU) scientist, Heather Throop.","While the natural carbon cycle should be balanced each year, with about as much carbon taken out of the atmosphere as is released back by natural processes, humans are upsetting this balance through carbon dioxide additions to the atmosphere, both through changing land use that releases carbon stored in soils and from burning fossil fuels.In an effort to understand what controls the release of carbon dioxide from soils in deserts, Throop and a team of university students from Namibia conducted field work in the Namib Desert, one of the world's driest regions that stretches more than 1,200 miles along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa.What Throop and her team ultimately determined from their research is that subtle differences in surface topography and erosion have big influences on microorganisms in the soil and these differences ultimately affect carbon cycling. Even in the driest places, they found signs of life influencing carbon cycling.""The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere affects our climate, so understanding what affects the release of carbon from soils is important predicting how climate will change in the future."" says Throop, who is an associate professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Life Sciences.To conduct their analyses, the research team chose six locations that differed in yearly rainfall. At each site they carried out 48-hour sampling campaigns, working continuously day and night to collect data. At each location, the team analyzed the landscape structure and plants and selected representative locations to sample. Then, they simulated rainfall and used gas analyzers to measure carbon dioxide release from soils, to determine how carbon cycling responded as soils dried after the simulated rain.""It's really an incredible amount of data to collect manually,"" says Throop. ""And having a crew of dedicated and enthusiastic students made this work possible. Often for remote field work like this we just get a snapshot of what is happening at one or two sites or at a few points in time.

Bush uses fossil pollen and charcoal recovered from lake sediments dating back thousands of years to track changes in vegetation and fire frequency through time. He has found that fires were almost unknown in Amazonia before the arrival of humans.Relatively small-scale disturbances caused by the first inhabitants of Amazonia over the last 10,000 years did not bring the system to a tipping point because it could recover from these minor events. But the modern effects of a warming climate and elevated drought risk -- both the product of anthropogenic climate change -- are combining with much larger-scale deforestation and burning in Amazonia to create the conditions where vast areas of rainforest could transition to savanna in a matter of decades.""The immense biodiversity of the rainforest is at risk from fire,"" Bush said.One of the key points of the paper, ""New and repeating tipping points: the interplay of fire, climate change and deforestation in Neotropical ecosystems,"" is that while no individual government can control climate change, fire can be regulated through policy. Almost all fires in Amazonia are set deliberately by people and have become much more frequent in the last two years, because of altered policy, than over the previous decade.Bush's data show that the tipping point is likely to be reached if temperatures rise by another 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit.

She and colleagues report that their modeling with the added ice melt information reveals interacting processes.For this work, Sadai's task was to add accelerated AIS melting and icebergs into simulations of Earth's future climate. One important step was to include the details of where and when the meltwater will go into the ocean.She says, ""We found that future melt water coming off Antarctica leads to huge amounts of thick sea ice around the continent. With higher greenhouse gas emissions, the ice sheet melts faster, which in turn leads to more freshwater flowing into the ocean and more sea ice production.""All this additional meltwater and sea ice production dramatically slows the pace of future warming around Antarctica, the researchers report -- seemingly welcome news. And remarkably, the climate impacts are not just restricted to the Antarctic. Condron, previously at UMass Amherst, points out that the cooling effects are felt worldwide.But ,he adds, ""All that said, it's important to note that this is not a global 'cooling' scenario -- average global temperatures would still be roughly 3 degrees Celsius warmer than today due to human greenhouse gas emissions, even with the cooling effects of this melt water on climate.""That is not the end of the story. Even though atmospheric warming slows, the deep sea waters around Antarctica actually warm faster in their model. This is because, Condron explains, the new sea ice stops heat from escaping from the deeper waters to the atmosphere. ""The subsurface ocean waters warm by as much as one degree Celsius, which can increase melting below parts of the ice sheet. This could make the ice sheet more unstable and accelerate rates of sea level rise beyond current projections.""Overall, Sadai says, ""Our results demonstrate a need to accurately account for meltwater input from ice sheets if we are to make confident climate predictions."" She emphasizes that the delayed future warming they found in the new simulations may sound like good news, but it is important to keep in mind that serious warming and sea level rise will still occur with unabated greenhouse gas emissions, which will affect coastal communities and ecosystems worldwide.DeConto and Pollard add that the future stability of the AIS and future sea-level rise will be governed by which process wins out -- ocean warming or atmospheric cooling.

Consequences for the world's coastal cities and cultural heritage sites would be detrimental, from London to Mumbai, and from New York to Shanghai. That's what a team of researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Potsdam University and New York's Columbia University has found out in their new study, published in ","""Antarctica holds more than half of Earth's fresh water, frozen in a vast ice-sheet which is nearly 5 kilometers thick,"" explains Ricarda Winkelmann, researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and University of Potsdam, and corresponding author of the study. ""As the surrounding ocean water and atmosphere warm due to human greenhouse-gas emissions, the white cap on the South Pole loses mass and eventually becomes unstable. Because of its sheer magnitude, Antarctica's potential for sea-level contribution is enormous: We find that already at 2 degrees of warming, melting and the accelerated ice flow into the ocean will, eventually, entail 2.5 meters of global sea level rise just from Antarctica alone. At 4 degrees, it will be 6.5 meters and at 6 degrees almost 12 meters if these temperature levels would be sustained long enough.""The paper's title refers to the complex physical phenomenon of hysteresis. In this case, that translates into irreversibility. Anders Levermann, co-author and researcher at PIK and Columbia University describes: ""Antarctica is basically our ultimate heritage from an earlier time in Earth's history. It's been around for roughly 34 million years. Now our simulations show that once it's melted, it does not regrow to its initial state even if temperatures eventually sank again. Indeed, temperatures would have to go back to pre-industrial levels to allow its full recovery -- a highly unlikely scenario. In other words: What we lose of Antarctica now, is lost forever.""The reasons behind this irreversibility are self-enforcing mechanisms in the ice sheets' behavior under warming conditions. Co-author Torsten Albrecht lays out: ""In West Antarctica for instance, the main driver of ice loss is warm ocean water leading to higher melting underneath the ice shelves, which in turn can destabilize the grounded ice sheet. That makes glaciers the size of Florida slide into the ocean. Once temperatures cross the threshold of six degrees above pre-industrial levels, effects from the ice surface become more dominant: As the gigantic mountains of ice slowly sink to lower heights where the air is warmer, this leads to more melt at the ice surface -- just as we observe in Greenland.""Ice loss and melting have accelerated significantly over the last decades in Antarctica. The authors however have explicitly not addressed the question of time scale in their work, but rather assess the critical warming levels at which parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet become unstable. Winkelmann explains this approach: ""In the end, it is our burning of coal and oil that determines ongoing and future greenhouse-gas emissions and therefore, if and when critical temperature thresholds in Antarctica are crossed. And even if the ice loss happens on long time scales, the respective carbon dioxide levels can already be reached in the near future. We decide now whether we manage to halt the warming. So Antarctica's fate really lies in our hands -- and with it that of our cities and cultural sites across the globe, from Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana to Sydney's Opera House. Thus, this study really is another exclamation mark behind the importance of the Paris Climate Accord: Keep global warming below two degrees.""Levermann adds: ""If we give up the Paris Agreement, we give up Hamburg, Tokyo and New York.""",Climate,2020.0,"A study from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research warns that Antarctica's melting ice could contribute to a global sea-level rise of 2.5 meters at 2 degrees Celsius of warming, 6.5 meters at 4 degrees, and almost 12 meters at 6 degrees.

The roughly 300 to 350 bears in Kane Basin, a frigid channel between Canada's Ellesmere Island and Greenland, make up about 1-2% of the world's polar bears.","New research shows that Kane Basin polar bears are doing better, on average, in recent years than they were in the 1990s. The study, published Sept. 23 in ""We find that a small number of the world's polar bears that live in multiyear ice regions are temporarily benefiting from climate change,"" said lead author Kristin Laidre, a polar scientist at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory's Polar Science Center.If greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere and the climate keeps warming, within decades these polar bears will likely face the same fate as their southern neighbors already suffering from declining sea ice.""The duration of these benefits is unknown. Under unmitigated climate change, we expect the Kane Basin bears to run into the same situation as polar bears in the south -- it's just going to happen later,"" Laidre said. ""They'll be one of the last subpopulations that will be negatively affected by climate change.""All of the world's 19 polar bear subpopulations, including Kane Basin, are experiencing a shorter on-ice hunting season, according to a 2016 study led by Laidre. This makes it hard for the animals, that can weigh more than 1,200 pounds as adults, to meet their nutritional needs. Polar bears venture out on sea ice to catch seals. In summer when the sea ice melts, the polar bears fast on land.Laidre led a recent study showing that in the Baffin Bay polar bear subpopulation, which includes about 2,800 bears living just south of Kane Basin, adult females are thinner and are having fewer cubs as the summer open-water season -- when they must fast on land -- grows longer.""Kane Basin is losing its multiyear ice, too, but that doesn't have the same effect on the polar bears' ability to hunt,"" Laidre said. ""Multiyear ice becomes annual ice, whereas annual ice becomes open water, which is not good for polar bears.""The new paper looked at Kane Basin bears using satellite tracking data and direct physical measurements to compare from 1993 to 1997 with a more recent period, from 2012 to 2016. The body condition, or fatness, improved for all ages of males and females. The average number of cubs per litter, another measure of the animals' overall health, was unchanged.Satellite tags showed the Kane Basin polar bears traveled across larger areas in recent years, covering twice as much distance and ranging farther from their home territory.""They now have to move over larger areas,"" Laidre said. ""The region is transitioning into this annual sea ice that is more productive but also more dynamic and broken up.""Observations show a profound shift in the sea ice in Kane Basin between the two study periods. In the 1990s, about half the area was covered in multiyear ice in the peak of summer, while in the 2010s the region was almost completely annual ice, which melts to open water in summer.Even though there's now more open water, the marine ecosystem has become more productive. Annual sea ice allows more sunlight through, so more algae grow, which supports more fish and in turn attracts seals.""Two decades ago, scientists hypothesized that climate change could temporarily benefit polar bears in multiyear ice regions over the short term, and our observations support that,"" Laidre said.The subpopulation on the other side of Ellesmere Island, in Canada's Norwegian Bay, could be in a similar situation, she said, though no data exist for those animals.If conditions continue to warm these northernmost polar bears will likely face the same fate as their southern neighbors. Kane Basin polar bears have only much deeper water to turn to farther north.""It's important not to jump to conclusions and suggest that the High Arctic, which historically was covered by multiyear sea ice, is going to turn into a haven for polar bears,"" said Laidre, who is also an associate professor in the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. ""The Arctic Ocean around the North Pole is basically an abyss, with very deep waters that will never be as productive as the shallower waters to the south where most polar bears live.""So we are talking about temporary benefits in a limited area and to a very small number of bears.""",Climate,2020.0,"New research shows that polar bears in the Kane Basin region are doing better than they were in the 1990s, due to climate change.

The underlying mechanisms are still little known, especially in mammals. An international team of scientists led by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW) has now demonstrated that in the common noctule bat, one of the largest European bat species, the colonization of hibernacula progresses from lower to higher latitudes over successive generations of young animals -- especially first-year males. Because of their relatively high reproduction rate and the long-distance dispersal of male juveniles, it is probably relatively easy for common noctules to adjust to global warming. For species with lower reproduction rates and a limited migratory potential of the young -- the majority of European bat species -- the future might not look as favourable when facing continuing global warming. The paper was published in the scientific journal ","The rapid pace of global warming is forcing animals to adjust their lives to ensure their survival and successful reproduction. Highly mobile species such as migratory bats could potentially shift their summer and wintering habitats to higher or lower latitudes according to how the regional climate is changing. This flexibility could enable migratory bats to stay within ideal conditions for reproducing and rearing of young or for hibernation. For example, in recent years common noctule bats have shifted their wintering area further north. Is this shift in the wintering range the consequence of adult bats moving further north for hibernation year after year, or are these shifts done by juvenile bats from successive generations? Scientists of the Leibniz-IZW and partners from the Ukraine -- the ""Bat Rehabilitation Center of Feldman Ecopark"" and the ""Ukrainian Independent Ecology Institute"" -- addressed this question in a long-term study.""We showed that the northwards move of the hibernation area of the common noctule occurs over several generations of juveniles,"" says Christian Voigt, head of the Department of Evolutionary Ecology at Leibniz-IZW. ""Especially young males, which usually migrate further from their birthplace than young females, are leading the way when colonising new hibernacula."" Since common noctules have a short life span, a high reproduction rate and can disperse over long distances, they may be able to adjust relatively quickly to global warming, even if the wintering area only successively changes from generation to generation.The investigation was carried out in the city of Kharkiv in northern Ukraine. Maternity colonies of common noctule females were long recorded north of the Kharkiv area, with hibernating animals moving to areas well south of Kharkiv. Then, 30 years ago the first individuals were encountered who hibernated further north close to Kharkiv, with increasing numbers of hibernating bats nearby since then. Over a ten-year period, the scientists collected data on the age and sex of almost 3,400 individuals. These data showed that young males dominated the early phase of colonisation of the new hibernation area. Gradually, the ratio of males to females and of young to adult animals became more balanced. ""We also investigated the region of origin of the hibernating common noctules by analysing stable hydrogen isotopes in the fur keratin,"" says Kseniia Kravchenko from Leibniz-IZW, the first author of the paper. ""The data of nearly 400 animals revealed that the number of long-distance migrants decreased in both females and males across all age groups."" This showed that in the early years of colonisation the hibernation population originated from summer quarters in the far north. More recently, the ""local"" population with summer quarters nearby, who previously had flown further south for hibernation, increasingly used the same area as their summer quarters for reproduction and for wintering.The rapid generational shift and the high dispersal capacity of young males seem to be an evolutionary advantage of common noctule bats in times of climate change, the authors conclude. ""Mammal species with higher life expectancies, lower reproductive rate and lower dispersal capacity may have a much harder time in keeping up with the pace of global warming,"" suspect Kravchenko and Voigt. ""If the distribution areas of these species only shift from generation to generation, the pace may be too slow and there is a chance that they will become extinct if global warming continues at the current high pace."" Further research will be necessary to understand these mechanisms of spatial adjustment to climate change in other mammalian species.",Climate,2020.0,"Migratory bats may be able to adjust to the effects of global warming by shifting their summer and wintering habitats to higher or lower latitudes, according to a study by scientists at Leibniz-IZW and partners from the Ukraine.

Using satellite images to track global tundra ecosystems over decades, a new study found the region has become greener, as warmer air and soil temperatures lead to increased plant growth.","""The Arctic tundra is one of the coldest biomes on Earth, and it's also one of the most rapidly warming,"" said Logan Berner, a global change ecologist with Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, who led the recent research. ""This Arctic greening we see is really a bellwether of global climatic change -- it's a biome-scale response to rising air temperatures.""The study, published this week in When the tundra vegetation changes, it impacts not only the wildlife that depend on certain plants, but also the people who live in the region and depend on local ecosystems for food. While active plants will absorb more carbon from the atmosphere, the warming temperatures could also be thawing permafrost, thereby releasing greenhouse gasses. The research is part of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), which aims to better understand how ecosystems are responding in these warming environments and the broader social implications.Berner and his colleagues used the Landsat data and additional calculations to estimate the peak greenness for a given year for each of 50,000 randomly selected sites across the tundra. Between 1985 and 2016, about 38% of the tundra sites across Alaska, Canada, and western Eurasia showed greening. Only 3% showed the opposite browning effect, which would mean fewer actively growing plants. To include eastern Eurasian sites, they compared data starting in 2000, when Landsat satellites began regularly collecting images of that region. With this global view, 22% of sites greened between 2000 and 2016, while 4% browned.""Whether it's since 1985 or 2000, we see this greening of the Arctic evident in the Landsat record,"" Berner said.

In that case, we can more accurately predict the virus concentration and better determine its viability or the potential for virus survival,"" said Dimitris Drikakis, one of the authors.Despite the importance of airborne droplet transmission, research regarding heat and mass transfer around and within respiratory droplets containing the virus has been scarce.To address the challenge, the researchers developed theoretical correlations for the unsteady evaporation of coronavirus-contaminated saliva droplets.

Dry forest margins may be more resilient to climate change than previously thought if managed appropriately, according to Penn State researchers.","""The basic narrative is it's just a matter of time before we lose these dry, low elevation forests,"" said Lucas Harris, a postdoctoral scholar who worked on the project as part of his doctoral dissertation. ""There's increasing evidence that once disturbances like drought or wildfire remove the canopy and shrub cover in these dry forests, the trees have trouble coming back. On the other hand, there's growing evidence that there's a lot of spatial variability in how resilient these forests are to disturbances and climate change.""The researchers studied forest regeneration at four sites that had experienced wildfires in the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. The sites sit at the forest margin, a drier area where forest meets sagebrush grassland. These dry forest margins may be the most vulnerable to climate change-driven forest loss, according to the researchers.Large fires in the area tend to consume the forest starting from the steppe margin then sweeping up the mountain, said Alan Taylor, professor of geography and ecology who has worked in the area for decades.""You wouldn't see forest anymore over 10 or 20 years, and it seemed like the lower forest margin was getting pushed way up in elevation because it's so dry near the sagebrush boundary,"" Taylor said. ""My research group wanted to look at this in detail because no one had actually done it.""Harris and Taylor's research team measured tree diameters and litter depth, counted the number of seedlings and saplings and identified tree species at the research sites. They also quantified fire severity, the amount of moisture available for plant growth and water deficit, an indicator of drought intensity. They then fed the data into five models to see how the probability for tree regeneration varied based on fire severity, climate and location, and remaining vegetation and canopy cover. They report their results today (Sept. 21) in The researchers found that 50% of the plots at the sites showed signs of tree regeneration, and water balance projections through the end of the current century indicate that there will be enough moisture available to support tree seedlings. The key is to prevent severe fire disturbances through proper management, according to the researchers, because tree regeneration was strongly associated with mature trees that survived fires.""In these marginal or dry forest areas, management approaches like prescribed burning or fuel treatments that thin the forest can prevent the severe fires that would push this ecosystem to a non-forest condition,"" said Taylor, who also holds an appointment in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. ""The study suggests that these low-severity disturbances could actually create very resilient conditions in places where most people have been suggesting that we'll see forest loss.""The researchers also noticed a shift in tree composition from fire-resistant yellow pines to less fire-resistant but more drought-resistant species like pinyon pine. They attributed the shift to drying and fire exclusion policies in effect over the last century.""The shift could be beneficial if the species moving in is better suited to present and near-future climates,"" said Harris. ""However, it could be dangerous if a bunch of fire-sensitive species move into a place and then it all burns up. Many trees would die, and we could see lasting forest loss.""California's climate is projected to warm, but many climate models also forecast an average increase in winter precipitation, especially in the northern part of the state and in the mountains, continued Harris.""On the one hand, you have greater drought intensity for sure, but also you're going to have these wetter periods where there's more moisture available for tree growth in the spring and maybe into the early summer,"" he said. ""So if the trees are able to survive that drought stress and take advantage of the additional moisture present in some years, they might be able to maintain or even expand their distribution.""This forest system is important for recreation, carbon storage, biodiversity and wildlife habitat, said Taylor. It also comprises part of the western side of the Great Basin, the largest area of contiguous watersheds that do not empty into an ocean in North America.""There's not much forest in the Great Basin, which is a huge area of sagebrush grassland in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona,"" Taylor said.

They show how human activities and climate change influence the available quantities of water. Knowledge of these units is fundamental to sustainable water management. However, due to underground connections, some catchment areas accumulate water from areas beyond their topographic boundaries, while others are effectively much smaller than their surface topography would suggest. Currently, most hydrological modelling strategies do not take these groundwater connections into account, but assume that the catchments are independent of their surroundings. For this reason, Dr. Yan Liu and Assistant Professor Dr. Andreas Hartmann from the Chair of Hydrological Modeling and Water Resources at the University of Freiburg, together with a team of researchers from the University of Bristol in England and Princeton University in the US, have introduced the Effective Catchment Index (ECI). Using this new metric, they were able to determine how topographic and actual catchment areas differ when analyzing a global data set. The team recently published the results in the journal ","Using the ECI, the team led by Liu and Hartmann was able to demonstrate that the assumption of a closed water balance, i.e. that the level of a river changes only through precipitation and evaporation from its topographic area, for example, does not apply to a considerable number of catchments around the world. Every third catchment studied has an effective catchment area that is even greater than twice or less than half its topographical area. The scientists recognized that these areas influence or are influenced outside their topographical boundaries by water management activities such as pumping groundwater and, for example, deforestation or reforestation.With their analysis, the researchers show that the ECI they have redefined is suitable for investigating how drought can spread across topographical boundaries as a result of water exchange. It can also be used in the analysis of the effects of climate and land use changes on cross-boundary water exchange.

Chlorophyll is a predictor of the amount of vegetation and algae in lakes, known as primary production, including invasive species such as milfoil.""Human activity, climate warming, agricultural, urban runoff and phosphorus from land use can all increase the level of chlorophyll in lakes. The primary production is most represented by the amount of chlorophyll in the lake, which has a cascading impact on the phytoplankton that eat the algae and the fish that eat the phytoplankton and the fish that eat those fish,"" says Filazzola. ""If the chlorophyll is too low, it can have cascading negative effects on the entire ecosystem, while too much can cause an abundance of algae growth, which is not always good.""Warming summer temperatures and increased solar radiation from decreased cloud cover in the northern hemisphere also contributes to an increase in chlorophyll, while more storm events caused by climate change contribute to degraded water quality, says Sharma. ""Agricultural areas and urban watersheds are more associated with degraded water quality conditions because of the amount of nutrients input into these lakes.""The researchers also gathered data on phosphorus and nitrogen levels -- often a predictor of chlorophyll -- as well as lake characteristics, land use variables, and climate data for each lake.

Beach migration, also known as shoreline retreat, causes coastal erosion of private and public beachfront property. Shoreline hardening, the construction of seawalls or revetments, interrupts natural beach migration -- causing waves to erode the sand, accelerating coastal erosion on neighboring properties, and dooming a beach to drown in place as the ocean continues to rise.The team of scientists, led by graduate researcher in the SOEST Department of Earth Sciences Kammie Tavares, assessed the shoreline around O?ahu that would be most vulnerable to erosion under three scenarios of sea level rise -- all estimated to occur before, and shortly after mid-century.They identified the location and severity of risk of shoreline hardening and beach loss, and a potential timeline for the increase in erosion hazards. The most threatened properties fall into an ""administrative erosion hazard zone,"" an area likely to experience erosion hazards and qualify for the emergency permitting process to harden the shoreline.""By assessing computer models of the beach migration caused by 9.8 inches (0.25 meters) of sea level rise, an amount with a high probability of occurring before mid-century, we found that emergency permit applications for shoreline hardening to protect beachfront property will substantially increase,"" said Tavares.According to co-author Dr. Tiffany Anderson, Assistant Researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences, ""We determined that almost 30 percent of all present-day sandy shoreline on O'ahu is already hardened, with another 3.5 percent found to be so threatened that those areas qualify for an emergency permit today. Our modeling indicates that, as sea level rises about 10 inches (0.25 meters) by mid-century, an additional nearly eight percent of sandy shoreline will be at risk of hardening -- meaning at that point, nearly 40% of Oahu's sandy beaches could be lost in favor of hardened shorelines.""""In another study published in 2018, we showed that accelerated erosion on neighboring properties, called flanking, usually leads to additional shoreline hardening, and condemnes entire beaches,"" said co-author Dr. Chip Fletcher, Associate Dean and Professor in SOEST. ""It is clear that management decisions made today, and during the careers of most of today's natural resource managers, will be critical in determining if future generations will inherent a healthy shoreline, or one that has been ruined by seawalls, and other types of shoreline hardening.""Coastal erosion is inevitable when sea level is rising and global mean sea level has been rising for decades and is accelerating. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected continued sea level rise for many centuries, even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced or stopped altogether. However, economists are projecting that greenhouse gas emissions will likely continue into mid-century and we will see more years like 2019 when the use of fossil fuels rose faster than the use of renewable forms of energy.""Despite these facts, we continue to see shoreline hardening as the preferred policy choice, largely because management agencies have failed to develop assisted transition plans for beachfront landowners who are caught in a tightening vice because of accelerating sea level rise,"" said Fletcher. ""In fact, directly to the contrary, beachfront lands continue to be sold to unwitting buyers with no appreciation for the expensive and frustrating situation they are entering into.""""Because coastal zone management laws continue to allow hardship variances in this era of rising sea level, despite widespread knowledge that seawalls kill beaches under these conditions, the same legal system designed to protect public trust lands, is responsible for destroying them,"" according to Fletcher. ""Government agencies must develop creative and socially equitable programs to rescue beachfront owners and free the sandy ecosystem so that it can migrate landward as it must in an era of rising seas. It is urgent that options are developed soon for beachfront landowners and resource managers to avoid further destructive management decisions.""""Beaches are critical ecosystems to native plants and animals, offer protection from storms, are an essential cultural setting, and attract tourists, who are important for Hawai'i's current economy,"" added Tavares.

The 2020 minimum extent was 958,000 square miles (2.48 million square kilometers) below the 1981-2010 average of yearly minimum extents, and 2020 is only the second time on record that the minimum extent has fallen below 1.5 million square miles (4 million square kilometers).""It was just really warm in the Arctic this year, and the melt seasons have been starting earlier and earlier,"" said Nathan Kurtz, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""The earlier the melt season starts, the more ice you generally lose.""Thin ice also melts quicker than thicker floes. Dramatic drops in sea ice extent in 2007 and 2012, along with generally declining summer extent, has led to fewer regions of thick, multi-year ice that has built up over multiple winters. In addition, a recent study showed that warmer water from the Atlantic Ocean, which is typically deep below the colder Arctic waters, is creeping up closer to the bottom of the sea ice and warming it from below.There are cascading effects in the Arctic, said Mark Serreze, director of NSIDC. Warmer ocean temperatures eat away at the thicker multiyear ice, and also result in thinner ice to start the spring melt season. Melt early in the season results in more open water, which absorbs heat from the Sun and increases water temperatures.""As the sea ice cover extent declines, what we're seeing is we're continuing to lose that multiyear ice,"" Serreze said. ""The ice is shrinking in the summer, but it's also getting thinner. You're losing extent, and you're losing the thick ice as well. It's a double whammy.""The second-lowest extent of sea ice on record is just one of many signs of a warming climate in the north, he said, pointing to the Siberian heat waves, forest fires, hotter-than-average temperatures over the Central Arctic, and the thawing permafrost that led to a Russian fuel spill.",Climate,2020.0,"Arctic sea ice has reached its second-lowest extent on record due to a Siberian heat wave that began the melt season early.

Now, as wildfires ravage the west and hurricanes batter the Atlantic and Gulf coasts with greater intensity, a new study involving Washington University in St. Louis researchers finds consumers across the United States and in some European countries are ready to start paying for it now.","One reason why governments have been slow to react is because of the cost-participation dilemma. In order to be effective, a climate policy must raise the price of carbon and include most countries in the world, explained Michael Bechtel, associate professor of political science in Arts & Sciences. But that's a challenge because participation is voluntary, and raising energy costs -- no matter how necessary -- is never popular.As policymakers debate the best way to fund climate action, Bechtel -- along with Kenneth Scheve at Yale University and Elisabeth van Lieshout at Stanford University -- wanted to better understand the public's perspective.In a study published Sept. 21 in Policymakers and pundits have generally assumed that ramping up climate action and costs over time would be the most attractive approach as it would allow consumers to prepare and adjust their energy usage. Instead, they found the majority in all four countries preferred a simpler, constant-cost plan -- even if average household costs are high.Policymakers take note: The constant-cost plan also significantly reduced opposition to climate action, as compared with the ramp-up plan.According to Bechtel, understanding the public's preference for funding climate action is important because these costs would likely be passed on to the consumer.""Carbon taxes are meant to change energy-intense production as well as consumption patterns, and they would be paid by businesses and consumers,"" Bechtel said. ""An example is a fuel tax that would directly increase the price of gasoline. A second type of a carbon tax is an emissions tax, which would raise the price of industrial activities that emit greenhouse gases. But even with this type of activity, consumers will ultimately incur higher prices because the increased production costs will require raising the price of such emission-intense goods.""Researchers began by introducing the notion of an international agreement, which would entail certain average costs per month and household. Respondents were given the four different options of distributing the costs of implementing the agreement over time and asked to indicate which cost schedule they would select in a referendum given a certain cost level average -- low or high.Across the four countries, 58% of respondents preferred the constant-cost plan, whereas only 12% preferred an increasing-cost plan.Those who favored the constant-cost plan stressed the desire to simplify budgeting and plan for the future. It also encouraged people to reduce their energy usage over time. Even when average household costs were substantial -- adding up to 2% of GDP -- most respondents still preferred the certainty of the constant plan.In comparison, those who preferred the ramp-up approach said this plan allowed people to gradually adjust to rising costs. Respondents also chose this option in the hope that delayed costs would leave less of a consumer impact because of wage increases, inflation, etc.Respondents who preferred higher costs up front emphasized the need to make investments now, which they said were essential to tackling climate change.""Credible climate policies will have to raise the price of carbon, and the public are concerned about these costs even when they believe the science of climate change and generally want governments to address the issue,"" the researchers wrote.""As policymakers seek to design policies that are transparent and meet meaningful emission reduction goals, our research indicates that constant-cost plans promise more support for climate action relative to ramping-up approaches.""Moreover, due to the delay in large-scale policy responses to climate change, countries will likely have to pursue more progressive and costly climate action to limit the adverse effects of global warming. The drop in support due to higher costs associated with these more ambitious policy efforts may be at least partially mitigated by selecting a set of attractive design features such as the constant distribution of costs.""Progress appears challenging, but it is possible. The 2016 Paris Agreement created a global framework to address climate change with countries committing to work together to limit the global average temperature increase to 2°C or less. But it stopped short of prescribing which policy instruments countries could use to reach the collective goal.""Countries have agreed that domestic mitigation measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions are needed,"" Bechtel said. ""This is the goal of carbon pricing: Incentivizing societies to produce less GHG emissions. There are several policy instruments that promise to get us closer to this goal. A carbon tax is one of these instruments, but countries can also use emission trading systems or emission reduction funds, for example. They could also rely on a combination of these policies.""",Climate,2020.0,"Governments have been slow to react to climate change due to the cost-participation dilemma.

In the ocean, extreme warming conditions are also becoming more frequent and intense. Two new studies from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) investigate marine heatwaves and currents at the edge of the continental shelf, which impact regional ocean circulation and marine life.","In a paper published September 17 in the ""This area is a hotspot for increasing temperature and extreme events, with drastic impacts on regional marine species,"" said lead author Svenja Ryan. ""It's important to understand where in the water column temperature and salinity changes are happening so you can determine how the ecosystem will be impacted.""For the first time in the Southern Indian Ocean, Ryan and her co-authors, WHOI physical oceanographers Caroline Ummenhofer and Glen Gawarkiewicz, showed that the effects of marine heatwaves extend to 300 meters or more below the surface along the entire west coast of Australia. They found that during La Niña years, the southward-flowing Leeuwin Current becomes stronger and is associated with warm temperature anomalies at greater depths. These conditions were observed during the 2011 marine heatwave that led to the first-recorded coral bleaching at Ningaloo Reef, a World Heritage site, and extensive loss of a nearby kelp forest. During El Niño periods, the temperature and salinity anomalies associated with marine heatwaves are limited to the ocean surface, showing that complex ocean processes play an important role in the depth-extent of extreme events.Ryan and her colleagues are using a similar modeling approach to study marine heatwaves in the Northwest Atlantic. ""The challenge, wherever you go, is that marine heatwaves have so many drivers,"" Ryan said. ""Understanding different types of events and their associated depth structure is crucial for regional impact assessment and adaptation strategies, as well as for predicting potential changes in a future climate.""While models allow scientists to understand and predict changes to large-scale ocean processes, these models rely on data collected in the field. In a study published Aug. 30, 2020, in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, lead author Jacob Forsyth made use of 25 years of oceanographic data collected by the container ship (CMV) Oleander on its weekly voyages between New Jersey and Bermuda. These measurements provide valuable insight into the Mid-Atlantic Bight Shelfbreak Jet, a cool-water current that flows south along the continental shelf from Labrador to Cape Hatteras.Forsyth, a graduate student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program and his co-authors, Gawarkiewicz and WHOI physical oceanographer Magdalena Andres, noticed a distinct relationship between the current and changing sea temperatures. Not only does the Shelfbreak Jet change seasonally -- slowing down considerably from winter to summer -- they also found it had slowed by about 10 percent since data collection began in 1992. The slow-down of the jet is consistent with the long-term warming of the continental shelf.""The Shelfbreak Jet is associated with the upwelling of nutrients, which affects the productivity of fisheries,"" said Gawarkiewicz. ""As marine heatwaves become more frequent, we need to understand how that links to the jet.""Starting in 2000, researchers began to notice that eddies of warm, salty water breaking off the Gulf Stream -- known as ""warm core rings"" -- had nearly doubled in number off the New England Continental Shelf. Not only do these rings cause water temperature and salinity to increase, they push the Shelfbreak Jet towards shore, and sometimes entirely shut down or reverse the direction of its flow. The authors noted that shifting currents and temperatures on the continental shelf have already prompted changes in key New England fisheries: cold-loving lobster are slowly moving offshore, while shortfin squid are more commonly found closer to shore.""You could call it a 'calamari comeback', where some of these rings are coming onto the continental shelf packed with squid. Others have none,"" said Gawarkiewicz. ""Jacob's work is an important step in unraveling this mystery and helping us predict how currents and shelf temperatures will respond to approaching rings.""The oceanographic data collected by the CMV Oleander are essential for understanding rapidly shifting dynamics in a complex system, said the co-authors. Previous studies rely on satellite data, which are limited to measurements of the ocean surface over a wide area. ""Looking at the surface might not tell the whole story of what's happening when rings approach the continental shelf, or their effects on upwelling,"" said Forsyth.

As erratic as they are, volcanic eruptions improve the predictability, an Indian-German research team finds. What seems to be a paradox is in fact due to a stronger coupling between the monsoon over large parts of South and South-East Asia and the El Niño phenomenon after an eruption. Combining data from meteorological observations, climate records, computer model simulations, and geological archives such as tree-rings, corals and ice-cores from past millennia of Earth history, the researchers found that a synchronization of the monsoon with the strongest mode of natural climate variability, the El Niño, makes it easier to anticipate the strength of seasonal rainfall in the Indian subcontinent.","""The tiny particles and gases that a large volcano blasts into the air enter into the stratosphere and remain there for a few years. While the volcanic matter in the stratosphere to some extent blocks sunshine from reaching the Earth's surface , the reduced solar forcing increases the probability of an El Niño event in the next year,"" says R. Krishnan from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. ""This is because less sunshine means less warmth and hence a change of temperature differences between the Northern and Southern hemisphere, which in turn affects the atmospheric large-scale circulation and precipitation dynamics. Advanced data analysis now reveals that large volcanic eruptions are more likely to promote the coincidence of warm El Niño events over the Pacific and Indian monsoon droughts -- or, in contrast, cool La Niña events over the Pacific and Indian monsoon excess.The Indian monsoon strongly depends on the El Niño / Southern Oscillation -- a climatic phenomenon in the tropical Pacific Ocean whose Spanish name means 'the boy', referring to the Christ child because the water near South America is often at its warmest near Christmas. ""The synchronization between tropical Pacific Ocean and Indian monsoon is changing over time, with human-made global warming being one of the factors, worsening the accurate prediction of the monsoon,"" says Norbert Marwan from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). ""This in fact confirms a hypothesis that our colleagues Maraun and Kurths launched 15 years ago. The new findings now suggest a novel, additional path for monsoon predictions that are crucial for agricultural planning in India."" Previous research from PIK already substantially improved Monsoon prediction for years without volcanic eruptions.The findings can also help further developing climate models and could in fact also help assessing the regional implications of geo-engineering experiments. To reduce global warming from human-made greenhouse gases, some scientists envision solar radiation management -- basically to block a portion of sunrays from warming Earth's surface by putting dust in the high atmosphere, similar to what the natural phenomenon of a volcanic eruption does. Artificially blocking sunshine, however, might dangerously interfere with a number of processes in the atmosphere.

That's the conclusion reached by a research team at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory after making the first-ever measurements of liquid water at temperatures much colder than its typical freezing point.,"The finding, published today in the journal The argument matters because understanding water, which covers 71 percent of the Earth's surface, is critical to understanding how it regulates our environment, our bodies and life itself.""We showed that liquid water at extremely cold temperatures is not only relatively stable, it exists in two structural motifs,"" said Greg Kimmel, a chemical physicist at PNNL. ""The findings explain a long-standing controversy over whether or not deeply supercooled water always crystallizes before it can equilibrate. The answer is: no.""You'd think we understand water by now. It's one of the most abundant and most studied substances on the planet. But despite its seeming simplicity -- two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen per molecule -- HIt is surprisingly difficult for water to freeze just below its melting point: water resists freezing unless it has something to get it started, like dust or some other solid to cling to. In pure water, it takes an energetic nudge to jostle the molecules into the special arrangement needed to freeze. And it expands when it freezes, which is weird behavior compared with other liquids. But that weirdness is what sustains life on Earth. If ice cubes sank or water vapor in the atmosphere didn't retain warmth, life on Earth as we know it wouldn't exist.Water's weird behavior has kept chemical physicists Bruce Kay and Greg Kimmel occupied for more than 25 years. Now, they and postdoctoral scientists Loni Kringle and Wyatt Thornley have accomplished a milestone that they hope will expand our understanding of the contortions liquid water molecules can make.Various models have been proposed to explain water's unusual properties. The new data obtained using a sort of stop-motion ""snapshot"" of supercooled water shows that it can condense into a high-density, liquid-like structure. This higher density form co-exists with a lower-density structure that is more in line with the typical bonding expected for water. The proportion of high-density liquid decreases rapidly as the temperature goes from -18.7 F (245 K) to -117.7 F (190 K), supporting predictions of ""mixture"" models for supercooled water.Kringle and Thornley used infrared spectroscopy to spy on the water molecules trapped in a kind of stop motion when a thin film of ice got zapped with a laser, creating a supercooled liquid water for a few fleeting nanoseconds.""A key observation is that all of the structural changes were reversible and reproducible,"" said Kringle, who performed many of the experiments.This research may help explain graupel, the fluffy pellets that sometimes fall during cool- weather storms. Graupel forms when a snowflake interacts with supercooled liquid water in the upper atmosphere.""Liquid water in the upper atmosphere is deeply cooled,"" says Kay, a PNNL lab fellow and expert in the physics of water. ""When it encounters a snowflake it rapidly freezes and then in the right conditions, falls to Earth. It's really the only time most people will experience the effects of supercooled water.""These studies may also help understand how liquid water can exist on very cold planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- in our solar system, and beyond. Supercooled water vapor also creates the beautiful tails that trail behind comets.Here on Earth, a better understanding of the contortions water can perform when placed in a tight situation, such as a single water molecule wedged into a protein, could help scientists design new medicines.""There isn't a lot of space for the water molecules that surround individual proteins,"" said Kringle. ""This research could shed light on how liquid water behaves in closely packed environments.""Thornley noted that ""in future studies, we can use this new technique to follow the molecular rearrangements underlying a broad range of chemical reactions.""There is still much to be learned, and these measurements will help lead the way to a better understanding of the most abundant life-giving liquid on Earth.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have discovered that liquid water can exist in two structural motifs at extremely cold temperatures, and that it is relatively stable.

""If this were indeed possible, we also wanted to explore how to get there and, more specifically, what type of actions would be required, and how combining various types of actions might reduce trade-offs among objectives.""The study comes at a relevant time for international discussions related to climate, conservation and food systems, including the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which is taking stock of its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020.The research was also featured in the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook, released this week.""We found that apart from increased conservation efforts, the most important actions to revert the loss of biodiversity are all related to how we manage the food system,"" said Mario Herrero, the chief research scientist for agriculture and food at CSIRO, Australia's national research agency. ""Key transitions towards healthy and sustainable diets, renewed waste reduction efforts and increases in productivity will help enormously restore ecosystems. These are central elements where we need investment and action and are an integral part of the forthcoming World Food Summit.""Even under a best-case scenario, ongoing land conversion will drive further biodiversity loss before the curve starts bending. At least a third of the projected losses in the coming years are unlikely to be avoided under any scenario. Potential biodiversity losses were found to be highest in the regions richest in biodiversity, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America.The study's baseline projections for biodiversity loss -- which include global and local extinctions and reductions in viable population levels for plants and animals -- will be driven by the loss of about 5.3 million km2 of unmanaged forest and natural vegetation by 2050. To have a chance at reversing biodiversity loss -- or bending the biodiversity curve towards restoration -- about 9.8 million km2 must be restored by 2050. This implies a significant increase to the Bonn Challenge, an international agreement to bring 3.5 million km2 into restoration by 2030.While study does not factor in the impact of climate change, the authors discuss climate's increasing role in biodiversity loss, writing:""Land-use change is currently the largest single threat to biodiversity, but other threats will increase in importance in the future, in particular climate change.""Additionally, the ""Integrated Action Portfolio"" proposed by the researchers to address biodiversity loss implies doubling crop yields in SSA, which will be no easy feat. ""While significant yield gaps prevailing in this region might offer opportunities, closing the yield gap in a sustainable manner will require investments and innovative policies, and might be complicated by climate change,"" they wrote.""We need to adopt a zero land conversion approach,"" said DeClerck. ""We need to realize that doubling productivity in SSA amongst others is a core contribution to the biodiversity and food security challenge, combined with producing the foods that contribute to, rather than detract from public health.""While a rapidly shifting climate is hurting biodiversity, Climate will also play a big role in the sustainable intensification of agriculture, especially in places like sub-Saharan Africa where agricultural production will need to increase considerably in order to meet land conservation goals.Terrestrial habitats will need to be better protected, the researchers argue. Even if current global agreements to protect 17 percent of land by 2020 are more than doubled to 40 percent and include biodiversity hotspots, about half of biodiversity losses projected under the study's baseline scenario will not be avoided.But the effectiveness of protected areas is declining as pressures on those areas are growing.The report is not all bad news. Complementing research published in the past couple of years, the team found that integrated efforts that target habitat conservation, improved production practices and significant shifts towards healthy and less wasteful diets enable reversing the loss of biodiversity. These efforts are similarly necessary to achieve climate security and are not incompatible with global food security targets. Urgent action is needed this decade, however, to have any chance of transitioning to a net-nature positive scenario.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study published in the journal Nature has found that the most important actions to revert the loss of biodiversity are all related to how we manage the food system.

If greenhouse gas emissions continue apace, Greenland and Antarctica's ice sheets could together contribute more than 15 inches (38 centimeters) of global sea level rise -- and that's beyond the amount that has already been set in motion by Earth's warming climate.","The results point to a greater range of possibilities, from ice sheet change that decreases sea level by 3.1 in (7.8 cm), to increasing it by 12 in (30 cm) by 2100, with different climate scenarios and climate model inputs. The regional projections show the greatest loss in West Antarctica, responsible for up to 7.1 in (18 cm) of sea level rise by 2100 in the warmest conditions, according to the research.""The Amundsen Sea region in West Antarctica and Wilkes Land in East Antarctica are the two regions most sensitive to warming ocean temperatures and changing currents, and will continue to lose large amounts of ice,"" said He?le?ne Seroussi, an ice scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Seroussi led the Antarctic ice sheet modeling in the ISMIP6 effort. ""With these new results, we can focus our efforts in the correct direction and know what needs to be worked on to continue improving the projections.""Different groups within the ISMIP6 community are working on various aspects of the ice sheet modeling effort. All are designed to better understand why the ice sheets are changing and to improve estimates of how much ice sheets will contribute to sea level rise. Other recent ISMIP6 studies include:""It took over six years of workshops and teleconferences with scientists from around the world working on ice sheet, atmosphere, and ocean modeling to build a community that was able to ultimately improve our sea level rise projections,"" Nowicki said. ""The reason it worked is because the polar community is small, and we're all very keen on getting this problem of future sea level right. We need to know these numbers.""The new results will help inform the Sixth IPCC report scheduled for release in 2022.Results from this effort are in line with projections in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2019 Special Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere. Meltwater from ice sheets contribute about a third of the total global sea level rise. The IPCC report projected that Greenland would contribute 3.1 to 10.6 inches (8 to 27 cm) to global sea level rise between 2000-2100 and Antarctica could contribute 1.2 to 11 inches (3 to 28 cm).These new results, published this week in a special issue of the journal The ""One of the biggest uncertainties when it comes to how much sea level will rise in the future is how much the ice sheets will contribute,"" said project leader and ice scientist Sophie Nowicki, now at the University at Buffalo, and formerly at NASA Goddard. ""And how much the ice sheets contribute is really dependent on what the climate will do.""""The strength of ISMIP6 was to bring together most of the ice sheet modeling groups around the world, and then connect with other communities of ocean and atmospheric modelers as well, to better understand what could happen to the ice sheets,"" said Heiko Goelzer, a scientist from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, now at NORCE Norwegian Research Centre in Norway. Goelzer led the Greenland ice sheet ISMIP6 effort.With warming air temperatures melting the surface of the ice sheet, and warming ocean temperatures causing ocean-terminating glaciers to retreat, Greenland's ice sheet is a significant contributor to sea level rise. The ISMIP6 team investigated two different scenarios the IPCC has set for future climate to predict sea level rise between 2015 and 2100: one with carbon emissions increasing rapidly and another with lower emissions.In the high emissions scenario, they found that the Greenland ice sheet would lead to an additional global sea level rise of about 3.5 inches (9 cm) by 2100. In the lower emissions scenario, the loss from the ice sheet would raise global sea level by about 1.3 inches (3 cm). This is beyond what is already destined to be lost from the ice sheet due to warming temperatures between pre-industrial times and now; previous studies have estimated that 'locked in' contribution to global sea level rise by 2100 to be about a quarter-inch (6 millimeters) for the Greenland ice sheet.The ISMIP6 team also analyzed the Antarctic ice sheet to understand how much ice melt from future climate change would add to sea level rise, beyond what recent warming temperatures have already put in motion. Ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is more difficult to predict: In the west, warm ocean currents erode the bottom of large floating ice shelves, causing loss; while the vast East Antarctic ice sheet can gain mass, as warmer temperatures cause increased snowfall.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study led by NASA has found that the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet could cause sea levels to rise by up to 30cm by the end of the century.

These primeval landscapes, scattered on remote hillsides and forested valleys across many countries, are a ""living treasure,"" says University of Vermont scientist Bill Keeton.","A new study, by scientists from 28 institutions including UVM, presents the first comprehensive assessment of the conservation status of these primary forests in Europe -- and shows that many of them are not protected and at risk of being destroyed.Gathering data and mapping for five years, the team's research makes clear that Europe's ancient forests are in a perilous state -- and that many of them continue to be logged. The researchers conclude that formal conservation of these forests should be a top priority for countries to meet their climate change and biodiversity goals.""While many primary forests are in fact well protected, we also found many regions where they are not -- particularly where primary forests are still common,"" says Francesco Sabatini, the study's lead author from the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research and Martin Luther University, Halle-Wittenberg. ""And where they are protected, in some cases, the level of protection is inadequate to ensure these forests will be protected in the long-term.""The study also highlights that remaining primary forests are very unevenly distributed across Europe. ""Some regions, particularly in Scandinavia and Finland as well as Eastern Europe, still have many primary forests. But often those countries do not realize how unique their forests are at the European scale and how important it is to protect them,"" says senior author Tobias Kuemmerle from Humboldt University in Berlin. ""At the same time, we were shocked to see that there are many natural forests types in Europe without any primary forest remaining at all, particularly in Western Europe.""The European Union has recently put forward a new Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 that highlights the value of old-growth forest; the results of this new study provide valuable information for implementing this strategy, the team notes.The new research was published on September 16, 2020, in the journal Earlier research by this same team had shown that many primary forests remain in Europe and modelled where others are likely to occur. ""But what we didn't know: are these remaining primary forests representative of the 54 forest types found in Europe? How much of each forest type is protected? And where are opportunities to restore old-growth forest?"" says UVM's Bill Keeton, second author on the new study, professor of forest ecology and forestry in the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, and fellow in the Gund Institute for Environment. ""This research answers these critical questions.""Primary forests are forests without signs of past human use and where ecological processes are not disrupted by human influence. ""Primary and old-growth forests have huge value for biodiversity, for carbon and climate mitigation, for flood resilience and other ecological values -- and they're important as part of Europe's historical legacy just like their ancient cities and cathedrals,"" says Keeton. In Europe, where millennia of land use have transformed forested landscapes, very few such forests remain, and these are mostly found in remote and relatively unproductive areas.The new study found a ""substantial bias,"" the scientists write, in how these remaining primary forests are distributed across forest types. Of the 54 forest types they assessed, they found that six had no remaining old-growth stands at all. And in two-thirds of the forest types, they found that less than one percent was old growth. And only ten forest types had more than half of their old growth strictly protected.In other words, even if scarce and irreplaceable, many of these primary forests are not legally protected and continue to be logged in Europe. However, with swift action, strict conservation protections on those that remain can be put in place, the team says -- plus: old-growth forests, and their many values, can be restored.""Notre Dame burned, but it's being restored,"" says UVM's Keeton. ""It won't be exactly the same as the original construction -- and there's debate over architectural details and what style to use for its spire -- but it will return as an inspiring, ancient place for reflection and worship. The active restoration of old-growth forests is similar. We're not going to create exactly what was there before, but many functions, like habitat and carbon storage, can return."" The new study identifies many of the most promising areas for this kind of work.""Forest restoration to establish primary forests will take a long time, but it is attractive because such forests will not only benefit biodiversity but also store a lot of carbon and therefore help to mitigate climate change,"" says Tobias Kuemmerle. ""The good news is that there are huge opportunities for restoring primary forests even within existing protected areas, which means that restoration efforts would not necessarily require reducing the area of forests used for timber production.""""Now is the time to be ambitious. There is a lot of momentum for forest conservation and restoration in Europe at the moment,"" says Francesco Sabatini, in part because of the European Union's Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 that explicitly recognizes the irreplaceable value of primary forests. ""Our study provides a foundation for putting this strategy into practice,"" he says.""Our work shows that all the remaining primary forests in Europe could be protected with a modest expansion of protected areas,"" says UVM's Bill Keeton, ""and I think this study will change the whole dialogue around old forest restoration in Europe, highlighting where that would be most valuable.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study led by scientists from 28 institutions, including the University of Vermont, has found that many of Europe's ancient forests are at risk of being destroyed as they are not protected.

Intense tropical weathering and local biomass burning have both contributed to nutrient-poor soil in the Amazon Basin.,"The research team analyzed 15 years of daily measurements of African dust transported in trade winds and collected at a coastal research station in Cayenne, French Guiana. The results showed that significant quantities of dust reach the heart of the Amazon Basin and are deposited there.""African dust provides an important source of nutrients to enhance Amazonian soil fertility,"" said Joseph Prospero, professor emeritus at the UM Rosenstiel School and lead author of the study.Every year, mineral-rich dust from North Africa's Sahara Desert is lifted into the atmosphere by winds and carried on a 5,000-mile journey across the North Atlantic to the Americas. African dust contains phosphorus and other important plant nutrients that help offset soil losses and increase Amazonian soil fertility.This study, the first to quantify African dust transport to South America, showed that significant amounts of dust is deposited to the Amazon. The analysis also found that previous studies, which were based on limited measurements of dust, may have greatly overestimated the impact.The Amazon Basin plays a major role in global climate. Trees and plants in the Amazon remove huge quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store the carbon in vegetation.

This study digs into the geological record for confirmation of model results.Researchers pulled together records from marine sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic to get a detailed look at sea ice throughout the region over the last 1400 years.""We decided to put together different strands of evidence to try to reconstruct spatially and temporally what the sea ice was during the past one and a half thousand years, and then just see what we found,"" said Martin Miles, an INSTAAR researcher who also holds an appointment with NORCE Norwegian Research Centre and Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Norway.The cores included compounds produced by algae that live in sea ice, the shells of single-celled organisms that live in different water temperatures, and debris that sea ice picks up and transports over long distances. The cores were detailed enough to detect abrupt (decadal scale) changes in sea ice and ocean conditions over time.The records indicate an abrupt increase in Arctic sea ice exported to the North Atlantic starting around 1300, peaking in midcentury, and ending abruptly in the late 1300s.""I've always been fascinated by not just looking at sea ice as a passive indicator of climate change, but how it interacts with or could actually lead to changes in the climate system on long timescales,"" said Miles. ""And the perfect example of that could be the Little Ice Age.""""This specific investigation was inspired by an INSTAAR colleague, Giff Miller, as well as by some of the paleoclimate reconstructions of my INSTAAR colleagues Anne Jennings, John Andrews, and Astrid Ogilvie,"" added Miles. Miller authored the first paper to suggest that sea ice played an essential role in sustaining the Little Ice Age.Scientists have argued about the causes of the Little Ice Age for decades, with many suggesting that explosive volcanic eruptions must be essential for initiating the cooling period and allowing it to persist over centuries. One the hand, the new reconstruction provides robust evidence of a massive sea-ice anomaly that could have been triggered by increased explosive volcanism. One the other hand, the same evidence supports an intriguing alternate explanation.Climate models called ""control models"" are run to understand how the climate system works through time without being influenced by outside forces like volcanic activity or greenhouse gas emissions. A set of recent control model experiments included results that portrayed sudden cold events that lasted several decades. The model results seemed too extreme to be realistic -- so-called Ugly Duckling simulations -- and researchers were concerned that they were showing problems with the models.Miles' study found that there may be nothing wrong with those models at all.""We actually find that number one, we do have physical, geological evidence that these several decade-long cold sea ice excursions in the same region can, in fact do, occur,"" he said. In the case of the Little Ice Age, ""what we reconstructed in space and time was strikingly similar to the development in an Ugly Duckling model simulation, in which a spontaneous cold event lasted about a century. It involved unusual winds, sea ice export, and a lot more ice east of Greenland, just as we found in here."" The provocative results show that external forcing from volcanoes or other causes may not be necessary for large swings in climate to occur. Miles continued, ""These results strongly suggest...that these things can occur out of the blue due to internal variability in the climate system.""The marine cores also show a sustained, far-flung pulse of sea ice near the Norse colonies on Greenland coincident with their disappearance in the 15th century. A debate has raged over why the colonies vanished, usually agreeing only that a cooling climate pushed hard on their resilience. Miles and his colleagues would like to factor in the oceanic changes nearby: very large amounts of sea ice and cold polar waters, year after year for nearly a century.""This massive belt of ice that comes streaming out of the Arctic -- in the past and even today -- goes all the way around Cape Farewell to around where these colonies were,"" Miles said. He would like to look more closely into oceanic conditions along with researchers who study the social sciences in relation to climate.",Climate,2020.0,A new study has found physical evidence to support previous numerical climate models that suggest increased sea ice was necessary to explain long-lasting climate anomalies like the Little Ice Age.

Drought has serious negative impacts on both human society and the natural world and is generally projected to increase under global climate change. As a result, assessment of the risk of drought under climate change is a critical area of climate research.","In the 2015 Paris Agreements, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) proposed that the increase in global average temperature should be limited to between 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels to limit the effects of severe climate change. However, there have been few studies focusing on the relative importance of this 0.5°C of global average temperature rise and what effect it might have on drought and aridity around the world.""We wanted to contribute to the understanding of how important that 0.5°C could be, but it such a study is not easy to conduct based on previous modeling approaches,"" explains corresponding author Hyungjun Kim. ""This is mainly because most models look at the extreme high levels and you cannot simply take a slice out of the data while the model spins up to this maximum. Therefore, we used data from the specially designed Half a degree Additional warming Prognosis and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project to assess the impacts on aridity based on estimations of the balance between water and energy at the Earth's surface.""The study revealed that 2°C of warming led to more frequent dry years and more severe aridification in most areas of the world compared with 1.5°C, which emphasizes that efforts should be made to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.""There is a really strong message that some parts of the world could have more frequent drought at 2°C than at 1.5°C.

As the sea level rises, large areas of densely populated coastal land will become uninhabitable. It is vital that we understand the impact climate change interventions could have on the rate of melting and, consequently, changes in sea level.The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6), consisting of more than 60 scientists from 36 institutions across the world -- including Dr. Christopher Chambers and Professor Ralf Greve from the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University -- has used the latest generation of models to estimate the impact of global warming on ice sheets. Their results were published in a special issue of the journal The The ISMIP6 team projected the changes of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets (GrIS/AIS) between 2015 and 2100 under global warming conditions predicted by climate modelling. The advantage of ISMIP6 was that it used fourteen different models to estimate the changes in the ice sheet under two greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathways: the pessimistic scenario, where there is no change in current trends, leading to a rapid increase in GHG emissions; and the optimistic scenario, where comprehensive steps are taken to reduce GHG emissions. Using different models to estimate the changes was vital to this endeavour, as they have different baselines and assumptions.Ralf Greve and Christopher Chambers modelled the behavior of ice sheets using the SICOPOLIS model. The first version was released in 1995 by Greve, and since then it has been continuously developed and used for a large number of studies. The SICOPOLIS model uses data from 1990 as a baseline for the experiments. As the model has a 25-year history with an uninterrupted development and publication record, it brought a unique perspective to ISMIP6.The rate of ice sheet change was modelled under different forcings provided by climate models: future changes of precipitation, surface melting over the ice sheets, surface and ocean temperatures. The goal was to estimate how much the mass loss of the ice sheets would contribute to the rise in average sea levels beyond what has already been put in motion. The study found that, by 2100, the GrIS would raise sea levels by 4-14 cm under the pessimistic scenario, but only 1.5-5 cm under the optimistic scenario. For the AIS, the results point to a greater range of possibilities, from ice sheet change that decreases sea level by 7.8 cm to increasing it by 30 cm under the pessimistic scenario, and an increase of 0-3 cm under the optimistic scenario.""Mass change from the AIS is notoriously difficult to predict: Increasing ocean temperatures erode the bottom of large floating ice shelves, causing loss; while the AIS can also gain mass by increased snowfall due to warmer air temperatures. However, we are constantly improving our understanding of the ice sheets and their interaction with the Earth's climate system. Modelling intercomparison studies like ISMIP6 are an effective tool to provide society with the necessary information, including uncertainties, for rational decisions,"" said Ralf Greve.This effort took over six years of collaboration, and the findings of ISMIP6 will help inform the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scheduled for release in 2022. ISMIP6 is part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).

The corals were then raised in the lab for one year under the same conditions.Scientists observed that the skeletons of dead corals, which support and hold up living corals, had become porous due to ocean acidification and rapidly become too fragile to bear the weight of the reef above them.Previous research has shown that ocean acidification can impact coral growth, but the new study demonstrates that porosity in corals -- known as coralporosis -- leads to weakening of their structure at critical locations.This causes early breakage and crumbling, experts say, that may cause whole coral ecosystems to shrink dramatically in the future, leaving them only able to support a small fraction of the marine life they are home to today.The findings complement recent evidence of porosity in tropical corals, but demonstrate that the threat posed by ocean acidification is far greater for deep-sea coral reefs.Research was led by University of Edinburgh scientists, under the EU-funded ATLAS and iAtlantic projects, with researchers from Heriot-Watt University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The team identified how reefs could become fractured by analysing corals from the longest-running laboratory studies to date, and by diving with submersibles off US Pacific shores to observe how coral habitat is lost as the water becomes more acidic.Dr Sebastian Hennige, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, said: ""This study highlights that a major threat to these wonderful deep-sea ecosystems is structural weakening caused by ocean acidification, driven by the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide we produce. While deep-sea reefs exist out of sight they are certainly not out of mind, and our work highlights how scientists from different disciplines and countries can join together to tackle global challenges.""The corals in Southern California -- one the most acidified reefs studied to date -- are already experiencing the effects of climate change and exist in conditions that most deep-sea reefs are expected to encounter by the end of the century, scientists say.Dr. Peter Etnoyer, of NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, said: ""Deep-sea corals growing off Southern California are a window into the future ocean. The region is a natural laboratory to study the effects of ocean acidification.""Submersibles were launched from NOAA ships off Southern California, and were guided by Dr. Peter Etnoyer and graduate student Leslie Wickes.The US team sampled live corals and returned them to the laboratory for experiments. The UK team applied engineering principles to demonstrate the rapid weakening of the skeletons and discovered a striking similarity to the weakening observed in human bones from osteoporosis.The team says that the link between osteoporosis and coralporosis opens up a range of methods and concepts that can be adapted in the challenge of monitoring and predicting the fate of such fragile deep-sea ecosystems and the life they support.Dr. Uwe Wolfram, of Heriot-Watt University, said: ""By being able to adapt strategies to coral reefs that are used routinely to monitor osteoporosis and assess bone fracture risk, we may have powerful non-invasive tools at our disposal to monitor these fragile ecosystems.""Tools developed as part of the project will aid understanding of when ocean ecosystems will change and how it will affect marine life.This will better equip society to deal with how these vulnerable ecosystems can be protected in the future, and will support the UN Decade of Ocean Science -- which starts in 2021 -- to deliver the science we need, for the ocean we want, the team says.Professor J Murray Roberts, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who leads the ATLAS and iAtlantic programmes, said: ""Cold-water corals are truly the cities of the deep-sea providing homes to countless other animals. If we lose the corals the city crumbles. This project is a great example of how we can work across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to understand the impacts of rapidly changing ocean conditions.""The research is published in the journal ",Climate,2020.0,"Deep-sea coral reefs could fracture due to ocean acidification caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide, according to a study by scientists from the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Planet Ocean-Cloud is much more fitting than Earth, they'll say, when so much of our planet's life systems are affected by the interactions of clouds and the oceans.","The ability to predict the behavior of clouds gives meteorologists, climate scientists, physicists and others a better understanding of change of precipitation (currently one of the most difficult aspects of weather forecasting to predict) and improves climate modeling.Last week, Prasanth Prabhakaran, Will Cantrell and Raymond Shaw, along with several coauthors, published ""The role of turbulent fluctuations in aerosol activation and cloud formation"" in the journal ""There are very few absolutes in life and I'm about to give you one of them: When you look up in the sky, every cloud droplet you see formed on a preexisting speck of dust. But not every speck of dust will give you a cloud droplet,"" said Will Cantrell, professor of physics.""If you give me the atmospheric conditions, I can give you a pretty good idea of whether the speck of dust will form a cloud droplet. So far in atmospheric science, what we haven't accounted for is the fact that the atmosphere is turbulent,"" Cantrell said. ""If the dust particles were identical, but they are exposed to different conditions, that will play a role in whether they become cloud droplets.""The role of turbulence in cloud formation is the gap Cantrell's research steps into. Traditionally, the mechanics of cloud formation have not accounted for turbulence. Prabhakaran and coauthors have developed a framework, backed with experiments from Tech's cloud chamber, to explain how preexisting aerosol (dust) particles -- the seeds of cloud droplets -- make the transition to becoming droplets (and thus become eligible to start the process of falling on your garden).Michigan Tech's cloud chamber is one of only two in the world capable of performing such experiments. Shaw, distinguished professor of physics and director of Michigan Tech's atmospheric sciences PhD program, is also affiliated with the other: the LACIS-T chamber in Leipzig, Germany, at the Institute for Tropospheric Research. Clouds can be maintained for hours in Michigan Tech's chamber, a huge advantage over in situ experiments in a jet outfitted with measurement equipment traveling a hundred meters a second through a cloud.""Under controlled conditions we investigated the aspects of cloud formation,"" said Prabhakaran, who is a postdoctoral research scholar in Michigan Tech's department of physics. ""Modeling under different regimes shows how cloud droplets form and the significance of formation of cloud droplets under the conditions we have, whether it's a highly polluted environment or out in a relatively clean environment like out over the ocean.""Atmospheric conditions matter: In clean conditions, all researchers need to know are the mean values such as average water vapor concentration and average temperature, to have enough information to predict whether dust specks will become cloud droplets. Under more polluted conditions, the exact conditions the particles are exposed to becomes more important.""The way that clouds interact with sunlight and whether they precipitate will depend a lot on how many droplets and how big they are,"" Cantrell said. ""Understanding the transition from dust to cloud droplets is a key part of understanding whether you'll have a lot or few droplets. Our theory adds a way to understand whether the turbulent mixing in the atmosphere will affect the number of droplets you get, and that cascades into other properties of cloud formation.""To conduct the experiment, the researchers created a turbulent environment inside the 3.14 meters cubed cloud chamber by heating the chamber's lower plate and cooling the top plate to create a turbulent, convective flow. Into the flow the team introduced 130-nanometer sodium chloride aerosol particles. By varying the temperature differential between the top and bottom plates and the number of aerosol particles in the chamber, the researchers saw differences in how clouds formed.Based on those observations, the research team developed a semiquantitative theory to describe the conditions. Whether aerosol particles become droplets has a tremendous effect on the properties of clouds, and the Michigan Tech experiments and model provide a framework to categorize droplet formation in numerical models.Cantrell said turbulence has not been a part of the cloud physics curriculum until very recently.""Our measurements in the chamber show that turbulence can mimic the behaviors that have been attributed to particle variation, primarily size and composition. This experiment changes our understanding of the properties of the clouds and we become better able to represent those processes in climate models,"" he said.The researchers said their model will help forecasters predict the fluctuations Planet Ocean-Cloud will experience as the climate changes.""Hopefully within a few years, this will improve the observations of climate models for predicting long-term climate change,"" Prabhakaran said.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers at Michigan Tech have developed a framework to explain how pre-existing aerosol (dust) particles, the seeds of cloud droplets, make the transition to becoming droplets.

Visibility will also decline along three scenic national byways in the Colorado Rockies -- even if climate conditions remain at historical levels. They saw the greatest declines in the visible landscape areas.""Aspen are sensitive to drought and warming temperatures, and empirically we are already starting to see declines,"" said the study's senior author Jelena Vukomanovic, assistant professor in the NC State Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management. ""Even if we keep current conditions, we will see declines in aspen. But under worsening climate change, the decline in aspen will be worse.""In the study, researchers modeled the distribution of quaking aspen trees visible under three scenarios: If climate does not change from historical conditions observed from 1980 to 2010; under a 4-degree temperature increase with 15 percent less precipitation; and with a 4-degree decline and 15 percent more precipitation.For each scenario, their simulation modeled whether aspens were visible from 32,949 different vantage points along three scenic roadways in Colorado: Cache la Poudre, Trail Ridge Road and Peak-to-Peak Highway. They used a computer model of forest dynamics called the Landscape Disturbance and Succession (LANDIS-II) model to forecast where aspen will grow and used U.S. Geological Survey elevation data to model visibility along scenic roads.In addition to factoring in changes in temperature and precipitation, they also modeled how wildfires, insects and wind events would impact aspen tree growth and distribution. These trees are intolerant of drought and shade, researchers said, but they are often the first to colonize a burned area.Overall, they found that aspen are expected to decline in all three climate scenarios. In the two warmer scenarios, the losses were more than two times greater overall, and aspen loss was even greater in the visible areas from the scenic byways.""We can say with good confidence that these main arteries of movement through the mountains will see a noticeable decline in visible aspen, and the loss of visible aspen is greater than the overall loss,"" said Vukomanovic. ""It's hard to predict what people will do -- build new roads, new outlooks, or create new opportunities to view the remaining stands -- but there could be a negative impact to some of the communities along these routes that rely on tourism dollars from aspen viewing.""They saw that the changes in aspen varied depending on the elevation. Aspen at the lowest elevations, where they are the least abundant, saw increases under all three scenarios, but the increases were smaller with climate change. Researchers hypothesized that at these elevations, the model was capturing aspen regeneration after wildfire, but they regenerate to a lesser degree under the more extreme climate change scenarios.""We think they are increasing at lower elevations because they're colonizing recently burned places,"" Vukomanovic said. ""Because there's been such active fire suppression at the lower elevations where people live, when fire comes, it creates opportunities for the aspen to colonize new places. But these gains are tiny compared to losses at higher elevations.""At the middle elevations of 2,000 to 3,000 meters, where aspen are most abundant, they saw consistent decreases across all three scenarios. At the highest elevations above 3,000 meters, they saw lower declines under the climate warming scenarios. They believe this means aspen distributions will shift to higher elevations as the climate warms.""As drought and higher temperatures at lower elevations start to increase the vulnerability of aspens to pathogens like bugs, fungi and bacteria, their suitable climate will shift upwards,"" said Nikki C. Inglis, a research assistant and graduate student in the Center for Geospatial Analytics at NC State and first author of the study.Researchers said their study is important because it is evidence for how climate change will be visible to people. In addition, the aspen trees in particular are an important feature of the Colorado landscape.""They are part of how people who live in Colorado identify themselves, and what makes this a unique landscape,"" Inglis said. ""They draw people in from all over because the aspen trees create a sensory experience with sound and sight.

Laboratory experiments indicate that many could theoretically tolerate temperatures far higher than what they encounter today. But these studies don't mean that marine animals can maintain their current ranges in warmer oceans, according to Curtis Deutsch, an associate professor of oceanography at the University of Washington.","""Temperature alone does not explain where in the ocean an animal can live,"" said Deutsch. ""You must consider oxygen: how much is present in the water, how well an organism can take up and utilize it, and how temperature affects these processes.""Species-specific characteristics, overall oxygen levels and water temperature combine to determine which parts of the ocean are ""breathable"" for different ocean-dwelling creatures. New research led by Deutsch shows that a wide variety of marine animals -- from vertebrates to crustaceans to mollusks -- already inhabit the maximum range of breathable ocean that their physiology will allow.The findings, published Sept. 16 in ""Organisms today are basically living right up to the warmest temperatures possible that will supply them with adequate oxygen for their activity level -- so higher temperatures are going to immediately affect their ability to get enough oxygen,"" said Deutsch. ""In response to warming, their activity level is going to be restricted or their habitat is going to start shrinking. It's not like they're going to be fine and just carry on.""Oxygen levels and temperatures vary throughout ocean waters. Generally, water near the equator is warmer and contains less oxygen than the cooler waters near the poles. But moving from the surface ocean to deeper waters, both oxygen and temperature decrease together. These principles create complex 3-D patterns of oxygen and temperature levels across depths and latitudes. An organism's anatomy, physiology and activity level determine its oxygen needs, how effectively it takes up and uses the available oxygen in its environment, and how temperature affects its oxygen demand.Deutsch and his co-authors -- Justin Penn, a UW doctoral student in oceanography, and Brad Seibel, a professor at the University of South Florida -- wanted to understand if breathability was a limiting factor in determining the ranges of marine animals today. They combined data on temperature and oxygen content across the oceans with published studies of the physiology, oxygen demand and metabolism of 72 species from five different groups of marine animals: cold-blooded vertebrates, like fish, and their relatives; crustaceans; mollusks; segmented worms; and jellyfish and their relatives.The team modeled which parts of the ocean are and aren't habitable for each species. Researchers show that a species' current range generally overlapped with the parts of the oceans predicted to be habitable for it. Their model predicts that the northern shrimp, a crustacean, should be able to get enough oxygen in cool waters north of about 50 degrees north latitude -- and that is generally the shrimp's range today. The small-spotted catshark can inhabit temperate and cool waters at a variety of depths, but near the tropics only near-surface waters -- above about 300 feet -- are breathable, which is also reflected in its current range.In many cases, species ranges are right up to the edge of breathability, which indicates that for marine animals the ability to get enough oxygen may be a major limiting factor in determining where they can live, Deutsch added. Outside of that range, organisms run the risk of hypoxia, or not getting enough oxygen.Temperature affects both how much oxygen that seawater can hold, and how much oxygen an animal needs to maintain the same level of activity. The already-tight overlap the researchers saw between breathability and current ranges indicate that long-term rises in temperature, as expected under climate change, will likely restrict the ranges of many marine animals.This new study follows a 2015 study of four Atlantic Ocean species by Deutsch's team, and builds on its findings by showing that diverse species in all ocean basins are generally inhabiting the maximum range they currently can.In the future, Deutsch wants to include additional species, and further explore the relationships among temperature, oxygen and physiology.The researchers would also like to find historical examples of marine species shifting their range in response to water breathability, as the team showed earlier this year with the northern anchovy.""What we really want to find are more observations of marine species moving around in accordance with what we'd expect with temperature conditions and oxygen availability,"" said Deutsch. ""That will give us firm examples of what to expect as temperature and oxygen conditions fluctuate, and shift permanently with climate change.""The research was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.Grant numbers: GBMF#3775, OCE-1419323, OCE-1458967",Climate,2020.0,"New research led by Curtis Deutsch from the University of Washington shows that a wide variety of marine animals, from vertebrates to crustaceans to mollusks, already inhabit the maximum range of breathable ocean that their physiology will allow.

As a result, permafrost that is thousands of years old is now being lost to erosion. As measurements gathered on the Lena River by AWI experts show, the scale of erosion is alarming: every year, roughly 15 metres of the riverbanks crumble away. In addition, the carbon stored in the permafrost could worsen the greenhouse effect.","Today, the permafrost soils found on the Arctic coasts of Canada, Russia and Alaska, frozen for thousands of years, are increasingly eroding away due to the effects of waves and river currents -- especially because the warm season there is steadily growing longer. As experts from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) have determined, this thawing has now taken on enormous proportions. By conducting a detailed analysis of historical satellite images from Siberia, Matthias Fuchs and his team were able to show that permafrost erosion in the Lena Delta has steadily worsened since the 1960s. Whereas in the 1960s the river, at a width of ca. 1.7 kilometres, gnawed away an average of five metres of land per year, between 2015 and 2018 that number rose to nearly 16 metres. In total the banks -- more in some places, less in others -- lost between 322 and 679 metres from 1965 to 2018.The researchers focused their efforts on the 1.5-kilometre-long Sobo-Sise Cliff, a steep yedoma cliff from which permafrost plummets into a branch of the Lena River. At its highest point, it is 27 metres tall -- as tall as a several-storey house. As Matthias Fuchs explains, ""Major quantities of permafrost have been eroding away across the Arctic for many years now. Nevertheless, the Sobo-Sise Cliff is definitely a hotspot. There are very few other regions where the loss of land is so substantial."" The worrisome aspect: the fact that the thawing and permafrost loss have intensified so massively in the last several years.Fuchs and his colleagues not only analysed satellite data; they also took a closer look at how much carbon and nitrogen are released every year by the erosion. The cliff's permafrost, which is ca. 50,000 years old and formed during the last Ice Age, consists of 88 percent ice. The remainder is mainly peat, silt and sand. Especially the peat, which consists of partially decomposed ancient mosses and sedges, contains a great amount of carbon and nitrogen, formerly stored in the plants. The AWI experts collected soil samples on site and then analysed their carbon and nitrogen content in the lab. ""It's amazing that the Sobo-Sise Cliff contains so much organic material, even though it's predominantly composed of ice. On average, we find roughly 26 kilograms of carbon and two kilograms of nitrogen per cubic metre."" That means from 2015 to 2018 alone, ca. 15,000 metric tons of carbon and at least 1,000 metric tons of nitrogen landed in the Lena River, where they were washed away.""Carbon and nitrogen are important nutrients for microorganisms,"" Fuchs explains. ""Due to the erosion and thawing of permafrost, microorganisms now enjoy access to both."" And this can have a number of consequences. When the microbes break down the carbon, they release carbon dioxide -- just like we humans do when we breathe. When that happens, the loss of permafrost worsens the greenhouse effect by 're-mobilising' carbon that was previously stored away. In addition, the intensive input of carbon and nitrogen in the Lena is changing the nutrient supply in its waters. ""This could significantly influence, or even transform, the river's natural food webs,"" says Fuchs.The researchers can't yet say precisely what the consequences will be. To do so, in future studies they'll need to examine the nutrient flows in, and the biology of, the Lena river in more detail. But with their latest efforts and their assessment of the permafrost erosion, which has just been published in the journal ",Climate,2020.0,"Permafrost erosion in the Arctic, caused by longer warm seasons and wave and river currents, has accelerated in recent years, releasing carbon and nitrogen previously stored in the permafrost.

Coral bleaching is a direct result of global warming, where rising temperatures cause marine heat waves, which place stress on the living coral animals, as well as the photosynthetic algae on which they depend for energy. This heat stress causes the algae to malfunction, at which point they are expelled by the corals, causing the organisms to lose their color and appear white (thus the term coral ""bleaching"").","Due to the increasing pressure of global warming on highly valuable coral reef ecosystems, scientists are now seeking novel ways to decrease heat stress on corals. A new study led by Yvonne Sawall, assistant scientist at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), is showing potential for the use of artificial upwelling (AU) -- or the application of cooler, deep water -- as a way to mitigate the thermal stress on corals.Upwelling is a natural oceanographic process in which winds push surfaces waters away from a region, such as a coastline, allowing the uplift of deep, cold waters to the surface. These waters are typically rich in nutrients and form the basis of productive marine ecosystems which, in turn, support many of the world's most important commercial fisheries. AU is a geoengineering method that uses pumps to bring deep-ocean water to the surface. Originally designed to fertilize surface waters to increase fish stocks or carbon dioxide (CO""Ocean warming and the occurrence of heat waves will increase in frequency and intensity over the coming decades and we need to consider rather unconventional solutions to protect and sustain coral reefs,"" Sawall said.With funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG, with principal investigator Yuming Feng, doctoral student at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany), Sawall and her co-authors studied three shallow water reef building coral species in Bermuda: After collecting fragments from living corals on Sea Venture Shoals, Bermuda, at a depth of 15 feet (5 meters), the research team placed the colonies in aquaria at BIOS to test the effects of deep cold-water pulses (AU) during thermal stress. Fragments were treated with various temperatures conditions, including an average summer temperature (28°C); a heat stress treatment known to cause bleaching (31°C); a heat stress treatment with daily pulses of cooler deep water from a depth of 164 feet (50 m, 24°C); and a heat stress treatment with daily pulses of cooler deep water from a depth of 300 feet (100 m, 20°C). The deep water used for the experiment was collected aboard the BIOS-operated research vessel (R/V) The results of the study showed that even short intrusions of cooler deep water (less than two hours per day) can mitigate thermal stress in corals. This was evident in higher levels of zooxanthellae performance in corals exposed to heat stress and AU compared to corals that were exposed to heat stress only, and this effect seemed stronger in the simulations with water from deeper depths.""Our study shows the potential benefits of pulsed AU during heat waves.

This first of its kind research estimates potential releases of mercury from thawing permafrost under high and low carbon emissions scenarios. The researchers predict that by 2200, the mercury emitted into both the atmosphere and water annually by thawing permafrost will compare with current global anthropogenic mercury emissions. That's because higher carbon emissions lead to faster and more atmosphere and water, where it can accumulate in wildlife like fish.","The team's results were published Sept. 16 in ""If we can hit the Paris Accord target, we expect minimal impacts to mercury concentrations in fish and water. If we continue with unconstrained greenhouse gas emissions, however, it is likely that we will see large increases in mercury concentrations,"" said Kevin Schaefer, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and lead researcher on the project. Mercury emissions of these magnitudes could have a global impact. ""What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,"" said Schaefer, ""The mercury emissions from thawing permafrost could persist for centuries, impacting the environment both locally and globally.""In 2018, Schaefer and several of his colleagues found that permafrost soils store nearly twice as much mercury as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. That work was funded by NASA as part of the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), a major effort to improve understanding of how climate change is affecting Arctic ecosystems, and how those changes ultimately affect people and places in the Arctic and beyond. Now, the researchers have created a model -- which relies in part on data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite -- to predict how mercury emissions from thawing Arctic permafrost will change under different global emissions scenarios.The new paper characterizes the release of mercury from thawing permafrost for high and low carbon emissions scenarios based on two of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The high carbon emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) assumes unconstrained ""business as usual"" emissions, while the low carbon emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) assumes carbon emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement global target of less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels.The results indicate minimal impacts to mercury concentrations in water and fish for the low carbon emissions scenario and large increases for the high carbon emissions scenario. At the global level, the high carbon emissions scenario would significantly increase the amount of mercury released into the atmosphere, where it would persist in the environment for centuries. At a local level, this would result in large increases to mercury concentrations in fish and water in the Yukon River. For the high emissions scenario, mercury concentrations could double in the Yukon River by 2100. The low carbon emissions scenario shows minimal mercury releases to the atmosphere and small changes to mercury concentrations in fish and water. For the low emissions scenario, mercury concentrations would likely increase by only about 14 percent and would not exceed EPA criterion by 2300.""The thaw of permafrost due to climate change may release mercury as well as greenhouse gases like methane.

They have analyzed more than 30,000 satellite images and identified more than 36 million areas where large trees have given way to open spaces of young trees. This corresponds to a loss of the canopy in 17 percent of the European forests in 30 years.","The reasons for the canopy openings range from regulated wood use to wind storms and forest fires. The team also found that the size of the canopy openings varied widely from area to area.For example, Sweden has the largest canopy openings (averaging almost two hectares) while Portugal has the highest number of canopy openings. Switzerland has the smallest openings with just 0.6 hectares on average (which is smaller than a soccer field) while the average size opening in Germany is 0.7 hectares and in Italy 0.75 hectares. The largest opening documented by the researchers is in Spain, where a single fire in 2012 burned 17,000 hectares.The novel map the team has created also makes it possible to describe changes in forest conditions. The researchers have found, for example, that throughout Europe forests have become more open and the frequency of forests being interrupted by open spaces has increased. In addition, the openings themselves on average have increased in size primarily due to wind storms and forest fires in recent years.In such areas, however, the tendency is that more trees are surviving due to the availability of seed material. This, in turn, promotes the recovery of forests after a disturbance and can be seen as an indication of the increase in low-intensity forestry in Europe, where only single trees or crops of trees are taken rather than clear cutting large areas.Therefore, despite the major changes in Europe's forests, the researchers see positive developments. As Cornelius Senf has said, ""In most cases, new, young trees grow up after a loss of the old stand."" However, he goes on to say: ""To understand where forests may be at risk of irreversible damage, we need a baseline as a reference. This is provided by the newly created map.""Professor Rupert Seidl adds: ""The new maps help us to understand how Europe's forests are changing. After all, increasing opening in the canopy pose a risk to the forest, but also other opportunities for new generations of trees that are better adapted to climate change to establish themselves. Among other things, the maps can help to identify areas where regeneration needs to be promoted through targeted planting or where the forests can rejuvenate themselves. In this way, the forest can be made fit for climate change -- a task that, especially in the last two years, has gained in urgency.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers have created a map that shows the extent of Europe's forest canopy openings, revealing that forests have become more open and the frequency of forests being interrupted by open spaces has increased.

The study estimates that humans are now introducing the element three to eight times faster, or possibly even more. The consequences for life both in the water and on land are potentially catastrophic. The findings appear this week in the journal ","Researchers at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory examined ocean conditions 55.6 million years ago, a time known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Before this, the planet was already considerably warmer than it is today, and the soaring COScientists have known about the PETM carbon surge for years, but until now, have been shaky on what caused it. Aside from volcanism, hypotheses have included the sudden dissolution of frozen methane (which contains carbon) from ocean-floor muds, or even a collision with a comet. Researchers have also been uncertain about how much carbon dioxide was present in the air, and thus how much the oceans took in. The new study solidifies both the volcano theory, and the amount of carbon that was released into the air.The research is directly relevant to today, said lead author Laura Haynes, who did the research as a graduate student at Lamont-Doherty. ""We want to understand how the earth system is going to respond to rapid COUp to now, marine studies of the PETM have relied on scant chemical data from the oceans, and assumptions based on a certain degree of guesswork that researchers fed into computer models.The authors of the new study got at the questions more directly. They did this by culturing tiny shelled marine organisms called foraminifera in seawater that they formulated to resemble the highly acidic conditions of the PETM. They recorded how the organisms took up the element boron into their shells during growth. They then compared these data with analyses of boron from fossilized foraminifera in Pacific and Atlantic ocean-floor cores that span the PETM. This allowed them to identify carbon-isotope signatures associated with specific carbon sources. This indicated that volcanoes were the main source -- probably from massive eruptions centered around what is now Iceland, as the North Atlantic ocean opened up, and northern North America and Greenland separated from northern Europe.The researchers say the carbon pulses, which others estimate lasted for at least 4,000 to 5,000 years, added as much as 14.9 quadrillion metric tons of carbon to the oceans -- a two-thirds increase over their previous content. The carbon would have come from COToday, human emissions are causing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to skyrocket, and the oceans are again absorbing much of it. The difference is that we are introducing it much faster than the volcanoes did -- within decades instead of millennia. Atmospheric levels have shot up from about 280 parts per million in the 1700s to about 415 today, and they are on a path to keep rising rapidly. Atmospheric levels would already be much higher if the oceans were not absorbing so much. As they do, rapid acidification is starting to stress marine life.""If you add carbon slowly, living things can adapt. If you do it very fast, that's a really big problem,"" said the study's coauthor Bärbel Hönisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty. She pointed out that even at the much slower pace of the PETM, marine life saw major die-offs. ""The past saw some really dire consequences, and that does not bode well for the future,"" she said.

But what happens when dams and weirs restrict their movement? And are native and alien species similarly affected? Researchers from the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) and the Spanish University of Girona (UdG) have addressed these questions in a recent study.,"River ecosystems are frequently fragmented by dams and weirs. As a result, native fish are often restricted in their movement along the river course and are unable to colonize new habitats. Thus, barriers impede native species from adjusting their distributions in response to the effects of climate change such as changes in water temperature and quality.On the other hand, river fragmentation might also limit the further spread of invasive alien species. Using the Ebro River in Spain as an example, the research team has investigated how habitats of native and alien fish species change under different climate scenarios and how dams mediate habitat accessibility.""The Ebro River is particularly vulnerable and threatened by climate change and species invasions. In addition, the Ebro River is fragmented by over 300 dams and many smaller barriers, which makes it even worse for the native fish species,"" said Emili García-Berthou, Professor at the University of Girona and co-author of the study.By applying a spatial modelling framework, the authors showed that losses of native species and gains of alien species and consequentially most pronounced biodiversity changes are particularly expected in the lower and mid reaches of larger Ebro River tributaries. According to their results, the majority of species are projected to shift their range in upstream direction with alien species such as eastern mosquitofish, wels catfish and common carp showing especially large habitat gains.""The Ebro River system is home to several endemic species that exclusively occur on the Iberian Peninsula. These species are particularly imperilled by barriers that limit movements in response to climate change. Whether dams can effectively prevent the spread of alien species is questionable. In fact, the establishment of alien fishes is often facilitated by the changed flow and habitat conditions that result from damming rivers,"" said IGB researcher Johannes Radinger, lead author of the study.The results clearly show that fish communities in highly fragmented rivers affected by climate change will be particularly affected by biodiversity changes and species loss in the future. ""Effective conservation of fishes should focus on the restoration of habitats and the natural flow regime, improvements of connectivity for native species and the control of alien species, particularly the prevention of further introductions,"" concluded the authors.",Climate,2020.0,"Dams and weirs frequently fragment river ecosystems, restricting the movement of native fish and preventing them from colonizing new habitats.

Urgent action is needed to prevent biodiversity losses and extinctions, particularly in tropical and Mediterranean areas which have some of the most diverse ecological communities on the planet.""The research team analysed data on 47,044 species of animals, plants and fungi at thousands of sites in 91 countries to measure the number of different species living in more disturbed environments such as cities and intensive agricultural areas, or in moderately disturbed or wild spaces. The team also compared data on where species are able to survive against regional climate modelling data to predict responses to climate change.The researchers found substantially lower biodiversity in more disturbed environments, especially in Mediterranean and tropical regions. They also found that among vertebrates, those most sensitive to climate warming are found in tropical forests, tropical grasslands and Mediterranean areas. Species of concern include the eastern gorilla, critically endangered due to habitat loss and climate change in the African tropics, and Hermann's tortoise, a Mediterranean animal currently threatened by habitat loss and likely climate change as well in years to come.Across species in tropical regions, the researchers projected local declines of 10 to 13% in the number of species for each degree of climate warming.Species in areas with less pronounced seasonal changes, particularly in the tropics, were found to be the most vulnerable to climate change. The researchers note that plants and animals that have not adapted to wide ranges of temperatures across seasons are more likely to suffer if temperatures rise. In tropical and Mediterranean regions, many species were found to be already living near the upper temperature limit that they can tolerate.One partial explanation for the findings is that some other biomes (communities of plants and animals occupying a particular habitat) have been heavily influenced by humans for centuries, indicating that the most sensitive species are likely to have already been wiped out.While not tested in the study, the researchers say that tropical species may also be more vulnerable due to smaller range sizes and high concentrations of specialist species, as well as those that mature more slowly and produce fewer offspring.Dr Newbold said: ""We found that areas facing the greatest biodiversity threats from climate change and land use were often the same areas, which is even more concerning as these two pressures can interact to make environments even more inhospitable. For example, heavily modified landscapes often have less canopy cover which would otherwise moderate extreme temperatures.""Dr Newbold is also a co-author of the World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report, published this month, which showed that biodiversity has declined most in the tropics since 1970. He and colleagues argue that coordinated global efforts are needed to turn the tide of biodiversity loss.""Conservation efforts alone will not be enough to save endangered and vulnerable animals and plants. Governments, private companies and consumers will all need to act now to curb climate change and to mitigate land use pressures that destroy habitats,"" he said.Dr Newbold and his study co-authors, UCL master's student Philippa Oppenheimer and PhD candidates Adrienne Etard and Jessica Williams, were supported by the Royal Society.",Climate,2020.0,"New research from the University College London (UCL) has found that global biodiversity losses may be worse than previously predicted, with tropical and Mediterranean areas most at risk.

Environmental migration is most pronounced in middle-income and agricultural countries but weaker in low-income countries, where populations often lack resources needed for migration.

""In both low and high income countries environmental impacts on migration are weaker -- presumably because either people are too poor to leave and become basically trapped, or, in wealthy countries, have enough financial means to absorb the consequences. It is mainly in regions with middle incomes and a dependency on agriculture that we see strong effects.""The meta-study, which analyzed 30 previously published studies on the topic, reveals a number of fascinating patterns. It shows, for example, that impacts on migration vary by types of environmental hazards and that different hazards can re-inforce each other. ""While changing temperatures in a region are found to have the strongest impact on migration, also rapid-onset disasters and changing rainfall variability and anomalies can play a role. Especially smallholder farmers rely on steady climatic conditions and suffer from changes and shocks as they have insufficient capacities to adapt,"" says co-author Raya Muttarak from the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis and the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, VID/ÖAW, University of Vienna).The researchers emphasize that there is no automatism at play -- environmental migration always depends on a number of economic and sociopolitical factors. The narrative of climate refugees pushing towards Europe or the US may be too simplistic. For instance, the researchers found compelling evidence that environmental changes in vulnerable countries predominantly lead to internal migration or migration to other low- and middle-income countries, rather than cross-border migration to high-income countries. Affected populations often migrate to places within their own region and eventually return to their homes within a relatively short period of time.The findings, published in the latest issue of Given the expected rise of the global average temperature the researchers believe that the topic of environmental migration will become more important in the future.

Diptera are more dominant towards the north, while the species richness of Lepidoptera increase towards the south.""We have found that the proportion of parasitoids preying on warmth-loving butterflies is especially in areas where summer temperatures in particular have risen in recent decades. By contrast, winter-time warming is reflected in a large representation of parasitoid species feeding on Diptera,"" says Kankaanpää.""Beyond their host species, parasitoids can also be classified into two other groups based on how they use their host. Koinobionts are the true masters of the parasitic lifestyle and manipulate their host with surgical precision. Females lay their eggs in the host's egg or larva, where the parasitoid larva then waits patiently until the host has grown larger. To do this, the koinobiont must skillfully manipulate the host's immune defense to survive. The second group, idiobionts, are more reminiscent of classic predators. The larvae of idiobionts start eating the host as soon as they hatch,"" says Kankaanpää.""These different strategies are directly reflected in the sensitivity of the two groups to climatic conditions. Koinobionts can wait until the host has retreated to sheltered conditions to hibernate before killing it. Thus, they get protection from the worst frosts. Idiobionts lack this advantage, and often paralyze the host where found, having to then live in it at the mercy of the weather.""""In our project, we have harnessed the ratio between parasitoids of Lepidoptera and Diptera, and between koinobionts and idiobionts, into a sensitive barometer of the effects of climate change, Kankaanpää says. To this end, we have adopted a number of effective solutions. A common approach to predicting the effects of climate change is to compare contemporary communities of organisms in different climates. We then assume that communities in cold areas will eventually begin to resemble their current counterparts in warmer regions as the climate warms. The time dimension of change is thus replaced by distance, in what is called a space for time substitution. Now, however, we can already compare areas where the climate has changed in different ways. This is especially true in the Arctic, where change, and at the same time regional disparities, are large,"" says Kankaanpää.Professor Tomas Roslin has been the supervisor of Tuomas Kankaanpää and is equally enthusiastic about new ways of research -- and also points out another advance.""For studies like this, we are also cooperating in a new way. This allows us to ask questions that would otherwise be too expensive, difficult and logistically challenging to address. If one research team was to send its members around the world, it would cost hundreds of thousands of euros. But by collaborating with other scientists across the Arctic and asking them for a few working days, everyone can provide their piece of the bigger puzzle, as collected using uniform methods. This is how we put together the full picture with realistic resources. And I am convinced that this kind of collaboration will pave the way for new breakthroughs,"" Roslin says.With their clever and slightly macabre lifestyles, parasitoids have inspired us humans as well. The monsters in the Alien movies are classical parasitoids which, just like some parasitic flies, leave their eggs waiting for a passing host. Due to their cruel appearance, parasitoid wasps are often despised. But at the same time, we have the parasitoids to thank for our crops and gardens. Parasitoids are among the main enemies of herbivorous insects, and without them much of the world's greenery could disappear into smaller mouths. In the Arctic, the parasitoids are, in fact, the most numerous and species-rich predators.",Climate,2020.0,"Arctic insect communities are already being affected by climate change, with a higher proportion of cold-sensitive predators found in areas where summers are rapidly warming, according to research by teams from six countries. The study, which focused on parasitoid wasps and flies, found that different parasitoid species use different hosts, with Lepidoptera and Diptera the largest in the Arctic. The researchers used the ratios between parasitoids adhering to different lifestyles to create a barometer of the effects of climate change. The study also demonstrated the benefits of cross-border collaboration in research, according to Professor Tomas Roslin from the University of Helsinki",,

When flowers abound, the plants have to compete for pollinators. Researchers at the University of Helsinki reveal that higher temperatures cause the flowering periods of different plant species to pile up in time. As a consequence, climate change may affect the competitive relationships of plants.","The most attractive plant species steal the majority of pollinators, making other plants flowering at the same time suffer from poorer pollination.""Most flowering plants are dependent on the pollination services provided by insects. Thus, plants need to time their flowering to periods of maximal pollinator abundances. On the other hand, plant species compete with each other for pollination. Thus, plant species flowering at the same time can affect each other's pollination success. Temperature is one of the most important environmental determinants of the onset of flowering. As the climate warms, plant species change their flowering periods, thereby changing their competition for pollinators,"" explains Mikko Tiusanen, researcher at the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Helsinki, and lead scientist behind the study.""We have been studying the relationship between plants and pollinators in North East Greenland, where the climate is warming twice as fast as the global average. The most common flowering plant in this region is Avens, a widespread and abundant flowering species. The shape of an Avens' flower is an open, white cup of nectar, irresistibly attractive to any pollinators around. In our comparisons, Avens was found to attract many more visitors than other plant species. When in bloom, it thus monopolizes insect pollination services at the expense of other plants in flower,"" says Tiusanen.By studying the timing of flowering of different plant species under different environmental conditions, the researchers found that higher temperatures caused the flowering periods of different plant species to contract. In particular, the flowering of the Moss Campion advanced relative to the flowering of Avens. This affects the competition between the two species, since the flowering of Avens is directly reflected in how many insects carry Campion pollen: with more Avens in bloom, fewer insects carried the pollen of the Campion.Global warming may thus affect competition between plant species for pollination services, thereby changing interactions between species. For example, overlap in flowering between a plant species and a more attractive competitor reduces pollination and may impair the species' chances of survival in the long run. This is likely to be a particular threat to rare plant species, as well as to flower species less attractive to insects, scientists speculate.""To me, the Arctic represents a planetary research laboratory for studies of climate change,"" says Tomas Roslin, director of the research group spanning the University of Helsinki and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). ""The climate of this region is now changing twice as fast as the global average. What this means is that what happens in the Arctic today may later occur in the rest of the world. At the same time, relatively low species richness in the Arctic allows us to resolve their interactions in great detail. But scientific reasons are only half the arctic appeal. Northeast Greenland is one of the most beautiful areas in the world, and at the same time one of the largest uninhabited areas in the world. When studying insects here, you may even run into a polar bear. Such a combination keeps the researchers alert and awake.""",Climate,2020.0,"Global warming is causing flowering periods of different plant species to contract, which is affecting competition between plant species for pollination services.

They identified areas totaling more than 7 million square kilometers -- roughly the size of Russia -- with conditions such that forests would regrow and thrive on their own if agricultural pressure were removed.Atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased 40% since the dawn of the industrial age, contributing heavily to a warming planet. According to the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration, the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in 2018 was 407.4 parts per million, higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over millions of years. That same carbon is now being returned to the atmosphere in a matter of hundreds of years because fossil fuels are being burned for energy,The annual rate of increase in atmospheric COUnlike oxygen or nitrogen, which account for most of the atmosphere, greenhouse gases absorb heat and release it gradually over time. Absent those greenhouse gases, the planet's average annual temperature would be below freezing rather than around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, but too-high levels of greenhouse gases cause the Earth's energy budget to become unbalanced.The largest potential for climate-benefiting forest regrowth is in comparatively wealthy nations. In those countries, cutbacks in meat and dairy production would bring relatively mild impacts on food security, the researchers say, while substantially assisting in capping climate change at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial age levels as called for in the 2016 Paris Agreement.A majority of climate scientists agree that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees would maintain substantial proportions of ecosystems while also benefiting human health and economies.""We can think of shifting our eating habits toward land-friendly diets as a supplement to developing green energy, rather than a substitute,"" Hayek said. ""Restoring native forests could buy some much-needed time for countries to transition their energy grids to renewable, fossil-free infrastructure.""Hayek, Ripple and their collaborators -- Helen Harwatt of Harvard and Nathaniel Mueller of Colorado State -- emphasize that their findings are meant to help local officials seeking to come up with plans to mitigate climate change. The scientists acknowledge that animal-based agriculture is economically and culturally important in many areas around the globe.""While the potential for restoring ecosystems is substantial, extensive animal agriculture is culturally and economically important in many regions around the world,"" Mueller said. ""Ultimately, our findings can help target places where restoring ecosystems and halting ongoing deforestation would have the largest carbon benefits.""Reducing meat production would also aid water quality and quantity, wildlife habitat and biodiversity, Ripple says, including fostering the ecosystem health that helps thwart pandemic diseases originating from animals as COVID-19 is believed to have done.""Intact, functioning ecosystems and preserved wildlife habitat help make the risk of pandemics smaller,"" Ripple said. ""Our research shows that with diet change, we have an opportunity to give large areas back to nature and wildlife with relatively minimal impacts on food security. Ecosystem restoration and reduced livestock populations could reduce zoonotic disease transmission from wildlife to chickens or pigs and ultimately to people.""",Climate,2020.0,"Shifting to plant-based diets could help restore forests and mitigate climate change, according to research by scientists at Oregon State University, New York University, Harvard and Colorado State.

The team identified areas totalling more than 7 million square kilometres where forests could regrow if animal agriculture was reduced. Restoring ecosystems could also help to reduce the risk of pandemics, as intact habitats make transmission of diseases from wildlife to livestock and people less likely.",,

The record reveals four distinctive climate states, which the researchers dubbed Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, and Icehouse.","These major climate states persisted for millions and sometimes tens of millions of years, and within each one the climate shows rhythmic variations corresponding to changes in Earth's orbit around the sun. But each climate state has a distinctive response to orbital variations, which drive relatively small changes in global temperatures compared with the dramatic shifts between different climate states.The new findings, published September 10 in ""We've known for a long time that the glacial-interglacial cycles are paced by changes in Earth's orbit, which alter the amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface, and astronomers have been computing these orbital variations back in time,"" explained coauthor James Zachos, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and Ida Benson Lynn Professor of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz.""As we reconstructed past climates, we could see long-term coarse changes quite well. We also knew there should be finer-scale rhythmic variability due to orbital variations, but for a long time it was considered impossible to recover that signal,"" Zachos said. ""Now that we have succeeded in capturing the natural climate variability, we can see that the projected anthropogenic warming will be much greater than that.""For the past 3 million years, Earth's climate has been in an Icehouse state characterized by alternating glacial and interglacial periods. Modern humans evolved during this time, but greenhouse gas emissions and other human activities are now driving the planet toward the Warmhouse and Hothouse climate states not seen since the Eocene epoch, which ended about 34 million years ago. During the early Eocene, there were no polar ice caps, and average global temperatures were 9 to 14 degrees Celsius higher than today.""The IPCC projections for 2300 in the 'business-as-usual' scenario will potentially bring global temperature to a level the planet has not seen in 50 million years,"" Zachos said.Critical to compiling the new climate record was getting high-quality sediment cores from deep ocean basins through the international Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, later the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, IODP, succeeded in 2013 by the International Ocean Discovery Program). Signatures of past climates are recorded in the shells of microscopic plankton (called foraminifera) preserved in the seafloor sediments. After analyzing the sediment cores, researchers then had to develop an ""astrochronology"" by matching the climate variations recorded in sediment layers with variations in Earth's orbit (known as Milankovitch cycles).""The community figured out how to extend this strategy to older time intervals in the mid-1990s,"" said Zachos, who led a study published in 2001 in ""That changed everything, because if we could do that, we knew we could go all the way back to maybe 66 million years ago and put these transient events and major transitions in Earth's climate in the context of orbital-scale variations,"" he said.Zachos has collaborated for years with lead author Thomas Westerhold at the University of Bremen Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (MARUM) in Germany, which houses a vast repository of sediment cores. The Bremen lab along with Zachos's group at UCSC generated much of the new data for the older part of the record.Westerhold oversaw a critical step, splicing together overlapping segments of the climate record obtained from sediment cores from different parts of the world. ""It's a tedious process to assemble this long megasplice of climate records, and we also wanted to replicate the records with separate sediment cores to verify the signals, so this was a big effort of the international community working together,"" Zachos said.Now that they have compiled a continuous, astronomically dated climate record of the past 66 million years, the researchers can see that the climate's response to orbital variations depends on factors such as greenhouse gas levels and the extent of polar ice sheets.""In an extreme greenhouse world with no ice, there won't be any feedbacks involving the ice sheets, and that changes the dynamics of the climate,"" Zachos explained.Most of the major climate transitions in the past 66 million years have been associated with changes in greenhouse gas levels. Zachos has done extensive research on the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), for example, showing that this episode of rapid global warming, which drove the climate into a Hothouse state, was associated with a massive release of carbon into the atmosphere. Similarly, in the late Eocene, as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were dropping, ice sheets began to form in Antarctica and the climate transitioned to a Coolhouse state.""The climate can become unstable when it's nearing one of these transitions, and we see more deterministic responses to orbital forcing, so that's something we would like to better understand,"" Zachos said.The new climate record provides a valuable framework for many areas of research, he added. It is not only useful for testing climate models, but also for geophysicists studying different aspects of Earth dynamics and paleontologists studying how changing environments drive the evolution of species.Coauthors Steven Bohaty, now at the University of Southampton, and Kate Littler, now at the University of Exeter, both worked with Zachos at UC Santa Cruz.

""By investing in science, you can narrow the range of uncertainty and improve a social cost-benefit assessment.""Better understanding of the ocean's carbon sequestration capacity will lead to more accurate climate models, providing policymakers with the information they need to establish emissions targets and make plans for a changing climate, Jin adds.With co-authors Porter Hoagland and Ken Buesseler, Jin builds a case for a 20-year scientific research program to measure and model the ocean's biological carbon pump, the process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is transported to the deep ocean through the marine food web.The biological carbon pump is fueled by tiny plant-like organisms floating on the ocean surface called phytoplankton, which consume carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis. When the phytoplankton die or are eaten by larger organisms, the carbon-rich fragments and fecal matter sink deeper into the ocean, where they are eaten by other creatures or buried in seafloor sediments, which helps decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide and thus reduces global climate change.Rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, a result of human activity such as burning fossil fuels, warms the planet by trapping heat from the sun and also dissolves into seawater, lowering the pH of the ocean, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification. A warmer, more acidic ocean could weaken the carbon pump, causing atmospheric temperatures to rise -- or it could get stronger, with the opposite effect.""When we try to predict what the world is going to look like, there's great uncertainty,"" says Buesseler, a WHOI marine chemist. ""Not only do we not know how big this pump is, we don't know whether it will remove more or less carbon dioxide in the future. We need to make progress to better understand where we're headed, because the climate affects all of humanity.""Buesseler added that efforts like WHOI's Ocean Twilight Zone initiative and NASA's EXport Processes in the global Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) program are making important strides in understanding the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle, but this research needs to be vastly scaled up in order to develop predictive models such as those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Current IPCC models do not account for change in the ocean's ability to take up carbon, which Buesseler said affects their accuracy.Though the paper's assessment doesn't account for the cost of a global research program, Buesseler said that investment would be a small fraction of the $500 billion expected benefit. The authors warn that this savings could also be viewed as a cost to society if the research does not lead to policy decisions that mitigate the effects of climate change.""Just like a weather forecast that helps you decide whether or not to bring an umbrella, you use your knowledge and experience to make a decision based on science,"" Jin says.

Scientists deduce historical climatic conditions for the past hundreds of years from the width of the annual growth rings of trees.

Main reason for this approach was the existing long observation series dating back to the middle of the 18th century to compare with the tree ring data. In addition, there are archives that accurately recorded the beginning of grape and grain harvests and even go back to the 14th century. These records, as well as the width of tree rings, allow temperature reconstructions. A warm summer is indicated by a wide tree ring and an early start of the harvest, a cold summer by a narrow tree ring and a late start of the harvest. The trees studied are those from altitudes where temperature has a strong influence on growth and where there is enough water for growth even in warm years.""It turned out that in the tree ring data the climatic fluctuations are exaggerated.

Researchers from the European Research Infrastructure Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), including researchers from the University of Göttingen, are showing what effects this had and what lessons can be learned. The results of 16 studies that are currently underway have been published as a special issue in the journal ","The interdisciplinary teams shed light on different aspects of this research. Among many findings, they found that the plants initially benefited from the warm and sunny conditions in spring, but had too little water available for their roots when the summer heatwave started. As a result, grasslands began to dry up and numerous arable areas recorded the lowest yields for decades. The forests protected themselves by greatly reducing their evaporation for several weeks, but this then led to a sharp drop in carbon dioxide uptake. Such effects were observed simultaneously -- all the way from Switzerland to the Netherlands and Germany, and from the Czech Republic to Sweden and Finland.The Bioclimatology Group of the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology at the University of Göttingen contributes to ICOS with a meteorological station in the Hainich National Park. For the last 20 years every 30 minutes, the station has measured the carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour exchange between forest and atmosphere. Comparing the data across Europe shows that the area under investigation is one of those most affected by the 2018 drought. ""In 2018, the CO2 uptake calculated over the whole year was about 30 percent lower than the average of the past 20 years,"" says Head of the Group Professor Alexander Knohl.

""In the past 20 years, this has never happened before.""The measurements from the meteorological station in the Hainich National Park are of great international scientific importance for two reasons: it is one of the world's longest time series for such continuous measurements; and it is one of the oldest unmanaged forests in which such measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapour exchange takes place.ICOS is a European research infrastructure for measuring carbon dioxide fluxes between land, ocean and atmosphere.

But many ambitious climate action plans foresee the use of climate engineering technologies whose risks are insufficiently understood. In a new publication, researchers from the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam, Germany, describe how evolving modelling practices are trending towards ""best-case"" projections. They warn that over-optimistic expectations of climate engineering may reinforce the inertia with which industry and politics have been addressing decarbonisation. In order to forestall this trend, they recommend more stakeholder input and clearer communication of the premises and limitations of model results.","The focus of the paper lies on the models underpinning the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports -- the first port-of-call for mapping combinations of technologies, alternative pathways of deployment, and climatic impacts. The authors show how modelling of solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal technologies tends toward ""best-case"" projections. According to their analysis, the poorly substantiated promises delivered by these projections influence research, policy, and industry planning in the near term and may already be entrenching carbon infrastructures. In the case of certain kinds of carbon dioxide removal, for example, the prospect of future carbon capture is sometimes wrongly seen as a substitute for present mitigation.The researchers outline ways in which this trend can be forestalled. They propose mechanisms for increasing stakeholder input and strengthening political realism in modelling. ""The portrayal of modelling as explorative, technically focused mappings for supporting decision making is simplistic. Modellers have to choose parameters and design scenarios. Their choices cannot be 'neutral' -- scenarios reflect hidden judgments and create benchmarks for further conversation, whether in assessment, or in technology and policy development,"" says co-author Sean Low. For that reason, there needs to be more transparency about the ways in which models are constructed, perceived, and applied. Efforts to expand modelling ""reality checks"" with technology experts, social scientists, and a wide range of users are a pragmatic first step.The scientific community must also be wary of the selective use of projections. Projections offer schemes that are stylised, optimised, and deceptively simple. By abstracting from possible technical failures and messy politics, they can create a false sense of certainty regarding the feasibility of a particular course of action. But it would be wrong to use them as alternatives to existing climate action plans or instruction manuals. Since modelling projections can offer only partial depictions of systemic risk, it is problematic if political and industry interests co-opt a stylised version for pre-existing agendas and gloss over the models' fine print.The authors emphasise the need for policy guardrails: ""In climate governance the devil really does lie in the details. The inertia of the carbon economy requires that significant efforts are made to prevent particular and short-term interests undermining policy integrity,"" says co-author Matthias Honegger. In addition to more transparent modelling, a lot of careful policy development and governance work is needed to ensure that solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal technologies play a constructive role in future climate policy.",Climate,2020.0,"The models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tend to present overly optimistic projections for solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal technologies, according to a new paper.

According to the new study, this increase is driven almost exclusively by human impact.The study further shows that even prehistoric humans already had a significant destructive impact on biodiversity -- one that was even more destructive than the largest climatic changes of Earth's recent history, such as the last ice age.""We find essentially no evidence for climate-driven extinctions during the past 126,000 years Instead, we find that human impact explains 96% of all mammal extinctions during that time,"" asserts Daniele Silvestro, one of the researchers.This is at odds with views of some scholars, who believe that strong climatic changes were the main driving force behind most pre-historic mammal extinctions. Rather, the new findings suggest that in the past mammal species were resilient, even to extreme fluctuations in climate.""However, current climate change, together with fragmented habitats, poaching, and other human-related threats pose a large risk for many species,"" says Daniele Silvestro.The researcher's conclusions are based on a large data set of fossils. They compiled and analyzed data of 351 mammal species that have gone extinct since the beginning of the Late Pleistocene era. Among many others, these included iconic species such as mammoths, sabre tooth tigers, and giant ground sloths. Fossil data provided by the Zoological Society of London were an important contribution to the study.""These extinctions did not happen continuously and at constant pace. Instead, bursts of extinctions are detected across different continents at times when humans first reached them. More recently, the magnitude of human driven extinctions has picked up the pace again, this time on a global scale,"" says Tobias Andermann from the University of Gothenburg.The current extinction rate of mammals is likely the largest extinction event since the end of the dinosaur era, according to the researchers.

This is if current trends in human behavior and biodiversity loss continue.""Despite these grim projections, the trend can still be changed. We can save hundreds if not thousands of species from extinction with more targeted and efficient conservation strategies.

Huge amounts of greenhouse gases are warming the planet and altering the climate. Heat waves are harsher. Droughts are longer. And some diseases and pests are stronger than ever.,"All of that is bad news for many of Earth's inhabitants. But crops are especially vulnerable. We've bred them to depend on us, and they can succumb to many threats that are likely to get worse in the next century. All as we need more food to feed a growing population.An international group of researchers set out to test how we can help our crops adapt in the coming decades. Their idea is to use wild crop relatives.These cousins of domestic crops look like weeds and you have probably walked past them when hiking on mountain trails. You may have even seen them in the cracks of pavement in the cities. They have lived in harsh climates without any human help since the dawn of time.Scientists hope that using crop wild relatives in breeding programs can add resilience to our domestic crops while keeping them delicious.""Crop wild relatives have been selected by nature over millennia to withstand the very climatic stresses that we are trying to address, and hence present a new hope,"" says Filippo Bassi. Bassi is a scientist in Morocco at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA).But it can be risky to change how breeders work. ""Before making the final decision to shift investments from normal breeding to the use of crop wild relatives, it is critical to make sure that there is a real advantage in doing so,"" Bassi says.To test this idea, Bassi's international team of scientists, coming from Africa, Europe, Asia and South America, focused on durum wheat.The team gathered 60 unique varieties of wheat to expose to a battery of harsh tests. These included fungal diseases, drought and high temperatures. One-third of the wheat lines the team used were developed by combining wild relatives of wheat with strong, commercial varieties.These wild relative-derived varieties of wheat were robust compared to more conventional varieties. About a third of wild relative varieties were resistant to the fungal disease Septoria, compared to just a tenth of the others. But conventional wheat varieties were more resistant to other diseases, like leaf rust, that have been the focus of past breeding programs.Where the wild relative wheat varieties really shone was under drought and heat stress. During drought, the wild relative lines had larger grains, a critical adaptation and market trait for this crop. And, when the nutrient nitrogen was in short supply, the wild-derived lines produced a higher yield than the other wheat varieties.""In the case of temperature, the crop wild relative presented a clear advantage with a yield increase of 42 percent under heat stress,"" says Bassi. ""Yield losses to heat can be drastic, and the use of crop wild relatives to breed new varieties appears to be a very strategic approach to address this climatic challenge.""But resilience isn't the whole story. We depend on crops to make food. And crops are different from their wild cousins in large part because humans have selected crops over many centuries to adapt to their needs, including a preference for making delicious foods.That is why Bassi's team also looked at the usefulness of the 60 wheat varieties for making pasta. Here, the wild-derived wheat lines were the least suitable for pasta making. ""That's a disappointment,"" says Bassi. ""But not a deal breaker.""""This does not prove that the use of crop wild relatives will inevitably result in poor industrial quality,"" says Bassi. ""But rather that it is important for breeders to be aware of this risk and develop breeding strategies that address this issue.""Overall, durum wheat's wild relatives appeared useful. When crossed to elite commercial varieties, they provided increased resistance to heat, drought and some diseases. These are precisely the threats facing not just durum wheat, but most major crops in a warming world. That's good news for plant breeders -- and the public.""The crop wild relatives showed great promise in terms of climate change adaptation,"" says Bassi. ""I hope the public will be re-assured that breeders are testing all possible opportunities to prepare agriculture for climate challenges.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America have studied the use of wild crop relatives to help crops adapt to the challenges of climate change.

Data from two research missions, using aircraft and ship, are helping scientists to understand the contribution this huge and remote glacier is likely to make to future global sea level rise.","Researchers from UK and US International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), collected data from the glacier and adjoining Dotson and Crosson ice shelves during January-March 2019. While one team collected airborne data flying over the glacier and ice shelf in a British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter aircraft, the other mapped the sea floor at the ice front from the US Antarctic Program icebreaker RV Nathaniel B Palmer.Publishing this month (9 September) in the journal Over the past 30 years, the overall rate of ice loss from Thwaites and its neighbouring glaciers has increased more than 5-fold. Already, ice draining from Thwaites into the Amundsen Sea accounts for about four percent of global sea-level rise. A run-away collapse of the glacier could lead to a significant increase in sea levels of around 65 cm (25 inches) and scientists want to find out how quickly this could happen.Lead author Dr Tom Jordan, an aero-geophysicist at British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who led the airborne survey, says:""It was fantastic to be able to map the channels and cavity system hidden beneath the ice shelf; they are deeper than expected -- some are more than 800 metres deep. They form the critical link between the ocean and the glacier.""The offshore channels, along with the adjacent cavity system, are very likely to be the route by which warm ocean water passes underneath the ice shelf up to the grounding line, where the ice meets the bed.""Dave Porter at LDEO Columbia University, who flew over Thwaites Glacier for the airborne survey, says:""Flying over the recently-collapsed ice tongue and being able to see first-hand the changes occurring at Thwaites Glacier was both awe inspiring and disconcerting, but also gratifying to know the airborne data we were collecting would help reveal the hidden structures below.""Exceptional sea-ice break up in early 2019 enabled the team on the RV Nathaniel B Palmer to survey over 2000 square kilometres of sea floor at the glacier's ice front. The area surveyed had previously been hidden beneath part of the floating ice shelf extending from Thwaites Glacier, which broke off in 2002, and in most subsequent years the area was inaccessible due to thick sea-ice cover. The team's findings reveal the sea floor is generally deeper and has more deep channels leading towards the grounding line under the ice shelf than was previously thought.Lead author, Dr Kelly Hogan, is a marine geophysicist at BAS. She was part of the team surveying the seabed. She says:""We found the coastal sea floor, which is incredibly rugged, is a really good analogue for the bed beneath the present-day Thwaites Glacier both in terms of its shape and rock type. By examining retreat patterns over this sea-floor terrain we will be able to help numerical modellers and glaciologists in their quest to predict future retreat.""This research has filled a critical data gap. Together the new coastal sea floor maps and the cavity maps track the deep channels for over 100 km to where the glacier sits on the bed. For the first time we have a clear view of the pathways along which warm water can reach the underside of the glacier, causing it to melt and contribute to global sea-level rise.""Ice shelf -- is a large floating platform of ice that forms where a glacier or ice sheet flows down to a coastline and onto the ocean surface.

It is an ancestor of today's amphibians and has been considered the most puzzling representative of the Metoposauridae. Paleontologists from the universities of Bonn (Germany) and Opole (Poland) examined the fossil's bone tissue and compared it with other representatives of the family also dating from the Triassic. They discovered phases of slower and faster growth in the bone, which apparently depended on the climate. The results have now been published in the journal ","Temnospondyli belong to the ancestors of today's amphibians. This group of animals became extinct about 120 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous. The Temnospondyli also include the Metoposauridae, a fossil group that lived exclusively in the Late Triassic about 225 million years ago. Remains of these ancestors are present on almost every continent. In Europe, they are found mainly in Poland, Portugal and also in southern Germany.Panthasaurus maleriensis, the most puzzling representative of the Metoposauridae to date, lived in what is now India, near the town of Boyapally. ""Until now, there were hardly any investigation opportunities because the fossils were very difficult to access,"" explains Elzbieta Teschner from the University of Opole, who is working on her doctorate in paleontology in the research group of Prof. Dr. Martin Sander at the University of Bonn. Researchers from the Universities of Bonn and Opole, together with colleagues from the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata (India), have now examined the tissue of fossil bones of a metoposaur from the Southern Hemisphere for the first time. The amphibian, which resembled a crocodile, could grow up to three meters in length.""The investigated taxon is called Panthasaurus maleriensis and was found in the Maleri Formation in Central India,"" notes Teschner with regard to the name. So far, the fossil has only been examined morphologically on the basis of its external shape. ""Histology as the study of tissues, on the other hand, provides us with a valuable insight into the bone interior,"" says Dr. Dorota Konietzko-Meier from the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn. The histological findings can be used to draw conclusions about age, habitat and even climate during the animal's lifetime.The histological examinations revealed that the young animals had very rapid bone growth and that this growth decreased with age. The Indian site where the bones were found provides evidence of both young and adult animals, in contrast to Krasiejów (south-western Poland), where only young animals were found. Geological and geochemical data show that the Late Triassic consisted of alternating dry and rainy periods, as in the present monsoon climate of India. ""This sequence is also reflected in the material examined,"" says Teschner. ""There are phases of rapid growth, known as zones, and a slowdown, known as annulus."" Normally, one can still observe stagnation lines in the bones, which develop during unfavorable phases of life, for example during very hot or very cold seasons.In Panthasaurus maleriensis, however, growth never comes to a complete cessation. In comparison: the Polish Metoposaurus krasiejowensis shows the same alternation of zones and annuli in one life cycle and no stagnation lines, whereas the Moroccan representative of the metoposaurs Dutuitosaurus ouazzoui shows stagnation lines -- that is, a complete stop in growth -- in each life cycle.The different growth phases in the bones allow for a comparison of climatic conditions. This means that the climate in the Late Triassic would have been milder in Central India than in Morocco, but not as mild as in the area that today belongs to Poland.

In addition to storm surge, factors behind extreme sea level variability also include mean sea level and low frequency tides.Coastal flood risk assessments often omit the role of extreme sea level variations, ignoring that flood risk is higher in some periods than others, and instead focus on long-term sea level rise, says Thomas Wahl, study co-author and an assistant professor in UCF's Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering.""Knowing how the extreme sea level variations we are investigating modulate the potential losses can help better plan and adapt to mitigate these impacts,"" he says.To develop the models, the researchers linked large-scale climate variability events, such as El Niño, to variability in storm surge activity.

This international study further calls into question predictions that greater tree growth means greater carbon storage in forests in the long term.","Currently, forests absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide (COMost earth system models predict that this growth stimulation will continue to cause a net carbon uptake of forests this century.

The researchers examined more than 200 thousand tree-ring records from 82 tree species from sites across the globe.It confirms that accelerated growth results in shorter tree lifespans, and that growth-lifespan trade-offs are indeed near universal, occurring across almost all tree species and climates. This suggests that increases in forest carbon stocks may be short lived.Lead author of the study, Dr Roel Brienen from the School of Geography at Leeds, said: ""While it has been known for a long time that fast-growing trees live shorter, so far this was only shown for a few species and at a few sites.""We started a global analysis and were surprised to find that these trade-offs are incredibly common. It occurred in almost all species we looked at, including tropical trees.""Our modelling results suggest there is likely to be a time lag before we see the worst of the potential loss of carbon stocks from increases in tree mortality. They estimate that global increases in tree death don't kick in until after sites show accelerated growth.""This is consistent with observations of increased tree death trends across the globe. For example, previous Leeds research has shown long-term increases in tree mortality rates lagging behind tree growth increases in the Amazon forest.""Co-author Prof Manuel Gloor, also from the School of Geography, said: ""Earth system models often do not, or cannot by design, take into account this negative feedback, and model projections of the global forest carbon sink persistence are thus likely inaccurate and too optimistic. Our findings imply that a much reduced future forest carbon sink further increases the urgency to curb greenhouse emissions.""The trade-off may be due to environmental variables affecting tree growth and lifespan. For example, co-author, Dr Alfredo Di Filippo from Tuscia University, Italy previously reported that lifespan of beech trees in the Northern Hemisphere decreases by roughly 30 years for each degree of warming.The current analysis confirms that, across biomes, reductions in lifespan are not due directly to temperature per se, but are a result of faster growth at warmer temperatures.Their findings suggests that a prominent cause of the widespread occurrence of a growth lifespan trade-off is that chances of dying increase dramatically as trees reach their maximum potential tree size.Nonetheless, other factors may still play a role as well. For example, trees that grow fast may invest less in defences against diseases or insect attacks, and may make wood of lower density or with water transport systems more vulnerable to drought.Study co-author Dr Steve Voelker, from the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology, Syracuse, New York, said: ""Our findings, very much like the story of the tortoise and the hare, indicate that there are traits within the fastest growing trees that make them vulnerable, whereas slower growing trees have traits that allow them to persist.""Our society has benefitted in recent decades from the ability of forests to increasingly store carbon and reduce the rate at which CO",Climate,2020.0,"A new study led by the University of Leeds has found that accelerated growth in trees results in shorter tree lifespans, potentially reducing the ability of forests to absorb carbon dioxide.

However, due to climate change, the number of days above 85 degrees between November and April is projected to increase by up to 150% by the end of the century.These changes are enough to prevent many from patronizing the area's famous outdoor attractions and events such as the annual Coachella Valley Music Festival, according to the study published this week in the journal Many businesses in the Palm Springs area already close due to lack of customers during the hot summer months, when daytime high temperatures average up to 108 degrees in July and August. Employment follows these patterns, with regional employment declining by 7.2 percent between April and October in 2017.The researchers modeled two different future climate scenarios -- one in which heat-trapping gases are significantly reduced, resulting in slowed warming, and one in which emissions are not mitigated at all.""The two scenarios differed a little by mid-century, but were very different by 2100,"" said Francesca Hopkins, assistant professor of climate change and sustainability. ""In both cases we saw big declines in the number of days suitable for snowbirds, but this was much more pronounced in the scenario with no emissions reductions.""In order to assess future effects of increased heat, the researchers analyzed two key components of the local tourism industry in addition to the winter weather: the number of visitors to The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens, a popular outdoor zoo, and the likelihood of extreme heat at the Coachella music festival.The Living Desert, established 50 years ago, is a nonprofit zoo visited by more than 510,000 people last year. The research team found that it stands to lose up to $1.44 million annually in tourism in today's dollars with 18 percent fewer visitors at the end of the century.Similarly, heat is also projected to impact the annual Coachella music festival, which began in 1999, and attracts roughly 250,000 concertgoers. The researchers did not assume that increased heat will necessarily affect attendance. However, they did find that probability of attendee exposure to extreme heat -- if it continues to be held in April -- could increase six-fold by end of century if climate change goes unmitigated.""Though other studies have focused on the impact that climate change will have on cold winter destinations popular for sports like skiing, this is one of the first to focus on a warm winter destination, and its impact on such a specific region,"" Hopkins said.Places like the Coachella Valley are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they cannot shift snowbird season to cooler times of year, since those don't exist, Hopkins explained.Cindy Yañez, a UCR physics graduate and first author of the study, was born in the Coachella Valley, and has lived there most of her life. Many people in the area have jobs that require them to work outdoors, either in agriculture or tourism. She wonders whether there will be a climate breaking point that might cause locals like these to move away.""Weather is a resource that draws in money just like other resources do. If that gets redistributed it could have severe impacts on peoples' lives both physically and economically,"" Yañez said. ""I am hoping this research will start a conversation in the community. We still have time to avoid the worst of these predictions if we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions today.""",Climate,2020.0,"Climate change is expected to significantly impact the tourism industry in Palm Springs, a popular winter destination for ""snowbirds"" escaping freezing temperatures.

Until now it wasn't clear if people retreated elsewhere each winter to avoid the intense cold.Dr Alexander Pryor, from the University of Exeter, who led the study, said: ""Our research shows the cold harsh winter climates of the last ice age were no barrier to human activity in the area. Hunters made very specific choices about where and when to kill their prey.""Inhabitants of Kraków Spadzista around 27,500 years ago killed and butchered large numbers of woolly mammoths and arctic foxes at the site. For the first time, the research team were able to reconstruct details of how the foxes were moving around in the landscape before they died, and also what time of the year they died, through analysing the internal chemistry and growth structures of their tooth enamel and roots.The analysis of teeth from four of the 29 hunted foxes show each was born and grew up in a different location, and had migrated either tens or hundreds of kilometres to the region before being killed by hunters -- by snares, deadfalls or other trapping methods -- for both their thick warm furs as well as meat and fat for food. The carcasses were brought back to the site to be skinned and butchered.Analysis of the dental cementum of at least 10 fox individuals demonstrate that the majority were killed between late winter and late spring, most likely in late winter. The foxes ranged in age, from sub-adult to very old.The study, published in the Around 2,400 arctic fox bones were found about 30m south of a huge concentration of bones from more than 100 individual woolly mammoths that dominate the site, in an area used for the production of lithic tools and the processing of smaller prey animals.The study suggests the Arctic fox colonised the area because they moved over long distances season by season, something they still do today, in order to find food.Dr Pryor said: ""Arctic fox provided both food and hides to Palaeolithic hunters, with their fur coats reaching full length around the beginning of December; this winter fur usually begins shedding by early spring. They also lay down substantial stores of body fats seasonally that are greatest from late autumn throughout the winter season and do not start to become seriously depleted until early spring. Hunters most likely targeted the foxes in the late winter period -- before the onset of fur shedding and loss of critical fat supplies.""The high numbers of fox remains found at the site suggests what was happening was a deliberate, organised procurement strategy rather than just simple incidental hunting.""The analysis of teeth suggests hunters engaged in large-scale winter hunting of solitary Arctic foxes that were ranging widely across the landscape. The site was used as a base camp for ranging visits to maintain trapping lines and for processing hides.Krakow Spadzista was one of the most northerly sites in central Europe during the Late Gravettian when much of the northern plains region had already been abandoned.

In Switzerland, too, the hot weather got people sweating -- right on the heels of a string of unusually warm months. It was -- at the time -- the third hottest summer and the fourth warmest spring since measurements began in 1864.","Obviously, such unusual weather conditions also had an impact on ecosystems. Scientists from the group led by Nina Buchmann, Professor of Grassland Sciences, have now used extensive measurement data to show exactly how forests, fields and meadows reacted to the exceptional conditions in 2018. The researchers evaluated measurements from five sites, all of which are part of the Swiss FluxNet initiative, explains Mana Gharun, a postdoc in Buchmann's group and the study's lead author: ""The five sites cover all altitude levels from 400 to 2,000 metres above sea level. This means we've taken very different ecosystems into account.""At each of these sites, Buchmann's group has been taking measurements for years at very high temporal resolution of how much COTheir evaluation, which the researchers have just published in a special issue of the journal However, respiration rates for plants and soil organisms also increased at almost all the sites. This means that while these systems absorbed more COBuchmann points out that it is still too early for a final assessment: ""We definitely need long-term data series before we can put these findings in their proper context."" She and her group have been collecting measurement data at the abovementioned sites for many years, so she has a good foundation for such long-term studies.What made 2018 exceptional was not just the warm temperatures in spring and summer, but also the heavy precipitation during the preceding winter: when spring came, the mountains were covered by snow, which then melted very quickly due to the warm conditions. This benefited the higher-altitude ecosystems in particular. In contrast, the situation at lower altitudes was more difficult, as the ecosystems there were unable to use the excess water from winter to build up a soil moisture reservoir for the summer. Accordingly, they suffered more from the summer drought and heat.""Water availability is a decisive factor in how ecosystems survive periods of heat,"" Buchmann says. ""Thus, it is important to look beyond the actual dry period when studying a drought."" Another unsettling consideration is that the new CH2018 climate change scenarios predict more rain and less snow in winter. The higher levels of precipitation expected in the winter months is therefore of limited benefit to ecosystems when the water runs off quickly, rather than being stored as snow.Forests are now in a critical situation. There are several indications of this, one of which is that not only spruce trees but also old beech trees are now showing stress symptoms in many places across the Swiss Plateau. This is probably also due to the fact that the following year, 2019, was also warmer and drier than average. ""What we are seeing in the forests is a memory effect,"" Buchmann explains, ""so it's possible that the impacts of such periods may not show up until long after the actual extreme event.""How well the trees survive periods of drought and heat also depends on the depth at which they absorb water. Beech roots, for example, penetrate the soil to a depth of 50 or 60 centimetres and are therefore more likely to reach deeper moist layers. Spruce roots, on the other hand, reach a depth of only about 20 centimetres, making them more likely to be affected by droughts. ""Things are going to get uncomfortable for lowland spruce in the medium term,"" Buchmann notes. ""That's not a good forecast for forestry.""What about the meadows? The two researchers have not yet found a memory effect there because meadows recover more quickly after a dry period. Nevertheless, meadows at lower altitudes produce significantly less forage in a year like 2018 -- bad news for farmers. Grassland farming is the central pillar of Swiss agriculture. If less grass grows on meadows in the future because of increasing summer droughts, this will have direct consequences for milk and meat production.",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers led by Professor Nina Buchmann have analysed measurement data from five sites in Switzerland to understand how ecosystems reacted to the unusual weather conditions in 2018.

If the world's leading companies exercised leadership on climate change -- for instance, by requiring energy efficiency in their supply chains -- they could have a transformative effect on global efforts to reduce emissions.""However, companies' climate change policies often have little effect when it comes to big investment decisions such as where to build supply chains.""Assigning emissions to the investor country means multinationals are more accountable for the emissions they generate as a result of these decisions.""The study found that carbon emissions from multinationals' foreign investment fell from a peak of 22% of all emissions in 2011 to 18.7% in 2016. Researchers said this was a result of a trend of ""de-globalisation,"" with the volume of foreign direct investment shrinking, as well as new technologies and processes making industries more carbon efficient.Mapping the global flow of investment, researchers found steady increases in investment from developed to developing countries.

But the ""wrong-way"" migrators -- which include shellfish, snails, starfish, worms and others -- share a few crucial traits. As larvae, they are weak swimmers and rely on ocean currents for transportation. As adults, they tend to remain in place, sedentary or fixed to the seafloor.The researchers found that the warming ocean have caused these creatures to spawn earlier in the spring or summer, exposing their larvae to patterns of wind and water currents they wouldn't experience during the normal spawning season. As a result, the larvae are pushed toward the southwest and inland, where waters are warmer and they are less likely to survive. The adults stay in those areas and are trapped in a feedback loop in which even warmer waters lead to even earlier spawning times and a further shrinking of their occupied areas.The researchers compared this phenomenon to ""elevator-to-extinction"" events in which increasing temperatures drive birds and butterflies upslope until they are eliminated from areas they once inhabited. The effect on bottom-dwelling invertebrates is more insidious, however, because these creatures could potentially thrive in cooler regions, but earlier-spring currents prevent weak-swimming larvae from reaching that refuge.The researchers noted that these effects are influenced by localized wind and current patterns.

In an article recently featured in the journal,"Malik developed a method to study paleoclimate time series, sets of data that tell us about past climates using indirect observations. For example, by measuring the presence of a particular isotope in stalagmites from a cave in South Asia, scientists were able to develop a record of monsoon rainfall in the region for the past 5,700 years. But as Malik notes, studying paleoclimate time series poses several problems that make it challenging to analyze them with mathematical tools typically used to understand climate.""Usually the data we get when analyzing paleoclimate is a short time series with noise and uncertainty in it,"" said Malik. ""As far as mathematics and climate is concerned, the tool we use very often in understanding climate and weather is dynamical systems. But dynamical systems theory is harder to apply to paleoclimate data. This new method can find transitions in the most challenging time series, including paleoclimate, which are short, have some amount of uncertainty and have noise in them.""There are several theories about why the Indus Valley Civilization declined -- including invasion by nomadic Indo-Aryans and earthquakes -- but climate change appears to be the most likely scenario. But until Malik applied his hybrid approach -- rooted in dynamical systems but also draws on methods from the fields of machine learning and information theory -- there was no mathematical proof. His analysis showed there was a major shift in monsoon patterns just before the dawn of this civilization and that the pattern reversed course right before it declined, indicating it was in fact climate change that caused the fall.Malik said he hopes the method will allow scientists to develop more automated methods of finding transitions in paleoclimate data and leads to additional important historical discoveries.

Imagine a parcel of air that rushes over mountains, plunges toward cool valleys, shuttles across land and sea and ricochets off growing storms, bobbing up and down between layers of stable atmosphere in a great tug of war between buoyancy and gravity. A single wave can travel for thousands of miles, carrying momentum and heat along the way.Although lesser known than gravitational waves -- undulations in the fabric of space-time -- atmospheric gravity waves are ubiquitous and powerful, said Stanford University atmospheric scientist Aditi Sheshadri, senior author of a new study detailing changes in high-frequency gravity waves across seasons and latitudes. They cause some of the turbulence felt on airplanes flying in clear skies and have a strong influence on how storms play out at ground level.Published Aug. 30 in the ""This was just a very lucky thing because they weren't collecting data for any scientific mission. But, incidentally, they happened to be measuring position and temperature and pressure,"" said Sheshadri, who is an assistant professor of Earth system science at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth).The researchers calculated gravity wave motions from data that balloons collected over 6,811 separate 48-hour periods from 2014 to 2018. ""To mount an equivalent scientific campaign would be terribly expensive. With the Loon data, the analysis is messier because the data collection was incidental, but it has near-global coverage,"" Sheshadri said.Gravity waves are an important part of atmospheric dynamics. ""They help to drive the overall circulation of the atmosphere, but some gravity waves are too small and too frequent to be observed with satellites,"" said the study's lead author, Erik Lindgren, who worked on the research as a postdoctoral scholar in Sheshadri's lab. ""These are the gravity waves we have focused on in this study."" Earlier studies using atmospheric balloons to track high-frequency gravity waves have typically incorporated data from no more than a few dozen balloon flights, covering smaller areas and fewer seasons.The Loon data proved particularly valuable for calculating high-frequency gravity waves, which can rise and fall hundreds of times in a day, over distances ranging from a few hundred feet to hundreds of miles. ""They're tiny and they change on timescales of minutes. But in an integrated sense, they affect, for instance, the momentum budget of the jet stream, which is this massive planetary scale thing that interacts with storms and plays an important role in setting their course,"" Sheshadri said.Gravity waves also influence the polar vortex, a swirl of frigid air that usually hovers over the North Pole and can blast extreme cold into parts of Europe and the United States for months at a time. And they interact with the quasi-biennial oscillation, in which, roughly every 14 months, the belt of winds blowing high over the equator reverses direction -- with big impacts on ozone depletion and surface weather far beyond the tropics.As a result, understanding gravity waves is key to improving weather forecasts at the regional scale, especially as global warming continues to disrupt historical patterns. ""Getting gravity waves right would help constrain circulation responses to climate change, like how much it's going to rain in a particular location, the number of storms -- dynamical things such as wind and rain and snow,"" Sheshadri said.Current climate models estimate the effects of high-frequency gravity waves on circulation in a kind of black box, with few constraints from real-world observations or application of the limited existing knowledge of the physical processes at play. ""Until now, it has not been entirely clear how these waves behave in different regions or over the seasons at very high frequencies or small scales,"" Lindgren said.Sheshadri and colleagues focused on energy associated with high-frequency gravity waves at different time scales, and how that energy varies across seasons and latitudes. They found these waves are larger and build up more kinetic energy in the tropics and during the summer; smaller waves moving with less energy are more common close to the poles and during the winter. They also found gravity waves changing in sync with the phases of the quasi-biennial oscillation. ""We uncovered distinct shifts in gravity wave activity at different times of the year and over different parts of the globe,"" Lindgren said. ""As to exactly why is not clear.""In future research, Sheshadri aims to identify which gravity wave sources are responsible for these differences, and to extrapolate gravity wave amplitudes at very high frequencies from relatively infrequent observations. She said, ""Understanding how gravity waves drive circulation in the atmosphere, the interaction between these waves and the mean flow -- it's really the next frontier in understanding atmospheric dynamics.""",Climate,2020.0,"Atmospheric gravity waves, which are ripples in the air caused by blobs of air being forced upwards and then pulled down by gravity, are ubiquitous and powerful.

Even 15 years post-fire, as many as 80% of the plots the researchers surveyed still contained no new trees.Rodman and his team of coauthors -- including scientists from the U.S. Forest Service, Northern Arizona University, Colorado State University and the University of North Carolina Wilmington -- wanted to build on those studies, projecting the future by looking at the past.To that end, they looked at 22 burned areas encompassing 710 square miles from southern Wyoming through central and western Colorado to northern New Mexico. The team focused on ponderosa pine and Douglas fir forests, which make up about half of the forested area in the region.""For those of us who live along Colorado's Front Range, these are the trees that we see, live near and recreate in on a daily basis,"" said Rodman.The study, published in the journal Using satellite images and on-the-ground measurements, the scientists first reconstructed what the forests looked like prior to the fire. Then, by counting juvenile trees and looking at tree rings, they assessed how well the forests were recovering. Not surprisingly, those at higher-elevations with lower temperatures, and more precipitation fared better. Those with more surviving trees nearby (which can spread their seeds via wind and water) were also more likely to rebound.Meanwhile, lower-elevation forests, like those south of Pueblo or in portions of the Front Range foothills, proved less resilient.And compared to regions that burned in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the more recent burn areas failed to bounce back.""This study and others clearly show that the resilience of our forests to fire has declined significantly under warmer, drier conditions,"" said coauthor Tom Veblen, professor of geography at CU Boulder.The team then used statistical modeling to project what might happen in the next 80 years if montane forests of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir were to burn under different scenarios. In one scenario, humans do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change escalates unchecked. In another, considered a ""moderate emissions scenario,"" emissions begin to decline after 2040.Currently, the team estimates that about half of its study area is suitable for post-fire ""recovery."" (Trees there may return to at least their lowest densities from the 1800s).By 2051, under the moderate emissions scenario, less than 18% of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine forests will likely recover if burned. Under the higher emission scenario, that number dips to 6.3% for Douglas fir and 3.5% percent for pine forests.Meanwhile, Veblen notes, the number and intensity of wildfires will continue its steady rise. The number of acres burned annually across the country has already doubled since the 1990s.""The big takeaway here is that we can expect to have an increase in fire continue for the foreseeable future, and, at the same time, we are going to see much of our land convert from forest to non-forest,"" said Veblen.Rodman, now a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, hopes the database of post-fire recovery he and his team have created can help land managers better plan where to invest their resources, or not, after a fire.For instance, they may be better off planting seedlings in regions more likely to bounce back, rather than plant them in dry sites no longer suitable for their survival.He also hopes the projections spelled out in the paper give people one more reason to care about climate change.""This was a hard study to write and can be a bit depressing to read, but there are some positive takeaways,"" he said. ""If we can get a handle on some of these trends and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the outcomes may not look so dire. The future is not written in stone.""",Climate,2020.0,"A new study by the University of Colorado Boulder shows that forests in the Southern Rocky Mountains may not grow back after fires and instead convert to grasslands and shrublands.

The lunar surface and interior, however, are virtually devoid of oxygen, so pristine metallic iron is prevalent on the Moon and highly oxidized iron has not been confirmed in samples returned from the Apollo missions. In addition, hydrogen in solar wind blasts the lunar surface, which acts in opposition to oxidation. So, the presence of highly oxidized iron-bearing minerals, such as hematite, on the Moon is an unexpected discovery.""Our hypothesis is that lunar hematite is formed through oxidation of lunar surface iron by the oxygen from the Earth's upper atmosphere that has been continuously blown to the lunar surface by solar wind when the Moon is in Earth's magnetotail during the past several billion years,"" said Li.To make this discovery, Li, HIGP professor Paul Lucey and co-authors from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and elsewhere analyzed the hyperspectral reflectance data acquired by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) designed by NASA JPL onboard India's Chandrayaan-1 mission.This new research was inspired by Li's previous discovery of water ice in the Moon's polar regions in 2018.""When I examined the M3 data at the polar regions, I found some spectral features and patterns are different from those we see at the lower latitudes or the Apollo samples,"" said Li. ""I was curious whether it is possible that there are water-rock reactions on the Moon.

Jones worked as a faculty researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks when the project began in 2012.The ancient sea ice record comes in the form of changes in the relative amounts of two isotopes of the element oxygen -- oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. The ratio of those two isotopes changes depending on patterns in the atmosphere and ocean, reflecting the different signatures that precipitation has around the globe. More oxygen-18 makes for an isotopically ""heavier"" precipitation, more oxygen-16 makes precipitation ""lighter.""By analyzing data from a model that tracks atmospheric movement using the isotopic signature of precipitation, the authors found that heavier precipitation originated from the North Pacific, while lighter precipitation originated from the Arctic.A ""heavy"" ratio signals a seasonal pattern that causes the amount of sea ice to decrease. A ""light"" ratio indicates a season with more sea ice. That connection has been confirmed though sea ice satellite data collected since 1979, and to a smaller extent, through the presence of some microorganisms in previous core samples.UAF's Alaska Stable Isotope Facility analyzed isotope ratios throughout the peat layers, providing a time stamp for ice conditions that existed through the millennia.After reviewing the isotopic history, researchers determined that modern ice conditions are at remarkably low levels.""What we've seen most recently is unprecedented in the last 5,500 years,"" said Matthew Wooller, director of the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility and a contributor to the paper.

Their new study is featured on the cover of the Sept. 3 issue of Featured on the cover of the Sept. 3 issue of Biodiversity is changing worldwide not only through the loss of species, but by species composition becoming more similar across different regions -- a process called biotic homogenization. Just as diversification in an investment portfolio buffers it from downturns in certain sectors, diversity across ecosystems buffers natural systems from widespread collapse. The researchers found that homogenization affects mutualistic networks made up of plants and the animals that disperse their seeds. By compiling data from hundreds of sites around the world, they found that interactions involving a plant or animal that was an introduced species has increased seven-fold over the past 75 years. The resulting loss of the portfolio effect poses greater risk of sweeping disruption by broad-scale stressors such as climate change or disease outbreaks.Introduced species are also influencing the structure of mutualistic networks in ways that reduce stability of individual ecosystems. When researchers look at the web of species interactions within natural ecosystems, there are often 'compartments' of closely interacting species that interact little outside their compartment. ""This makes a network resilient because a disturbance such as overhunting, disease, or a pesticide that affects a certain species does not spread to affect species in other compartments,"" explained study author Evan Fricke, of SESYNC. The study shows that introduced species are often so generalized that they interact across multiple compartments, causing the loss of compartmentalized network structure and exposing more species to a given disruption.The research also shows how regions that naturally had different combinations of species and interactions because of historic geographic isolation now are linked. ""Eurasian blackbirds dispersing hawthorn seeds is a common mutualistic interaction among species native to Europe,"" Fricke said. ""Today, that same species interaction also occurs on the opposite side of the planet in New Zealand where those species have been introduced by people.""The researchers quantified how introduced species have altered geographic patterns in the global web of mutualistic interactions. ""What's striking to see is that natural biogeographic patterns that have existed for millions of years are being erased so quickly,"" Fricke said. A consequence of these new connections is that co-evolved relationships unique to isolated places in Madagascar, Hawaii, or New Zealand are now affected by introduced species. The loss of isolation changes the co-evolutionary trajectories of these mutualisms, which may cause species to evolve traits more similar to species in other parts of the world. ""However, the introduced species may with time also themselves diverge from their source populations, adapting to their new setting,"" added study author Jens-Christian Svenning, professor and director of BIOCHANGE.As mutually beneficial interactions, seed dispersal mutualisms can determine which species are successful as ecosystems change over time. Compared to native species, introduced species are twice as likely to interact with partners that are also introduced, according to the study. This feedback may favor regeneration of introduced plants over native species. ""These could have knock-on homogenizing effects for plant communities during natural reforestation of degraded forests, as well as plant range shifts as a result of climate change,"" Fricke said.""While many unintentionally introduced species may cause homogenizing effects that threaten ecosystem integrity, other introduced species may provide ecological benefits or even reverse the effects of biotic homogenization,"" Svenning continued. In the Hawaiian Islands, introduced animals perform nearly all seed dispersal for native plants after numerous extinctions and severe declines in native bird populations. While Hawaii represents an extreme case, ecosystems around the world have experienced steep declines of their largest animals, many of which are important seed dispersers. Like the birds in Hawaii, introduced large mammals can perform functions missing due to the decline of native species. ""Our future research will target which species interact in ways that are likely to further homogenize ecosystems and those that can reverse homogenization by filling ecological roles lost due to past species decline,"" Svenning concluded.",Climate,2020.0,"Introduced species are rapidly reshaping mutualistic relationships between plants and animals, creating new ecological links between previously disconnected ecosystems, according to a study by researchers at the University of Maryland's National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center and the Center for Biodiversity Dynamics in a Changing World at Aarhus University.

And this geologic study shows that as oceans became more acidic, this is reflected in the thickness of these reef crusts,"" said Associate Professor Jody Webster from the School of Geosciences, who coordinated the study.The 'reef glue' is made up of calcified deposits from microbes that live within reef formations around the world. Known as microbialites, these structures play an important role in many types of aquatic systems and are probably best known from the ancient stromatolites that are built by cyanobacteria in Western Australia, which are billions of years old.In some types of reef systems, including the Great Barrier Reef, microbialite crusts likely formed by sulfate-reducing bacteria stabilise and bind the reef framework, forming a robust scaffold that can be used by corals and other reef builders to colonise and grow.In the past these crusts have been more abundant than the corals and algae that grow on and around them and they display variations in thickness over time, while still performing their structural role.""This means they are really good indicators of changes in environmental conditions of our oceans,"" Associate Professor Webster said.The study found a variation in thickness from 11.5 centimetres 22,500 years ago to about 3 centimetres in younger Great Barrier Reef sections, about 12,000 years ago.When combined with studies from 17 reef systems worldwide, the data shows this thinning of the microbialite crusts coincides with pH dropping below 8.2 right up to modern times.The researchers gathered a dataset of microbial crusts from the Great Barrier Reef as far back as 30,000 years. They compared a comprehensive three-dimensional analysis of samples to two-dimensional scans of the crust thickness.The results from the Great Barrier Reef show that the two-dimensional analysis of crust thickness provides an accurate proxy for the more detailed three-dimensional method. Compiling 2D sample data from across the world, the scientific team built a global model of microbialite thickness through time.The study found that the 2D technique gave results within 10 percent of the 3D analysis.""A real breakthrough here is that we are confident we can now apply a 2D analysis to reefs and obtain reliable information about the history of microbialite formations. This will give us substantial savings in time and resources,"" Associate Professor Webster said.""Previous studies have given us glimpses as to how these microbial crusts respond to changes in their environment.

However, in some tropical areas, rice can continue to grow year after year when taken care of properly.Just as grass grows back in a lawn after it is mowed, rice can be cut after it is harvested, and the plant will regrow. The farming practice of cutting the rice above ground and allowing it to regrow is called ratooning.Although Rice ratooning allows farmers to harvest more rice from the same fields, it requires a longer growing season compared to traditional single-harvest rice farming.In many areas of the world where rice is grown, a long growing season isn't a problem due to the tropical climates.

But researchers report in ACS' ","Enteroviruses can cause infections as benign as a cold or as dangerous as polio. Found in feces, they are released into the environment from sewage and other sources. Their subsequent survival depends on their ability to withstand the environmental conditions they encounter. Because globalization and climate change are expected to alter those conditions, Anna Carratalà, Tamar Kohn and colleagues wanted to find out how viruses might adapt to such shifts and how this would affect their disinfection resistance.The team created four different populations of a human enterovirus by incubating samples in lake water in flasks at 50 F or 86 F, with or without simulated sunlight. The researchers then exposed the viruses to heat, simulated sunlight or microbial ""grazing"" and found that warm-water-adapted viruses were more resistant to heat inactivation than cold-water-adapted ones. Little or no difference was observed among the four strains in terms of their inactivation when exposed to either more simulated sunlight or other microbes.

A new study, published Aug. 31 in the journal ","New genetic analyses show that corals, which together with sea anemones make up a class of animals known as anthozoans, have been on the planet for 770 million years. That is 250 million years before the earliest undisputed fossil evidence of their existence -- and long enough to experience massive shifts in climate, fluctuations in ocean chemistry and several mass extinctions.In the new study, a research team led by scientists from Harvey Mudd College, the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History examined how these past conditions affected anthozoan diversity. That was possible thanks to a new molecular approach developed by Andrea Quattrini, research zoologist and curator of corals at the National Museum of Natural History, Catherine McFadden, a biologist at Harvey Mudd College, and Estefanía Rodríguez, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History, which allowed the team to compare nearly 2,000 key regions of anthozoan genomes to discern the evolutionary relationships between species. The team analyzed hundreds of anthozoan specimens that were collected from around the world and are now stored in museum collections. When this molecular data was aligned with fossil evidence of anthozoan history, it revealed how these diverse animals evolved over geologic time.Over the Earth's history, changes in acidity and ion concentrations have shifted the ocean's chemical composition between two states, known as aragonite and calcite seas. These changes, as well as changes in ocean water temperature, appear to have played an important role in determining what kinds of skeletons corals were able to produce and, thus, how anthozoans evolved.Stony corals -- the type that build massive reefs that support complex marine ecosystems -- take up minerals from the water to construct hard skeletons from a form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite. Other corals, such as sea fans and black corals, build their softer skeletons from protein or calcite (a less soluble form of calcium carbonate), whereas sea anemones have no skeleton at all.Working with an international team of researchers, including Gabriela Farfan, the National Museum of Natural History's Coralyn W. Whitney Curator of Gems and Minerals, Quattrini and colleagues found that stony corals did not arise until conditions favored the construction of their aragonite skeletons -- periods of aragonite seas, when ocean temperatures were relatively cool. During periods of calcite seas, when carbon dioxide is more abundant in the atmosphere and oceans are more acidic, evolution favored anemones and corals that built their skeletons from protein or calcite.Notably, it was these other anthozoans that fared best after reef crises -- times when up to 90% of reef-building organisms died off as oceans warmed and became more acidic. ""Our study showed that after these reef crises, we actually get an increased diversification of anthozoans in general, particularly those that can do well under these climate conditions -- ones that aren't producing aragonite and aren't making big reefs,"" Quattrini said.That is consistent with observations from today's reefs, which are threatened by climate change and other human activities. ""Current ecological studies have shown that when stony corals die off, these other anthozoans start to colonize dead coral and prosper,"" Quattrini said. ""We actually see that in our evolutionary tree, too.""""Unfortunately, although these softer-bodied species may adapt better to climate change than stony corals, they don't form large reefs,"" McFadden said. ""So, in the future, reefs may be replaced by different marine communities. This already appears to be happening in the Caribbean where stony corals are being replaced by 'forests' of sea fans.""Today, about 1,300 species of stony coral inhabit the ocean, favored by aragonite sea conditions. But rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are warming and acidifying the waters, making them less hospitable for these and other organisms whose shells and skeletons are made from aragonite. ""Aragonite is expected to dissolve under ocean acidification,"" Quattrini said. ""As our seas are becoming more acidic and warmer, it's likely that the skeletons of corals will dissolve or not be able to grow.""The new study suggests that as the climate changes, these ecosystems may also see increased diversification of anthozoans without aragonite skeletons. Nevertheless, loss of reef-building corals will have devastating consequences for communities who depend on reefs and the rich, complex ecosystems they support for fishing, shoreline protection and tourism. ""Corals have suffered extinctions in the past when climate has posed challenges, and we'll likely see that in the future,"" Quattrini said. ""The best way to protect them is to curb our carbon emissions.""""This study shows us how nature through evolution is able to adapt, survive and reinvent itself, so when hard corals are not able to survive, their soft-bodied relatives such as sea anemones will thrive instead,"" Rodríguez said.

OSU researchers wanted to understand how local communities are reacting.""There's obviously national and state-level climate change policy, but we're really interested in what goes on at the local level to adapt to these changes,"" said lead author Leanne Giordono, a post-doctoral researcher in OSU's College of Public Health and Human Sciences. ""Local communities are typically the first to respond to extreme events and disasters. How are they making themselves more resilient -- for example, how are they adapting to more frequent flooding or intense heat?""For the study, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, Giordono and co-authors Hilary Boudet of OSU's College of Liberal Arts and Alexander Gard-Murray at Harvard University examined 15 extreme weather events that occurred around the U.S. between March 2012 and June 2017, and any subsequent local climate policy change.These events included flooding, winter weather, extreme heat, tornadoes, wildfires and a landslide.The study, published recently in the journal ""For both recipes, experiencing a high-impact event -- one with many deaths or a presidential disaster declaration -- is a necessary condition for future-oriented policy adoption,"" Giordono said.In addition to a high death toll, the first recipe consisted of Democrat-leaning communities where there was focused media coverage of the weather event. These communities moved forward with adopting policies aimed at adapting in response to future climate change, such as building emergency preparedness and risk management capacity.The second recipe consisted of Republican-leaning communities with past experiences of other uncommon weather events. In these locales, residents often didn't engage directly in conversation about climate change but still worked on policies meant to prepare their communities for future disasters.In both recipes, policy changes were fairly modest and reactive, such as building fire breaks, levees or community tornado shelters. Giordono referred to these as ""instrumental"" policy changes.""As opposed to being driven by ideology or a shift in thought process, it's more a means to an end,"" she said. ""'We don't want anyone else to die from tornadoes, so we build a shelter.' It's not typically a systemic response to global climate change.""In their sample, the researchers didn't find any evidence of mitigation-focused policy response, such as communities passing laws to limit carbon emissions or require a shift to solar power. And some communities did not make any policy changes at all in the wake of extreme weather.The researchers suggest that in communities that are ideologically resistant to talking about climate change, it may be more effective to frame these policy conversations in other ways, such as people's commitment to their community or the community's long-term viability.Without specifically examining communities that have not experienced extreme weather events, the researchers cannot speak to the status of their policy change, but Giordono said it is a question for future study.""In some ways, it's not surprising that you see communities that have these really devastating events responding to them,"" Giordono said.

The anatomy of fossil plants growing in the Andean Altiplano region 10 million years ago calls current paleoclimate models into question, suggesting that the area was more humid than models predict.","On an expedition to the Central Andean Plateau, researchers from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) and colleagues were astounded to find a huge fossil-tree buried in the cold, grassy plain. The plant fossil record from this high-altitude site in southern Peru contains dramatic reminders that the environment in the Andes mountains changed drastically during the past 10 million years, but not in the ways that climate models of the past suggest. Findings from the expedition are presented in the journal ""This tree and the hundreds of fossil wood, leaf and pollen samples we collected on the expedition, reveal that when these plants were alive the ecosystem was more humid -- even more humid than climate models of the past predicted,"" said Camila Martinez, a fellow at STRI, who recently finished her doctorate at Cornell University. ""There is probably no comparable modern ecosystem, because temperatures were higher when these fossils were deposited 10 million years ago.""The anatomy of the petrified (permineralized) wood the researchers found is very much like wood anatomy in low-elevation tropical forests today. Indeed, the altitude then was probably only 2,000 meters above sea level.But that ecosystem did not last for long. Today, the arid, intermountain plateau lies at 4,000 meters above sea level.Five million year-old fossils from the same sites confirmed that the Puna ecosystem that now dominates the Andes' high mountain plateaus had been born: the younger pollen samples were mostly from grasses and herbs, rather than from trees. Leaf material was from ferns, herbs and shrubs, indicating that the plateau had already risen to its current altitude.""The fossil record in the region tells us two things: both the altitude and the vegetation changed dramatically over a relatively short period of time, supporting a hypothesis that suggests the tectonic uplift of this region occurred in rapid pulses,"" said Carlos Jaramillo, STRI staff scientist and project leader.""Andean uplift played an important role in shaping the climate of South America, but the relationship between the rise of the Andes, local climates and vegetation is still not well understood,"" Martinez said.

This is the conclusion reached by a group of researchers from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) and Università degli Studi die Ferrara (UNIFE) on the basis of finds in the Sesselfelsgrotte cave in Lower Bavaria.,"Neanderthals lived approximately 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in large areas of Europe and the Middle East, even as far as the outer edges of Siberia. They produced tools using wood and glass-like rock material, which they also sometimes combined, for example to make a spear with a sharp and hard point made of stone.From approximately 100,000 years ago, their universal cutting and scraping tool was a knife made of stone, the handle consisting of a blunt edge on the tool itself. These Keilmesser (backed, asymmetrical bifacially-shaped knives) were available in various shapes, leading researchers to wonder why the Neanderthals created such a variety of knives? Did they use different knives for different tasks or did the knives come from different sub-groups of Neanderthals? This was what the international research project hoped to find out.""Keilmesser are a reaction to the highly mobile lifestyle during the first half of the last ice age. As they could be sharpened again as and when necessary, they were able to be used for a long time -- almost like a Swiss army knife today,"" says Prof. Dr. Thorsten Uthmeier from the Institute of Prehistory and Early History at FAU. ""However, people often forget that bi-facially worked knives were not the only tools Neanderthals had. Backed knives from the Neanderthal period are surprisingly varied,"" adds his Italian colleague Dr. Davide Delpiano from Sezione di Scienze Preistoriche e Antropologiche at UNIFE. ""Our research uses the possibilities offered by digital analysis of 3D models to discover similarities and differences between the various types of knives using statistical methods.""The two researchers investigated artefacts from one of the most important Neanderthal sites in Central Europe, the Sesselfelsgrotte cave in Lower Bavaria. During excavations in the cave conducted by the Institute of Prehistory and Early History at FAU, more than 100,000 artefacts and innumerable hunting remains left behind by the Neanderthals have been found, even including evidence of a Neanderthal burial. The researchers have now analysed the most significant knife-like tools using 3D scans produced in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Marc Stamminger and Dr. Frank Bauer from the Chair of Visual Computing at the Department of Computer Science at FAU. They allow the form and properties of the tool to be recorded extremely precisely.""The technical repertoire used to create Keilmesser is not only direct proof of the advanced planning skills of our extinct relatives, but also a strategical reaction to the restrictions imposed upon them by adverse natural conditions,"" says Uthmeier, FAU professor for Early Prehistory and Archaeology of Prehistoric Hunters and Gatherers.What Uthmeier refers to as 'adverse natural conditions' are climate changes after the end of the last interglacial more than 100,000 years ago. Particularly severe cold phases during the following Weichsel glacial period began more than 60,000 years ago and led to a shortage of natural resources. In order to survive, the Neanderthals had to become more mobile than before, and adjust their tools accordingly.The Neanderthals probably copied the functionality of unifacial backed knives, which are only shaped on one side, and used these as the starting point to develop bi-facially formed Keilmesser shaped on both sides. ""This is indicated in particular by similarities in the cutting edge, which consists in both instances of a flat bottom and a convex top, which was predominantly suited for cutting lengthwise, meaning that it is quite right to refer to the tool as a knife,"" says Davide Delpiano from UNIFE.Both types of knife -- the simpler older version and the newer, significantly more complex version -- obviously have the same function. The most important difference between the two tools investigated in this instance is the longer lifespan of bi-facial tools. Keilmesser therefore represent a high-tech concept for a long-life, multi-functional tool, which could be used without any additional accessories such as a wooden handle.""Studies from other research groups seem to support our interpretation,"" says Uthmeier. ""Unlike some people have claimed, the disappearance of the Neanderthals cannot have been a result of a lack of innovation or methodical thinking.""",Climate,2020.0,"Researchers from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) and the University of Ferrara have analysed artefacts from a Neanderthal site in Lower Bavaria to investigate why the hominids used a variety of knives.

And what happens around these currents is even more interesting.""We know marine heatwaves are on the rise globally, but policymakers, fisheries experts, aquaculture industries and ecologists need to know how this will play out at regional levels, especially in terms of where they will occur and how much hotter they will be,"" said lead author from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes Dr Hakase Hayashida.""Our detailed modelling is the first step in peeling back these layers, revealing the temperature variation that occurs across these currents and around them, indicating where the sharpest rises in marine heatwaves are likely to occur.""For instance, we found intense marine heatwaves were more likely to form well off the coast of Tasmania, while along the Gulf Stream more intense marine heatwaves start to appear more frequently close to the shore along the stretch of coastline from the state of Virginia to New Brunswick. This will almost certainly change ecosystems in these regions.""The key to this research was the use of two near-global high-resolution (1/10o) simulations over current and future periods developed by CSIRO Ocean Downscaling Strategic Project, which could reproduce eddies 100km across and generate realistic boundary currents and fronts.. This detailed approach revealed the, sometimes, stark regional variability in ocean temperature extremes much more variable than coarser global climate models.The researchers confirmed the accuracy of their model by comparing the detailed model outputs with observations from 1982-2018. They then used the same high-resolution model to project how marine heatwaves would alter with climate change out to 2050.In every western boundary current they examined, more intense marine heatwaves appeared. In general marine heatwaves also occurred more frequently.But on the edge of these currents, it was a different story. Eddies that spun off from the main current created areas where the increases in numbers of heatwave days were lower than average and even some regions where heatwave intensity declined.""Like so many aspects of the climate system, the warming of the oceans isn't the same everywhere, which means the ecology will respond differently to global warming, depending on location,"" said Assoc Prof Peter Strutton.""Detailed modelling like this is the first step in understanding which ecosystems will thrive or decline, how the productivity of the ocean will change, and those parts of the food chain most likely to be affected.

For instance, if the tropical Pacific is warmer and trade winds are weaker than usual -- an El Niño event -flooding in California typically occurs and monsoon failures in India and East Asia are detrimental to local rice production. In contrast, during a La Niña the global weather patterns reverse with cooler temperatures and stronger trade winds in the tropical Pacific. These natural climate swings affect ecosystems, fisheries, agriculture, and many other aspects of human society.Computer models that are used for projecting future climate correctly predict global warming due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions as well as short-term year-to-year natural climate variations associated with El Niño and La Niña.""There is, however, some model discrepancy on how much the tropical Pacific will warm,"" said Malte Stuecker, co-author and assistant professor in the Department of Oceanography and International Pacific Research Center at UH Manoa. ""The largest differences are seen in the eastern part of the tropical Pacific, a region that is home to sensitive ecosystems such as the Galapagos Islands. How much the eastern tropical Pacific warms in the future will not only affect fish and wildlife locally but also future weather patterns in other parts of the world.""Researchers have been working for decades to reduce the persistent model uncertainties in tropical Pacific warming projections.Many climate models simulate El Niño and La Niña events of similar intensity.

In other words, while in most models El Niño and La Niña are symmetric, they are asymmetric in nature.In this new study, the scientists analyzed observational data and numerous climate model simulations and found that when the models simulate the subsurface ocean current variations more accurately, the simulated asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña increases -- becoming more like what is seen in nature.""Identifying the models that simulate these processes associated with El Niño and La Niña correctly in the current climate can help us reduce the uncertainty of future climate projections,"" said corresponding lead author Michiya Hayashi, a research associate at the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan, and a former postdoctoral researcher at UH Manoa supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Overseas Research Fellowships. ""Only one-third of all climate models can reproduce the strength of the subsurface current and associated ocean temperature variations realistically.""""Remarkably, in these models we see a very close relationship between the change of future El Niño and La Niña intensity and the projected tropical warming pattern due to greenhouse warming,"" noted Stuecker.That is, the models within the group that simulate a future increase of El Niño and La Niña intensity show also an enhanced warming trend in the eastern tropical Pacific due to greenhouse warming. In contrast, the models that simulate a future decrease of El Niño and La Niña intensity show less greenhouse gas-induced warming in the eastern part of the basin. The presence of that relationship indicates that those models are capturing a mechanism known to impact climate -- signifying that those models are more reliable. This relationship totally disappears in the two-thirds of climate models that cannot simulate the subsurface ocean current variations correctly.""Correctly simulating El Niño and La Niña is crucial for projecting climate change in the tropics and beyond. More research needs to be conducted to reduce the biases in the interactions between wind and ocean so that climate models can generate El Niño -- La Niña asymmetry realistically,"" added Fei-Fei Jin, co-author and professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at UH Manoa.""The high uncertainty in the intensity change of El Niño and La Niña in response to greenhouse warming is another remaining issue,"" said Stuecker. ""A better understanding of Earth's natural climate swings such as El Niño and La Niña will result in reducing uncertainty in future climate change in the tropics and beyond.""",Climate,2020.0,"El Niño and La Niña events, which cause changes in trade winds and temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, have a significant impact on weather patterns across the world. The effects include flooding in California and monsoon failures in India and East Asia during El Niño, while La Niña sees cooler temperatures and stronger trade winds. These changes affect ecosystems, fisheries, agriculture and other aspects of human society. Climate models can accurately predict global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, but there is uncertainty over how much the tropical Pacific will warm. Researchers have been working to reduce model uncertainties and identify those that simulate El Niño and La Niña events correctly",,

""In contrast, shorter-lived species that kept breeding during droughts faced strong reductions in survival.""Martin has spent his career venturing into remote jungles and living there for months to study the lives of birds. For this work, he and Mouton studied 38 different bird species in Venezuela and Malaysia over multiple years. There was one drought year for each field site, and the authors modeled future population results for the birds using three different climate change scenarios.They knew behavioral responses to drought might determine the relative impacts on survival and reproduction. At the jungle study sites, researchers located and monitored nests of all species over many years to examine reproductive activity prior to and during the droughts. They also banded birds with colored material and used intensive re-sighting of these birds to obtain rigorous estimates of survival.The researchers found drought reduced reproduction an average of 36% in the 20 Malaysian species and 52% in the 18 Venezuelan species.""The negative impacts of drought on survival are well documented,"" Martin said. ""We therefore also expected the droughts to reduce survival, but thought that the reduced breeding activity might limit the decrease in survival.""He said they found the population impacts of droughts were largely nullified by the reproductive behavioral shifts in longer-lived species, but shorter-lived species saw less of a benefit.""Overall, our results have several major implications,"" Martin said. ""First, we show that understanding behavioral responses to drought are critical for predicting population responses. Behavioral responses to environmental conditions can help buffer the most sensitive vital rates for a given species and mitigate the overall effect on fitness.""Second, our results provide unique support to the idea that reproduction can negatively affect survival,"" he said. ""This idea of a 'cost of reproduction' is central to life history theory but only rarely documented in wild populations.""Finally, long-lived species are argued to be most sensitive to climate change, but the UM research suggests that many longer-lived species actually may be more resilient to drought impacts of climate change than previously expected.""Ultimately, we hope our study can help motivate future studies into behavioral and demographic responses to shifting patterns of rainfall in more species so we can better anticipate the different impacts of climate change among species,"" Martin said.",Climate,2020.0,"New research from the University of Montana has found that tropical songbirds reduce reproduction during severe droughts, which can actually increase their survival rates.

That consumption comes with the cost of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, though. So, how can we use energy to keep the economy alive without burning out the planet in the process?","In a paper in ""How do we achieve a steady-state economy where economic production exists, but does not continually increase our size and add to our energy demands?"" Garrett says. ""Can we survive only by repairing decay, simultaneously switching existing fossil infrastructure to a non-fossil appetite? Can we forget the flame?""Garrett is an atmospheric scientist. But he recognizes that atmospheric phenomena, including rising carbon dioxide levels and climate change, are tied to human economic activity. ""Since we model the earth system as a physical system,"" he says, ""I wondered whether we could model economic systems in a similar way.""He's not alone in thinking of economic systems in terms of physical laws. There's a field of study, in fact, called thermoeconomics. Just as thermodynamics describe how heat and entropy (disorder) flow through physical systems, thermoeconomics explores how matter, energy, entropy and information flow through human systems.Many of these studies looked at correlations between energy consumption and current production, or gross domestic product. Garrett took a different approach; his concept of an economic system begins with the centuries-old idea of a heat engine. A heat engine consumes energy at high temperatures to do work and emits waste heat. But it only consumes. It doesn't grow.Now envision a heat engine that, like an organism, uses energy to do work not just to sustain itself but also to grow. Due to past growth, it requires an ever-increasing amount of energy to maintain itself. For humans, the energy comes from food. Most goes to sustenance and a little to growth. And from childhood to adulthood our appetite grows. We eat more and exhale an ever-increasing amount of carbon dioxide.""We looked at the economy as a whole to see if similar ideas could apply to describe our collective maintenance and growth,"" Garrett says. While societies consume energy to maintain day to day living, a small fraction of consumed energy goes to producing more and growing our civilization.""We've been around for a while,"" he adds. ""So it is an accumulation of this To test this hypothesis, Garrett and his colleagues used economic data from 1980 to 2017 to quantify the relationship between past cumulative economic production and the current rate at which we consume energy. Regardless of the year examined, they found that every trillion inflation-adjusted year 2010 U.S. dollars of economic worldwide production corresponded with an enlarged civilization that required an additional 5.9 gigawatts of power production to sustain itself . In a fossil economy, that's equivalent to around 10 coal-fired power plants, Garrett says, leading to about 1.5 million tons of COThey came to two surprising conclusions. First, although improving efficiency through innovation is a hallmark of efforts to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, efficiency has the side effect of making it easier for civilization to grow and consume more.Second, that the current rates of world population growth may not be the cause of rising rates of energy consumption, but a symptom of past efficiency gains.""Advocates of energy efficiency for climate change mitigation may seem to have a reasonable point,"" Garrett says, ""but their argument only works if civilization maintains a fixed size, which it doesn't. Instead, an efficient civilization is able to grow faster. It can more effectively use available energy resources to make more of everything, including people. Expansion of civilization accelerates rather than declines, and so do its energy demands and COSo what do those conclusions mean for the future, particularly in relation to climate change? We can't just stop consuming energy today any more than we can erase the past, Garrett says. ""We have inertia. Pull the plug on energy consumption and civilization stops emitting but it also becomes worthless. I don't think we could accept such starvation.""But is it possible to undo the economic and technological progress that have brought civilization to this point? Can we, the species who harnessed the power of fire, now ""forget the flame,"" in Garrett's words, and decrease efficient growth?""It seems unlikely that we will forget our prior innovations, unless collapse is imposed upon us by resource depletion and environmental degradation,"" he says, ""which, obviously, we hope to avoid.""So what kind of future, then, does Garrett's work envision? It's one in which the economy manages to hold at a steady state -- where the energy we use is devoted to maintaining our civilization and not expanding it.It's also one where the energy of the future can't be based on fossil fuels. Those have to stay in the ground, he says.""At current rates of growth, just to maintain carbon dioxide emissions at their current level will require rapidly constructing renewable and nuclear facilities, about one large power plant a day. And somehow it will have to be done without inadvertently supporting economic production as well, in such a way that fossil fuel demands also increase.""It's a ""peculiar dance,"" he says, between eliminating the prior fossil-based innovations that accelerated civilization expansion, while innovating new non-fossil fuel technologies. Even if this steady-state economy were to be implemented immediately, stabilizing COBy looking at the global economy through a thermodynamic lens, Garrett acknowledges that there are unchangeable realities. Any form of an economy or civilization needs energy to do work and survive. The trick is balancing that with the climate consequences.""Climate change and resource scarcity are defining challenges of this century,"" Garrett says. ""We will not have a hope of surviving our predicament by ignoring physical laws.""This study marks the beginning of the collaboration between Garrett, Grasselli and Keen. They're now working to connect the results of this study with a full model for the economy, including a systematic investigation of the role of matter and energy in production.""Tim made us focus on a pretty remarkable empirical relationship between energy consumption and cumulative economic output,"" Grasselli says. ""We are now busy trying to understand what this means for models that include notions that are more familiar to economists, such as capital, investment and the always important question of monetary value and inflation.""",Climate,2020.0,"Atmospheric scientist, Tim Garrett, has proposed a new economic model that considers the impact of human economic activity on rising carbon dioxide levels and climate change.

The data sets on the Earth's gravitational field which are required for this, stem from the GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. As these data sets only include the typical large-scale mass anomalies, no conclusions about small scale structures, such as the actual distribution of water masses in rivers and river branches, are possible. Using the South American continent as an example, the Earth system modellers at the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ, have developed a new Deep-Learning-Method, which quantifies small as well as large-scale changes to the water storage with the help of satellite data. This new method cleverly combines Deep-Learning, hydrological models and Earth observations from gravimetry and altimetry.","So far it is not precisely known, how much water a continent really stores. The continental water masses are also constantly changing, thus affecting the Earth's rotation and acting as a link in the water cycle between atmosphere and ocean. Amazon tributaries in Peru, for example, carry huge amounts of water in some years, but only a fraction of it in others. In addition to the water masses of rivers and other bodies of fresh water, considerable amounts of water are also found in soil, snow and underground reservoirs, which are difficult to quantify directly.Now the research team around primary author Christopher Irrgang developed a new method in order to draw conclusions on the stored water quantities of the South American continent from the coarsely-resolved satellite data. ""For the so called down-scaling, we are using a convolutional neural network, in short CNN, in connection with a newly developed training method,"" Irrgang says. ""CNNs are particularly well suited for processing spatial Earth observations, because they can reliably extract recurrent patterns such as lines, edges or more complex shapes and characteristics.""In order to learn the connection between continental water storage and the respective satellite observations, the CNN was trained with simulation data of a numerical hydrological model over the period from 2003 until 2018. Additionally, data from the satellite altimetry in the Amazon region was used for validation. What is extraordinary, is that this CNN continuously self-corrects and self-validates in order to make the most accurate statements possible about the distribution of the water storage. ""This CNN therefore combines the advantages of numerical modelling with high-precision Earth observation"" according to Irrgang.The researchers' study shows that the new Deep-Learning-Method is particularly reliable for the tropical regions north of the -20° latitude on the South American continent, where rain forests, vast surface waters and also large groundwater basins are located. Same as for the groundwater-rich, western part of South America's southern tip. The down-scaling works less well in dry and desert regions. This can be explained by the comparably low variability of the already low water storage there, which therefore only have a marginal effect on the training of the neural network. However, for the Amazon region, the researchers were able to show that the forecast of the validated CNN was more accurate than the numerical model used.In future, large-scale as well as regional analysis and forecasts of the global continental water storage will be urgently needed. Further development of numerical models and the combination with innovative Deep-Learning-Methods will take up a more important role in this, in order to gain comprehensive insight into continental hydrology. Aside from purely geophysical investigations, there are many other possible applications, such as studying the impact of climate change on continental hydrology, the identification of stress factors for ecosystems such as droughts or floods, and the development of water management strategies for agricultural and urban regions.",Climate,2020.0,A new method has been developed to estimate the amount of water stored in South America's continent using satellite data.

New research from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) reveals the distinct impact that ocean acidification is having on coral growth on some of the world's iconic reefs.","In a paper published Aug. 27, 2020, in the journal ""This is the first unambiguous detection and attribution of ocean acidification's impact on coral growth,"" says lead author and WHOI scientist Weifu Guo. ""Our study presents strong evidence that 20th century ocean acidification, exacerbated by reef biogeochemical processes, had measurable effects on the growth of a keystone reef-building coral species across the Great Barrier Reef and in the South China Sea. These effects will likely accelerate as ocean acidification progresses over the next several decades.""Roughly a third of global carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by the ocean, causing an average 0.1 unit decline in seawater pH since the pre-industrial era. This phenomenon, known as ocean acidification, has led to a 20 percent decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater. Animals that rely on calcium carbonate to create their skeletons, such as corals, are at risk as ocean pH continues to decline. Ocean acidification targets the density of the skeleton, silently whittling away at the coral's strength, much like osteoporosis weakens bones in humans.""The corals aren't able to tell us what they're feeling, but we can see it in their skeletons,"" said Anne Cohen, a WHOI scientist and co-author of the study. ""The problem is that corals really need the strength they get from their density, because that's what keeps reefs from breaking apart. The compounding effects of temperature, local stressors, and now ocean acidification will be devastating for many reefs.""In their investigation, Guo and his co-authors examined published data collected from the skeletons of Porites corals -- a long-living, dome-shaped species found across the Indo-Pacific -- combined with new three-dimensional CT scan images of Porites from reefs in the central Pacific Ocean. Using these skeletal archives, which date back to 1871, 1901, and 1978, respectively, the researchers established the corals' annual growth and density. They plugged this information, as well as historical temperature and seawater chemistry data from each reef, into a model to predict the corals' response to constant and changing environmental conditions.The authors found that ocean acidification caused a significant decline in Porites skeletal density in the Great Barrier Reef (13 percent) and the South China Sea (7 percent), starting around 1950. Conversely, they found no impact of ocean acidification on the same types of corals in the Phoenix Islands and central Pacific, where the protected reefs are not as impacted by pollution, overfishing, runoff from land.While carbon dioxide emissions are the largest driver of ocean acidification on a global scale, the authors point out that sewage and runoff from land can exacerbate the effect, causing even further reductions of seawater pH on nearby reefs. The authors attribute the declining skeletal density of corals on the Great Barrier Reef and South China Sea to the combined effects of ocean acidification and runoff. Conversely, reefs in marine protected areas of the central Pacific have so far been shielded from these impacts.""This method really opens a new way to determine the impact of ocean acidification on reefs around the world,"" said Guo. ""Then we can focus on the reef systems where we can potentially mitigate the local impacts and protect the reef.""Co-authors of the paper include Rohit Bokade (Northeastern University), Nathaniel Mollica (MIT-WHOI joint program), and Muriel Leung (University of Pennsylvania), as well as Russell Brainard of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and formerly at the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division of the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center.Funding for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Tiffany & Co. Foundation, the Robertson Foundation, the Atlantic Donor Advised Fund, and WHOI's Investment in Science Fund.An innovative numerical model developed by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution demonstrates the distinct impact of ocean acidification -- separate from ocean warming -- on coral growth.The model shows that ocean acidification has caused a 13 percent decline in the skeletal density of Porites corals in the Great Barrier Reef, and a 7 percent decline in the South China Sea since 1950.Pollution and land runoff can exacerbate the effects of ocean acidification, causing corals in local reefs to weaken more quickly than those located farther away from human settlements.A global-scale investigation of coral CT scans could help to target protections for vulnerable reefs.",Climate,2020.0,"Ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide emissions by the ocean, has been found to have a measurable impact on the growth of coral, according to a study by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Researchers now know,"A University of Arizona-led team has nailed down the temperature of the last ice age -- the Last Glacial Maximum of 20,000 years ago -- to about 46 degrees Fahrenheit.","Their findings allow climate scientists to better understand the relationship between today's rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide -- a major greenhouse gas -- and average global temperature.The Last Glacial Maximum, or LGM, was a frigid period when huge glaciers covered about half of North America, Europe and South America and many parts of Asia, while flora and fauna that were adapted to the cold thrived.""We have a lot of data about this time period because it has been studied for so long,"" said Jessica Tierney, associate professor in the UArizona Department of Geosciences. ""But one question science has long wanted answers to is simple: How cold was the ice age?""Tierney is lead author of a paper published today in ""In your own personal experience that might not sound like a big difference, but, in fact, it's a huge change,"" Tierney said.She and her team also created maps to illustrate how temperature differences varied in specific regions across the globe.""In North America and Europe, the most northern parts were covered in ice and were extremely cold. Even here in Arizona, there was big cooling,"" Tierney said. ""But the biggest cooling was in high latitudes, such as the Arctic, where it was about 14 C (25 F) colder than today.""Their findings fit with scientific understanding of how Earth's poles react to temperature changes.""Climate models predict that the high latitudes will get warmer faster than low latitudes,"" Tierney said. ""When you look at future projections, it gets really warm over the Arctic. That's referred to as polar amplification. Similarly, during the LGM, we find the reverse pattern. Higher latitudes are just more sensitive to climate change and will remain so going forward.""Knowing the temperature of the ice age matters because it is used to calculate climate sensitivity, meaning how much the global temperature shifts in response to atmospheric carbon.Tierney and her team determined that for every doubling of atmospheric carbon, global temperature should increase by 3.4 C (6.1 F), which is in the middle of the range predicted by the latest generation of climate models (1.8 to 5.6 C).Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the ice age were about 180 parts per million, which is very low. Before the Industrial Revolution, levels rose to about 280 parts per million, and today they've reached 415 parts per million.""The Paris Agreement wanted to keep global warming to no larger than 2.7 F (1.5 C) over pre-industrial levels, but with carbon dioxide levels increasing the way they are, it would be extremely difficult to avoid more than 3.6 F (2 C) of warming,"" Tierney said. ""We already have about 2 F (1.1 C) under our belt, but the less warm we get the better, because the Earth system really does respond to changes in carbon dioxide.""Since there were no thermometers in the ice age, Tierney and her team developed models to translate data collected from ocean plankton fossils into sea-surface temperatures. They then combined the fossil data with climate model simulations of the LGM using a technique called data assimilation, which is used in weather forecasting.""What happens in a weather office is they measure the temperature, pressure, humidity and use these measurements to update a forecasting model and predict the weather,"" Tierney said. ""Here, we use the Boulder, Colorado-based National Center for Atmospheric Research climate model to produce a hindcast of the LGM, and then we update this hindcast with the actual data to predict what the climate was like.""In the future, Tierney and her team plan to use the same technique to recreate warm periods in Earth's past.""If we can reconstruct past warm climates,"" she said, ""then we can start to answer important questions about how the Earth reacts to really high carbon dioxide levels, and improve our understanding of what future climate change might hold.""The research was supported by the Heisings-Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has revealed that the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period, when glaciers covered half of North America, Europe, South America and parts of Asia, was 6.1°F colder than today.

The shelves help slow interior glaciers' slide toward the ocean, so if they were to fail, sea levels around the world could surge rapidly as a result. The study appears this week in the leading journal ","Ice shelves are giant tongues of ice floating on the ocean around the edges of the continent. The vast land-bound glaciers behind them are constantly pushing seaward. But because many shelves are largely confined within expansive bays and gulfs, they are compressed from the sides and slow the glaciers' march -- somewhat like a person in a narrow hallway bracing their arms against the walls to slow someone trying to push past them. But ice shelves experience a competing stress: they stretch out as they approach the ocean. Satellite observations show that, as a result, they rip apart; most are raked with numerous long fractures perpendicular to the direction of stretching. Fractures that form at the surface can be tens of meters deep; others, forming from the bottom, can penetrate the ice hundreds of meters upward. Some fractures are hundreds of meters wide.Currently, most of the shelves are frozen year round, and stable. But scientists project that widespread warming could occur later in the century. And, existing research has shown that even subtle temperature swings can spur widespread melting. This could send melt water surging into the surface fractures. Such surges would potentially cause hydrofracturing-a process in which liquid water, heavier than ice, would violently force the fractures to zip open, and cause the shelf to rapidly disintegrate The new study estimates that 50 to 70 percent of the areas of the ice shelves buttressing the glaciers are vulnerable to such processes.""It's not just about melting, but where it's melting,"" said lead author Ching-Yao Lai, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.""The ice shelves-that's the weak spot, where the atmosphere, the ice and ocean interact,"" said study coauthor Jonathan Kingslake, a glaciologist at Lamont-Doherty. ""If they fill up with melt water, things can happen very quickly after that, and there could be major consequences for sea levels.""Hydrofracturing has already occurred in a few places. Parts of the Larsen Ice Shelf, which had been stable for at least 10,000 years, disintegrated within just days in 1995 and 2002. This was followed by the partial breakup of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008 and 2009. The main agreed-upon causes: hydrofracturing. The Larsen and Wilkins comprise some of the northernmost ice on the continent, and so have been the first to suffer under rising temperatures and seasonal melting.The new study follows a 2017 paper led by Kingslake showing that seasonal ponds and streams on the ice surface are far more common across Antarctica than previously believed; some reach within 375 miles of the South Pole. But most cataloged features are in places not subject to hydrofracturing. The new study shows that, so far, only about 0.6 percent of East Antarctic ice shelves that provide buttressing experience melt-water ponding, making them vulnerable. A much larger percentage would potentially be endangered, if warming takes hold.In collaboration with Cameron Chen, a researcher from Google, Lai trained a machine-learning model to identify ice-shelf fracture locations across Antarctica, to produce the first continent-wide map of such features. Although most fractures now contain no liquid water, the scientists considered future cases in which melt water might fully fill the surface fractures. This allowed them to predict which parts of the shelves would be vulnerable to hydrofracturing, when factoring in the competing forces of compression from the sides, and stretching of the ice from back to front.They calculated that inflow of liquid into the existing fractures could potentially exert enough force to cause widespread hydrofracturing across 50 to 70 percent of the ice-shelf areas that provide buttressing. The main exceptions were smaller, solider areas of ice closest to land, which experience less stress from stretching. The end portions of the shelves, mostly surrounded by open ocean, are also vulnerable, but floating freely as they do, those do not help hold back the glaciers.While the study flashes a warning, the researchers say they cannot predict the ice shelves' behavior with any exactitude. ""How fast melt water would form and fill in those cracks is the first question,"" said Kingslake. He said the worst-case scenario would be that ""lots of places will be covered by lots and lots of water by the end of the century."" But projections vary widely, depending on which models scientists use, and how vigorously humanity cuts greenhouse gases, or not. The second question is whether particular locations will undergo hydrofracturing, he said. The third question: whether the process would run away, causing the shelf to undergo explosive Larsen-type disintegration.Theodore Scambos, a leading Antarctic glaciologist and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said the paper ""does a great job of pointing to areas where one can say, 'If it floods with melt here, it's likely to break up the shelf."" He added that it ""has huge implications for sea level"" if summer temperatures along the coasts rise.""Eventually, all the ice shelves could be covered by melt water,"" said Lai. ""But we don't have a time frame, and there are a lot of big questions left.""The study was also coauthored by Martin Wearing of the University of Edinburgh; Pierre Gentine, Harold Li and Julian Spergel of Columbia; and J. Melchior van Wessem of Utrecht University.",Climate,2020.0,"Ice shelves around Antarctica that buttress glaciers could be vulnerable to rapid disintegration due to hydrofracturing, according to a study by researchers from Columbia University and Google.

And, that an increased focus on the Arctic and reduced global warming, more generally, are musts.Climate models ought to take abrupt changes into account Until now, climate models predicted that Arctic temperatures would increase slowly and in a stable manner.

Doing so will allow us to create better models that can accurately predict temperature increases:""Changes are occurring so rapidly during the summer months that sea ice is likely to disappear faster than most climate models have ever predicted. We must continue to closely monitor temperature changes and incorporate the right climate processes into these models,"" says Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen.

Black carbon is an important short-term climate driver because it absorbs solar energy and can affect the formation and composition of clouds.","The extent of black carbon's impact on clouds has been the subject of debate for 30 years. A study recently published by Colorado State University atmospheric scientists aims to settle the debate and improve climate models.Previous studies done in the laboratory conflicted on whether black carbon was effective at ice nucleation, a process important to cloud formation. Soot particles, like other types of aerosol particles in the air, can act as the foundation for ice crystal growth. Lab results on soot ranged wildly from no ice nucleation activity to efficient ice formation.""One reason these results could span such a range is that combustion processes that form black carbon are extremely complicated and differ depending on fuels burned, and on whether combustion is carefully controlled, as in a diesel engine, or uncontrolled, as in wildfires,"" said Gregory Schill, first author on the study and a former NSF postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Atmospheric Science.Schill and his colleagues sampled smoke from wildfires and prescribed burns, then filtered out soot particles using a technique he developed with other members of Professor Sonia Kreidenweis and Paul DeMott's research group. This work builds on Schill's previous investigation of black carbon particles from diesel engine exhaust, conducted at the CSU Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory.Combining the knowledge gained through these experiments, Schill and his colleagues simulated the contributions of black carbon ice-nucleating particles versus other natural sources in a global model. They found black carbon is not as important as previously thought for ice particle formation in mid-level clouds, the clouds most responsible for precipitation over continents.Natural sources, such as dust and sea spray, have more influence on mid-level cloud properties. These cloud attributes variously affect climate by reflecting sunlight, releasing precipitation and determining how long the cloud persists.""Our results suggest that black carbon, regardless of fuel types or combustion conditions, have similar ice formation properties in mid-level clouds, and these are less efficient at forming ice compared to other non-anthropogenic sources,"" Schill said.Atmospheric models have overestimated the role of black carbon as an ice-nucleating particle, and these findings correct that misunderstanding.""This provides a clearer picture of the factors, both natural and anthropogenic, that might impact clouds and precipitation in a future climate,"" Schill said.The study eliminates black carbon as the primary suspect for ice formation from smoke particles but leaves many unanswered questions about how biomass burning affects clouds.""Black carbon is only one component of a complex soup that makes up smoke,"" Schill said. ""We know that something in smoke can form ice particles, but we do not fully understand what these cloud seeds are.""CSU atmospheric scientists are working on that problem, including a study by the Kreidenweis/DeMott group that addresses biomass burning's contribution of such seeds to cloud levels.

This new analysis provides a benchmark alongside conventional, ground-based monitoring of groundwater levels to assess changes in water storage in aquifers over time. This information is essential to inform sustainable management of groundwater resources.""This new study updates and extends previous analyses, accounting for strong seasonality in groundwater storage in the analysis of trends. It shows that a minority (only 5) of the world's 37 large aquifers is undergoing depletion that requires further attention for better management.Co-author, Professor of Hydrogeology, Richard Taylor from UCL Geography, said: ""The findings do not deny that groundwater depletion is occurring in many parts of the world but that the scale of this depletion, frequently associated with irrigation in drylands, is more localised than past studies have suggested and often occurs below a large (~100 000 km2) 'footprint' of mass changes tracked by a pair of GRACE satellites.""For the majority, trends are non-linear and irregular, exhibiting considerable variability in volume over time. The study shows further that variability in groundwater storage in drylands is influenced positively and episodically by years of extreme (>90th percentile) precipitation.For example, in the Great Artesian Basin of Australia, extreme seasonal rainfall over two successive summers in 2010 and 2011 increased groundwater storage there by ~90 km3, more than ten times total annual freshwater withdrawals in the UK. Elsewhere in the Canning Basin of Australia, however, groundwater depletion is occurring at a rate of 4.4 km3 each year that is associated with its use in the extraction of iron ore.To avoid continued depletion of aquifers, the study promotes sustainable groundwater withdrawals through augmented replenishments from extreme rainfall and 'managed aquifer recharge' practices.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study led by the University of Sussex has shown that while groundwater depletion is occurring in many parts of the world, the scale of this depletion is more localised than previously thought.
