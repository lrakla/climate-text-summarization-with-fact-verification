Human activities are however causing grasslands to become a source of greenhouse gas emissions rather than a carbon sink. A new study uncovered how grasslands used by humans have changed our climate over the last centuries.","Grasslands are the most extensive terrestrial biome on Earth and are critically important for animal forage, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. They absorb and release carbon dioxide (COTo address this knowledge gap, an international research team quantified the changes in carbon storage and greenhouse gas fluxes in natural and managed grasslands between 1750 and 2012 in their study published in ""We built and applied a new spatially explicit global grassland model that includes mechanisms of soil organic matter and plant productivity changes driven by historical shifts in livestock and the reduction of wild grazers in each region. This model is one of the first to simulate the regional details of land use change and degradation from livestock overload,"" explains Jinfeng Chang who led this study at IIASA and is now based at Zhejiang University in China. ""We also looked at the effect of fires, and soil carbon losses by water erosion; CHThe study shows that emissions of CH""Our results show that the different human activities that have affected grasslands have shifted the balance of greenhouse gas removals and emissions more towards warming in intensively exploited pastures, and more towards cooling in natural and semi-natural systems. Coincidently, until recently the two types of grasslands have almost been canceling each other out,"" notes coauthor Thomas Gasser from IIASA. ""However, the recent trends we see towards the expansion of pasture land and higher livestock numbers lead us to expect that global grasslands will accelerate climate warming if better policies are not put in place to favor soil carbon increases, stop deforestation for ranching, and develop climate-smart livestock production systems.""According to the authors, the cooling services provided by sparsely grazed or wild grasslands, makes it clear that countries should assess not only the greenhouse gas budgets of their managed pastures (such as specified in the current national greenhouse gas reporting rules of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change), but also the sinks and sources of sparsely grazed rangelands, steppes, tundra, and wild grasslands. Full greenhouse gas reporting for each country could facilitate the assessment of progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and better link national greenhouse gas budgets to the observed growth rates of emissions in the atmosphere.""In the context of low-warming climate targets, the mitigating or amplifying role of grasslands will depend on a number of aspects. This includes future changes in grass-fed livestock numbers; the stability of accumulated soil carbon in grasslands; and whether carbon storage can be further increased over time or if it will saturate, as observed in long-term experiments,"" concludes Philippe Ciais, a study coauthor from the Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment (LSCE).",Climate,2021.0,"Grasslands are the largest terrestrial biome on Earth and are crucial for animal forage, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.

In some cases droughts can lead to very long-term (>10 years) and irreversible soil changes, with major impacts on water quality when soils are rewet after the drought ends.""We have seen many examples of how drought in the Murray-Darling Basin has caused major issues including acidification of soil and water due to acid sulfate soils exposure in wetlands. This review highlights substantial gaps in our global understanding of the effects of drought on wet soils and how they will respond to increasing drought,"" says Associate Professor Mosley, who is also Deputy Director of the Acid Sulfate Soils Centre.Effects can be different in different soil types and different regions of the world. The spatial distribution of drought studies shows there has been limited assessment in a large number of regions, including south and central America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania. Many of these regions are predicted to be vulnerable to drought impacts due to climate change.Lead author Dr Erinne Stirling, from Zhejiang University (China) and the University of Adelaide, says one of the most pressing findings from this review is that there are huge swaths of the world where there is no readily available published research on drought-affected wet soils.And secondly, she says, there is effectively no applied research into water management outcomes for wetlands and wetland soils.""At a global level, wet soils are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and need to be protected given the very high environmental and socio-economic values they support.

Ghost forests are areas where rising seas have killed off freshwater-dependent trees, leaving dead or dying white snags standing in marsh.","The study found that the transition from forest to marsh along the coastline of the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula led to a significant loss in the amount of carbon stored in the plants and trees above ground. When released into the atmosphere as a gas, carbon can contribute to global warming. However, researchers also uncovered some ways landowners can offset some of those carbon losses.""Many people think about sea-level rise as being more of a long-term threat,"" said the study's lead author Lindsey Smart, a research associate at the North Carolina State University Center for Geospatial Analytics. ""But we're actually seeing significant changes over shorter time periods because of this interaction between gradual sea-level rise and extreme weather events like hurricanes or droughts, which can bring salt water further inland.""In the study, researchers tracked the spread of ghost forests across 2,485 square miles on the peninsula. They found that on unmanaged, or natural, land such as publicly owned wildlife areas, ghost forests spread across 15 percent of the area between 2001 and 2014.Using models created using data on vegetation height and type in the area, they calculated that across the 13 years of the study, 130,000 metric tons of carbon were lost from the spread of ghost forests on unmanaged land.According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, that's equivalent to what would be emitted into the air by 102,900 passenger vehicles driven for one year.""Coastal forests are really unique in that they store carbon both in their foliage, and in their really rich organic soil,"" Smart said. ""As saltwater intrusion increases, you're going to see impacts both to the aboveground and the belowground carbon. While we measured aboveground carbon losses, the next step will be to look at the response of these carbon stores below ground to saltwater exposure.""Researchers said it's unclear exactly what happens to the carbon released when the forests are killed by salt water, and it could be that it goes into the soil.While they found ghost forests spread along the peninsula's coastline, they also saw that the losses at the coast were offset by tree plantings in forests grown for timber during the study.That was one land-management practice that they found could offset carbon losses due to ghost forest spread. They also saw that the use of canals and drainage ditches had an impact on carbon losses. Canals could either aid saltwater encroachment on the land, or help prevent it, depending on their use.""Drainage networks, if not maintained, can serve as conduits for saltwater intrusion,"" Smart said.They also reported that catastrophic wildfires likely worsened the spread of ghost forest along the coast and had a greater impact on the loss of aboveground carbon compared with ghost forest spread.""We think there may be an interaction between salt water and fire that accelerates forest retreat, and facilitates marsh migration into areas that were once healthy coastal forest,"" Smart said.The researchers said drought also played a role in ghost forest spreads.""Two severe droughts within the study period produced larger-than-typical wildfires and facilitated salinization of normally freshwater ecosystems,"" said study co-author Paul Taillie, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida and former graduate student at N.C. State. ""Thus the combination of rising sea level and future drought would be expected to cause a large net loss in biomass.""Overall, the study helps create a map of areas that are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, and offers clues to help prevent loss of coastal forests.""Our paper helps to identify areas that are most vulnerable to the impact of sea-level rise and extreme weather events,"" Smart said.

Yellen's co-authors are colleagues Jonathan Woodruff, Caroline Ladlow and undergraduate Waverly Lau at UMass Amherst, plus Sarah Fernald at New York's department of environmental conservation and David K. Ralston of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.Yellen notes that for this ""very collaborative"" study, the researchers took advantage of ""an experiment that has already happened over decades or centuries. Many of these accidental tidal marshes worked; they protect the shoreline and provide one of the richest ecosystems in terms of direct ecological and human benefits.""Further, marshes are ""really useful,"" he adds -- as a first line of defense against coastal flooding, essential habitat for juvenile commercial fish species, they store huge amounts of carbon that mitigates climate change, they provide habitat for migratory birds, filter nutrients coming off the land ""and they're beautiful.""Yellen and colleagues write that these tidal wetlands ""currently trap roughly 6% of the Hudson River's sediment load. Results indicate that when sediment is readily available, freshwater tidal wetlands can develop relatively rapidly in sheltered settings. The study sites serve as useful examples to help guide future tidal marsh creation and restoration efforts.""Their research involved seven sites spanning more than 100 miles of the Hudson Estuary, ""from Wall Street up to Albany,"" Yellen says. The bays where tidal marshes developed started out six to seven feet deep and have steadily grown vertically. ""One concern for marshes globally is that they will be drowned by rising sea level, but this case study shows how marshes can be created and it gave us some timing benchmarks for what is considered a tricky ecosystem restoration,"" he adds.The researchers used two main methods to investigate the river's history and resilience in the face of sea level rise -- sediment cores that shed light on how fast sediment accumulated and historical maps, charts and aerial photos to determine how the sites have changed over time. Yellen summarizes, ""As long as there is space for sediment to accumulate, new marshes can develop. There is a community of land trusts up and down the river who are planning now for future sea level rise and considering where new marshes can form.

Using satellite images to track global tundra ecosystems over decades, a new study found the region has become greener, as warmer air and soil temperatures lead to increased plant growth.","""The Arctic tundra is one of the coldest biomes on Earth, and it's also one of the most rapidly warming,"" said Logan Berner, a global change ecologist with Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, who led the recent research. ""This Arctic greening we see is really a bellwether of global climatic change -- it's a biome-scale response to rising air temperatures.""The study, published this week in When the tundra vegetation changes, it impacts not only the wildlife that depend on certain plants, but also the people who live in the region and depend on local ecosystems for food. While active plants will absorb more carbon from the atmosphere, the warming temperatures could also be thawing permafrost, thereby releasing greenhouse gasses. The research is part of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), which aims to better understand how ecosystems are responding in these warming environments and the broader social implications.Berner and his colleagues used the Landsat data and additional calculations to estimate the peak greenness for a given year for each of 50,000 randomly selected sites across the tundra. Between 1985 and 2016, about 38% of the tundra sites across Alaska, Canada, and western Eurasia showed greening. Only 3% showed the opposite browning effect, which would mean fewer actively growing plants. To include eastern Eurasian sites, they compared data starting in 2000, when Landsat satellites began regularly collecting images of that region. With this global view, 22% of sites greened between 2000 and 2016, while 4% browned.""Whether it's since 1985 or 2000, we see this greening of the Arctic evident in the Landsat record,"" Berner said. ""And we see this biome-scale greening at the same time and over the same period as we see really rapid increases in summer air temperatures.""The researchers compared these greening patterns with other factors, and found that it's also associated with higher soil temperatures and higher soil moisture.

This allows the researchers to investigate what is driving the changes to the tundra.

However, little research has been done on them so far. Geographers at the South Asia Institute of Heidelberg University have now examined the spreading of aufeis and, for the first time, created a full inventory of these aufeis fields. The more than 3,700 accumulations of laminated ice are important for these high mountain areas between South and Central Asia, particularly with respect to hydrology and climatology.","In the semi-arid Himalaya regions of India and Pakistan, meltwater from snow and glaciers plays an essential role for irrigation in local agriculture and hydropower generation. In this context, aufeis has been given little attention. It appears as thin sheet-like layers of ice that form through successive freezing of water and can be several meters thick. This phenomenon occurs on a seasonal basis below springsheds, along rivulets or streams under conditions of frequent freeze-thaw cycles. ""In individual cases, this process is deliberately fostered through the construction of stone walls. These artificial reservoirs are used in some valleys of Upper Indus tributaries as water harvesting measures to bridge the seasonal water shortage in spring. However, the amount of ice, size and number of natural aufeis fields have been unknown so far,"" underlines Prof. Dr Marcus Nüsser from the South Asia Institute of Heidelberg University.The Heidelberg geographers have now compiled an inventory of these fields for the whole Upper Indus Basin and, in this context, also analysed the role of topographical parameters such as altitude and slope. The basis were several field campaigns spent in the region along with the evaluation of almost 8,300 Landsat satellite images taken between 2010 and 2020. With this imagery, the scientists were able to record the characteristic seasonal formation of aufeis and map the annually recurring bodies of ice. They detected over 3,700 aufeis fields, covering a total area of approximately 300 square kilometers. The majority of the aufeis fields lie in the Trans-Himalaya of Ladakh and on the Tibetan Plateau. In contrast, they hardly occur at all in the western part of the Upper Indus region, Marcus Nüsser explains.The study is part of a project funded by the German Research Foundation about the significance of aufeis and ice reservoirs for the population and agriculture in the Indian region of Ladakh. The participating scientists are studying the effectiveness of the different types of ice reservoirs and whether they function efficiently on a seasonal basis. ""Climate change alters both the melt rate and the annual timing of runoff, which causes increasing uncertainties for irrigated agriculture,"" emphasises Prof. Nüsser.

Final energy is that delivered to the consumer's door, for example, heating, electricity or the petrol that goes into a car, rather than the energy embedded in fuels themselves -- much of which is lost at power stations in the case of fossil fuels.The team built a final energy-model, which builds upon a list of basic material needs that underpin human well-being previously developed by Narasimha Rao and Jihoon Min.The study compared current final energy consumption across 119 countries to the estimates of final energy needed for decent living and found the vast majority of countries are living in significant surplus. In countries that are today's highest per-capita consumers, energy cuts of nearly 95% are possible while still providing decent living standards to all.Study lead author Dr Joel Millward-Hopkins from the School of Earth and Environment at Leeds said: ""Currently, only 17% of global final energy consumption is from non-fossil fuel sources. But that is nearly 50% of what we estimate is needed to provide a decent standard of living for all in 2050.""""Overall, our study is consistent with the long-standing arguments that the technological solutions already exist to support reducing energy consumption to a sustainable level.

This gap is likely to worsen, while food waste will increase and pressure on the environment will go up, a new study shows. Researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) assessed the consequences if the current nutrition transition, from scarce starch-based diets towards processed foods and animal products, continues -- the calculations combine, for the first time, estimates for under- and overweight, food composition and waste. Their findings provide a startling look ahead: By 2050, more than 4 billion people could be overweight, 1.5 billion of them obese, while 500 million people continue to be underweight.","""If the observed nutrition transition continues, we will not achieve the United Nations goal of eradicating hunger worldwide,"" explains Benjamin Bodirsky from PIK, lead author of the study just published in Scientific Reports. ""At the same time, our future will be characterized by overweight and obesity of mind-blowing magnitude."" By 2050, 45 percent of the world's population could be overweight and 16 percent obese -- compared to about 29 and 9 percent in 2010. This development is due to the insufficient global distribution of food as well as to the shift from scarcely processed plant-based diets towards unbalanced, affluent diets, where animal protein, sugar and fat displace whole grains and pulses.And that's not all as Bodirsky underlines: ""The increasing waste of food and the rising consumption of animal protein mean that the environmental impact of our agricultural system will spiral out of control. Whether greenhouse gases, nitrogen pollution or deforestation: we are pushing the limits of our planet -- and exceed them.""Crop and grazing land for food production cover about one third of the global land area; our food system is responsible for up to a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. The study projects that -- if current trends continue -- global food demand will increase by about 50% between 2010 and 2050, the demand for animal products like meat and milk will approximately double, a development that requires more and more land.""Using the same area of land, we could produce much more plant-based food for humans than animal-based food,"" explains co-author Alexander Popp, head of PIK's Land Use Management Research Group. ""To put it in a very simplistic way: If more people eat more meat, there's less plant-based food for the others -- plus we need more land for food production which can lead to forests being cut down. And greenhouse gas emissions rise as a consequence of keeping more animals.""The study provides a first-of-its kind, consistent long-term overview of a continued global nutrition transition from 1965 to 2100, using an open-source model that forecasts how much of food demand can be attributed to factors like population growth, ageing, increasing height, growing body mass index, declining physical activity and increasing food waste. Co-author Prajal Pradhan from PIK explains: ""There is enough food in the world -- the problem is that the poorest people on our planet have simply not the income to purchase it. And in rich countries, people don't feel the economic and environmental consequences of wasting food."" But redistribution alone would not be sufficient, as actually both the poor and the rich eat poorly: There is a lack of knowledge about a healthy way of life and nutrition.""Unhealthy diets are the world's largest health risks,"" co-author Sabine Gabrysch, head of PIK's Research Department on Climate Resilience explains. ""While many countries in Asia and Africa currently still struggle with undernutrition and associated health problems, they are increasingly also faced with overweight, and as a consequence, with a rising burden of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer,"" she adds. The study could provide valuable orientation about the potential development pathway of different countries and regions. It could also support much-needed pro-active policies for a qualitative transition towards sustainable and healthy diets.Sabine Gabrysch concludes: ""We urgently need political measures to create an environment that promotes healthy eating habits. This could include binding regulations that limit the marketing of unhealthy snacks and promote sustainable and healthy meals in schools, hospitals and canteens.

""This is the first time we have gone through all the uncertainties and included them in a single estimate.""Matthews identifies five key uncertain parameters affecting the remaining carbon budget.The first is the amount of observed warming that has occurred to date; the second is the amount of COUsing a new set of equations, the researchers were able to relate these parameters to each other and calculate a unified distribution of the remaining carbon budget.The 440 billion tonnes of COThese numbers are based on accounting for geophysical uncertainties (those related to scientific understanding of the climate system), but not socioeconomic ones (those relating to human decisions and socioeconomic systems). The decisions humans make in the near-term matter greatly and have the potential to either increase or decrease the size of the remaining carbon budget. In the new framework, these decisions could add (or remove) as much as 170 billion tonnes of COThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented humans with an opportunity, Matthews argues. The year 2020 experienced a noticeable drop in emissions from 2019 due in large part to reduced human mobility. If we are able to direct recovery investments in ways that would continue this decrease (rather than allowing emissions to rebound) we would greatly increase our chances of remaining under the 1.5°C Paris Agreement target.Another source of cautious optimism lies with the incoming Biden administration in the United States, which has made climate change a priority.""I am optimistic that having national leadership in the US that can mobilize efforts on climate change will make a big difference over the coming years,"" Matthews adds. ""The momentum is shifting in the right direction, but it is still not happening fast enough.""",Climate,2021.0,"Researchers have developed a new framework to estimate the remaining carbon budget and have found that humans can emit no more than 230 billion to 440 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide to stay under the target laid out by the 2015 international accord.

As such, there have been times in which the transition between the two climate states appeared with either regular or irregular periodicity. AWI researcher Peter Köhler has now discovered that the irregular appearance of interglacials has been more frequent than previously thought. His study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of Earth's fundamental climate changes.","In order to understand human beings' role in the development of our current climate, we have to look back a long way, since there has always been climate change -- albeit over vastly different timescales than the anthropogenic climate change, which is mainly due to the use of fossil fuels over the past 200 years. Without humans, for millions of years, climate altered between glacial and interglacial states over periods of many thousands of years, mainly because of the Earth's tilt which changes by a few degrees with a periodicity of 41,000 years. This in turn changes the angle at which the sun's rays strike Earth -- and as such the energy that reaches the planet, especially at high latitudes in summer. However, there is strong evidence that during the course of the last 2.6 million years, interglacials have repeatedly been 'skipped'. The Northern Hemisphere -- particularly North America -- remained frozen for long periods, despite the angle of the axial tilt changing to such an extent that more solar energy once again reached Earth during the summer, which should have melted the inland ice masses. This means Earth's tilt can't be the sole reason for Earth's climate to alter between glacial and interglacial states.In order to solve the puzzle, climate researchers are investigating more closely at what points in Earth's history irregularities occurred. Together with colleagues at Utrecht University, physicist Peter Köhler from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) has now made a significant contribution towards providing a clearer picture of the sequence of glacial and interglacial periods over the last 2.6 million years. Until now, experts thought that, especially over the past 1.0 million years, glacial and interglacial periods deviated from their 41,000- year cycle, and that interglacial periods were skipped, as a result of which some glacial periods lasted for 80,0000 or even 120,000 years. ""For the period between 2.6 and 1.0 million years ago, it was assumed that the rhythm was 41,000 years,"" says Peter Köhler. But as his study, which has now been published in the scientific journal Köhler's study is particularly interesting because he re-evaluated a well-known dataset that researchers have been using for several years -- the LR04 climate dataset -- yet arrived at completely different conclusions. This dataset consists of a global evaluation of core samples from deep-sea sediments that are millions of years old, and includes measurements from the ancient shells of microscopic, single-celled marine organisms -- foraminifera -- that were deposited on the ocean floor. Foraminifera incorporate oxygen from the seawater into their calcium shells. But over millennia, the level of specific oxygen isotopes -- oxygen atoms that have differing numbers of neutrons and therefore different masses -- varies in seawater.The LR04 dataset contains measurements of the ratio of the heavy oxygen isotope 18O to the lighter 16O. The ratio of 18O/16O stored in the foraminifera's shells depends on the water temperature. But there is also another effect that leads to relatively large amounts of 18O being found in the foraminifera's shells in glacial periods: when, during the course of a glacial period, there is heavy snowfall on land, which leads to the formation of thick ice sheets, the sea level falls -- in the period studied, by as much as 120 m. Since 18O is heavier than 16O, water molecules containing this heavy isotope evaporate less readily than molecules containing the lighter isotope. As such, comparatively more 18O remains in the ocean and the 18O content of the foraminifera shells increases. ""If you take the LR04 dataset at face value, it means you blur two effects -- the influence of ocean temperature and that of land ice, or rather that of sea level change,"" says Peter Köhler. ""This makes statements regarding the alternation of the glacial periods uncertain."" And there is an additional factor: climate researchers mainly determine the sequence of glacial periods on the basis of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere. But using 18O values doesn't allow us to say whether prehistoric glaciation chiefly occurred in the Northern Hemisphere or in Antarctica.In an attempt to solve this problem, Köhler and his team evaluated the LR04 dataset in a completely different way. The data was fed into a computer model that simulates the growth and melting of the large continental ice sheets. What sets it apart: the model is capable of separating the influence of temperature and that of sea level change on the 18O concentration. Furthermore, it can accurately analyse where and when snow falls and the ice increases -- more in the Northern Hemisphere or in Antarctica. ""Mathematicians call this separation a deconvolution,"" Köhler explains, ""which our model is capable of delivering."" The results show that the sequence of glacials and interglacials was irregular even in the period 2.6 to 1.0 million years ago -- a finding that could be crucial in the coming years. As part of the ongoing major EU project 'BE-OIC (Beyond EPICA Oldest Ice Core)', researchers are drilling deeper than ever before into the Antarctic ice. With the oldest ice core recovered to date, 'EPICA', they have 'only' travelled back roughly 800,000 years into the past. The ancient ice provides, among other things, information on how much carbon dioxide Earth's atmosphere contained at that time. With 'Beyond EPICA' they will delve circa 1.5 million years into the past. By combining the carbon dioxide measurements with Köhler's analyses, valuable insights can be gained into the relation between these two factors -- the fluctuations in the sequence of glacials and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. And this can help us understand the fundamental relationship between greenhouse gases and climate changes in Earth's glacial history.",Climate,2020.0,"A study by physicist Peter Köhler from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) has provided insight into the sequence of glacial and interglacial periods over the last 2.6 million years.

Scientists do this by using statistics to estimate the increase in the probability of that event that is attributable to climate change. Those statistical measures are closely related to the ""false alarm ratio,"" an important metric used to assess the quality of hazardous weather warnings.But there is a second key metric used to assess the performance of weather forecasters, he argues: The probably that the forecast will correctly warn of events that actually occur, known as the ""probability of detection."" The ideal probability of detection score is 100%, while the ideal false-alarm rate would be zero.Probability of detection has mostly been ignored when it comes to linking extreme events to climate change, he says. Yet both weather forecasting and climate change attribution face a tradeoff between the two. In both weather forecasting and climate-change attribution, calculations in the paper show that raising the thresholds to reduce false alarms produces a much greater drop in the probability of detection.Drawing on a hypothetical example of a tornado forecaster whose false alarm ratio is zero, but is accompanied by a low probability of detection, he writes that such an ""overly cautious tornado forecasting strategy might be argued by some to be smart politics in the context of attributing extreme events to global warming, but it is inconsistent with the way meteorologists warn for a wide range of hazardous weather, and arguably with the way society expects to be warned about threats to property and human life.""Why does this matter? The paper concludes by noting: ""If a forecaster fails to warn for a tornado there may be serious consequences and loss of life, but missing the forecast does not make next year's tornadoes more severe. On the other hand, every failure to alert the public about those extreme events actually influenced by global warming facilitates the illusion that humankind has time to delay the actions required to address the source of that warming. Because the residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere is many hundreds to thousands of years the cumulative consequences of such errors can have a very long lifetime.""",Climate,2020.0,"Dale Durran, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, argues that climate science needs to approach extreme weather events in a way similar to how weather forecasters issue warnings for hazardous weather.

This first of its kind research estimates potential releases of mercury from thawing permafrost under high and low carbon emissions scenarios. The researchers predict that by 2200, the mercury emitted into both the atmosphere and water annually by thawing permafrost will compare with current global anthropogenic mercury emissions. That's because higher carbon emissions lead to faster and more atmosphere and water, where it can accumulate in wildlife like fish.","The team's results were published Sept. 16 in ""If we can hit the Paris Accord target, we expect minimal impacts to mercury concentrations in fish and water. If we continue with unconstrained greenhouse gas emissions, however, it is likely that we will see large increases in mercury concentrations,"" said Kevin Schaefer, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and lead researcher on the project. Mercury emissions of these magnitudes could have a global impact. ""What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,"" said Schaefer, ""The mercury emissions from thawing permafrost could persist for centuries, impacting the environment both locally and globally.""In 2018, Schaefer and several of his colleagues found that permafrost soils store nearly twice as much mercury as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined. That work was funded by NASA as part of the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), a major effort to improve understanding of how climate change is affecting Arctic ecosystems, and how those changes ultimately affect people and places in the Arctic and beyond. Now, the researchers have created a model -- which relies in part on data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite -- to predict how mercury emissions from thawing Arctic permafrost will change under different global emissions scenarios.The new paper characterizes the release of mercury from thawing permafrost for high and low carbon emissions scenarios based on two of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The high carbon emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) assumes unconstrained ""business as usual"" emissions, while the low carbon emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) assumes carbon emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement global target of less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels.The results indicate minimal impacts to mercury concentrations in water and fish for the low carbon emissions scenario and large increases for the high carbon emissions scenario. At the global level, the high carbon emissions scenario would significantly increase the amount of mercury released into the atmosphere, where it would persist in the environment for centuries. At a local level, this would result in large increases to mercury concentrations in fish and water in the Yukon River. For the high emissions scenario, mercury concentrations could double in the Yukon River by 2100. The low carbon emissions scenario shows minimal mercury releases to the atmosphere and small changes to mercury concentrations in fish and water. For the low emissions scenario, mercury concentrations would likely increase by only about 14 percent and would not exceed EPA criterion by 2300.""The thaw of permafrost due to climate change may release mercury as well as greenhouse gases like methane. We need to comply with the Paris Accord target of 2 degrees C. Otherwise, under a high emission scenario, a significant portion of mercury will be released to the environment, and it will continue for hundreds of years,"" said Yasin Elshorbany, a co-author on the study from the University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus.The Yukon River is the fifth largest drainage basin in North America and home to one of the world's longest salmon runs.

Previous imaging research had only pointed to layered interactions between carbon and minerals in soils.""If there is an overlooked mechanism that can help us retain more carbon in soils, then that will help our climate,"" said senior author Johannes Lehmann, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science, Soil and Crop Sciences Section, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Angela Possinger Ph.D. '19, who was a graduate student in Lehmann's lab and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech University, is the paper's first author.Since the resolution of the new technique is near atomic scale, the researchers are not certain what compounds they are looking at, but they suspect the carbon found in soils is likely from metabolites produced by soil microbes and from microbial cell walls. ""In all likelihood, this is a microbial graveyard,"" Lehmann said.""We had an unexpected finding where we could see interfaces between different forms of carbon and not just between carbon and minerals,"" Possinger said. ""We could start to look at those interfaces and try to understand something about those interactions.""The technique revealed layers of carbon around those organic interfaces. It also showed that nitrogen was an important player for facilitating the chemical interactions between both organic and mineral interfaces, Possinger said.As a result, farmers may improve soil health and mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration by considering the form of nitrogen in soil amendments, she said.While pursuing her doctorate, Possinger worked for years with Cornell physicists -- including co-authors Lena Kourkoutis, associate professor of applied and engineering physics, and David Muller, the Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Engineering in Applied and Engineering Physics, and the co-director of the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science -- to help develop the multi-step method.The researchers planned to use powerful electron microscopes to focus electron beams down to sub-atomic scales, but they found the electrons modify and damage loose and complex soil samples. As a result, they had to freeze the samples to around minus 180 degrees Celsius, which reduced the harmful effects from the beams.""We had to develop a technique that essentially keeps the soil particles frozen throughout the process of making very thin slices to look at these tiny interfaces,"" Possinger said.The beams could then be scanned across the sample to produce images of the structure and chemistry of a soil sample and its complex interfaces, Kourkoutis said.""Our physics colleagues are leading the way globally to improve our ability to look very closely into material properties,"" Lehmann said.

At each scale, the researchers adjusted their analyses so that population differences did not skew results.Across scales, the scientists found that the weather had nearly no influence. When it was compared with other factors using a statistical metric that breaks down the relative contribution of each factor toward a particular outcome, the weather's relative importance at the county scale was less than 3%, with no indication that a specific type of weather promoted spread over another.In contrast, the data showed the clear influence of human behavior -- and the outsized influence of individual behaviors.

But is there any way we can detect if these changes are occurring at an abnormal rate? What are the consequences of these changes for the organisms affected? An international team of researchers including scientists from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) have developed a method of detecting such developments and tracking how new ecosystems are formed. They have published their findings in the specialist journal,"Changes in the environment are becoming increasingly apparent due to climate change. Temperatures are rising, there is either no rain at all or it falls in severe storms. These changes have an effect on ecosystems and the living conditions of the organisms within them. If the conditions within these ecosystems become too unfavourable for individual organisms, they either migrate or even become extinct. At the same time, new ecological niches arise that other species can populate or new species are created. 'The problem is knowing at which point we can say it's a new ecosystem,' explains Prof. Wolfgang Kießling from the Chair of Palaeoenvironmental Research at FAU. 'We have now developed a method that allows us to distinguish such events from normal background noise.'An ecosystem is considered new by scientists if extremely rapid changes in the range of organisms within it lead to a state that previously did not exist. The speed at which the changes occur is extremely important. Ecosystems are always changing to a certain extent. Significant shifts only occur above a certain limit, for example as caused by human-made climate change. Scientists are now able to precisely determine this limit using statistics.Times of increased change are extremely dynamic and pose special challenges for the species involved. Wolfgang Kießling and his colleagues successfully tested their method on fossil ecosystems from a period ranging over 66 million years and their results are alarming. The risk of extinction during such dynamic periods of change is twice to four times higher than under normal conditions. At the same time, however, there is a greater chance that new species migrate or are created. 'Changes have always occurred in ecosystems and they will continue to do so,' Kießling continues.

Scientists have long known this and tested for it. But now Stanford researchers have identified the trigger that causes naturally occurring uranium to dislodge from sediments and seep into groundwater, pointing to a solution for managing the toxin before it becomes a problem.","In a new regional model that combines aquifer information with soil properties for predicting groundwater quality, the researchers pinpointed the factors associated with uranium contamination. The research, published in Uranium is among the top three harmful, naturally occurring groundwater contaminants in the Central Valley, along with arsenic and chromium. The radioactive, metallic element becomes dangerous when consumed in high quantities, causing kidney damage and increased risk of cancer. It is prevalent within the Central Valley's San Joaquin Valley, and also occurs naturally in semi-arid and arid environments worldwide.Researchers focused on locations in the Central Valley aquifers where groundwater uranium concentrations have been observed to exceed the drinking water standard of 30 micrograms of uranium per liter.""Every aquifer has one or more of these natural contaminants. The question is whether they sit benignly in the sediments or really cause problems by getting into the groundwater,"" said co-author Scott Fendorf, the Huffington Family Professor in Earth system science at the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). ""Water managers can use our findings to forecast solutions before the problems are manifested.""The study focuses on the chemical impacts of groundwater recharge, which is the process of rainfall seeping into soils and moving down into underlying aquifers. As rainwater seeps downward, its chemistry changes as it interacts with the ground environment. Pumping the water back out also influences the dynamics of the aquifer, which can change the chemistry of the system and how elements such as uranium are partitioned between the solids (sediments) and water. If the water picks up more calcium during its travels and also becomes more alkaline, it can attract uranium and contaminate aquifers, the researchers found.""Our work shows that it's not just properties of the aquifer that are impacting uranium, but factors such as clay content and pH of the soil that served as important predictors of groundwater uranium concentrations,"" said lead study author Alandra Lopez, a PhD student in Earth system science.

What is certain is that climate change -- e.g. through warming, acidification, or oxygen depletion -- is already having an impact on this sensitive ecosystem. In addition, the deep sea is under pressure from the growing interest in raw material extraction.Scientists previously assumed that deep-sea basins, which are all characterized by the same low temperature (0-4°C), salinity (about 3.6 per cent), high pressure (300-500bar depending on depth), and very similar sediment, have relatively low -- and also the same -- species diversity. Moreover, most deep-sea studies to date have focused on specific habitats such as hydrothermal vents and saltwater lenses. Until now, there has been a lack of data on the diversity of deep-sea plains, which make up by far the largest portion of the seafloor. 'By using a new approach of combined molecular biology and cultivation-based studies, we found substantial, highly specific local differences in organism communities with little overlap to the organism communities of coastal regions,' said Dr Alexandra Schönle, lead author of the study.Among the life forms, unicellular organisms (protists), which have been mostly overlooked in current deep-sea food web models, dominated. In addition to the calcareous chambered organisms (foraminifera) traditionally considered in studies, whose deposits dominate vast areas of the world ocean, tiny naked protists dominated, including bacterivorous and parasitic flagellates and ciliates, whose diversity significantly exceeded that of multicellular animals. Also surprising was the high proportion of parasitic forms (10 to 20 per cent), which was previously unknown on this scale. Many of them are likely to infect animals such as crustaceans or fish, but others are likely to infect protozoa.'Our results show that organic matter on the deep-sea floor is recycled through different and previously insufficiently considered components of the microbial food web, and then passed on in the food web. This is crucial for our understanding of global carbon flux,' explains Professor Dr Hartmut Arndt. 'Given the significant differences in the biodiversity of the individual deep-sea basins and their importance in the global context, the economic exploitation and foreseeable devastation of individual deep-sea basins and the sparing of other deep-sea basins seems absurd.'",Climate,2021.0,"The deep-sea floor, covering over 60% of Earth's surface, is the largest part of the biosphere, but remains poorly understood.

New research shows that a potentially toxic species of plankton algae that lives both by doing photosynthesis and absorbing food may become an important player in the Arctic Ocean as the future sea ice becomes thinner and thinner.","Microscopic plankton algae, invisible to the naked eye, are the foundation of the marine food web, feeding all the ocean´s living creatures from small crustaceans to large whales. Plankton algae need light and nutrients to produce food by photosynthesis.A thick layer of sea ice -- sometimes covered with snow -- can reduce how much sunlight penetrates into the water and stop the algae getting enough light. However, as the sea ice is becoming thinner and less widespread in the Arctic, more and more light is penetrating into the sea. Does this mean more plankton algae and thus more food for more fish, whales and seabirds in the Arctic? The story is not so simple.More light in the sea will only lead to a higher production of plankton algae if they also have enough nutrients -- and this is often not the case. With the recent increase in freshwater melt from Arctic glaciers and the general freshening of the Arctic Ocean, more and more fresh and nutrient-depleted water is running out into the fjords and further out into the sea. The fresher water lies on top of the more salty ocean and stops nutrients from the deeper layers from mixing up towards the surface where there is light. And it is only here that plankton algae can be active.However, a brand new study published today in the  journal Mixotrophic algae are small, single-celled plankton algae that can perform photosynthesis but also obtain energy by eating other algae and bacteria. This allows them to stay alive and grow even when their photosynthesis does not have enough light and nutrients in the water.In northeast Greenland, a team of researchers measured the production of plankton algae under the sea ice in the high-Arctic fjord Young Sound, located near Daneborg.""We showed that the plankton algae under the sea ice actually produced up to half of the total annual plankton production in the fjord,"" says Dorte H. Søgaard from the Greenland Climate Research Centre, Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and the Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, who headed the study.""Mixotrophic plankton algae have the advantage that they can sustain themselves by eating other algae and bacteria as a supplement to photosynthesis when there isn't enough light. This means that they are ready to perform photosynthesis even when very little light penetrates into the sea. In addition, many mixotrophic algae can live in relatively fresh water and at very low concentrations of nutrients -- conditions that often prevail in the water layers under the sea ice in the spring when the ice melts,"" Dorte H. Søgaard explains.For nine days, the researchers measured an algal bloom driven by mixotrophic algae occurring under the thick but melting sea ice in Young Sound during the Arctic spring in July, as the sun gained more power and more melt ponds spread across the sea ice, gradually letting through more light.The algae belong to a group called haptophytes. Many of these algae are toxic, and in this study they bloomed in quantities similar to those previously observed in the Skagerrak near southern Norway. Here, the toxic plankton algae killed large amounts of salmon in Norwegian fish farms.""We know that haptophytes often appear in areas with low salinity -- as seen in the Baltic Sea, for example. It is therefore very probable that these mixotrophic-driven algae blooms will appear more frequently in a more freshwater-influenced future Arctic Ocean and that this shift in dominant algae to a mixotrophic algae species might have a large ecological and socio-economic impact."" says Dorte H. Søgaard.The researchers behind the project point out that it is the first time that a bloom of mixotrophic algae has been recorded under the sea ice in the Arctic.",Climate,2021.0,"Plankton algae are the foundation of the marine food web, but a thick layer of sea ice can reduce how much sunlight penetrates into the water and stop the algae getting enough light.

Climatic changes including increases in temperature, sunlight, and atmospheric carbon dioxide -- which affect the growth of plants and trees -- have changed natural habitats from tropical shrubland to tropical savannah and deciduous woodland. This created a suitable environment for many bat species that predominantly live in forests.The number of coronaviruses in an area is closely linked to the number of different bat species present. The study found that an additional 40 bat species have moved into the southern Chinese Yunnan province in the past century, harbouring around 100 more types of bat-borne coronavirus. This 'global hotspot' is the region where genetic data suggests SARS-CoV-2 may have arisen.""Climate change over the last century has made the habitat in the southern Chinese Yunnan province suitable for more bat species,"" said Dr Robert Beyer, a researcher in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology and first author of the study, who has recently taken up a European research fellowship at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany.He added: ""Understanding how the global distribution of bat species has shifted as a result of climate change may be an important step in reconstructing the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak.""To get their results, the researchers created a map of the world's vegetation as it was a century ago, using records of temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover. Then they used information on the vegetation requirements of the world's bat species to work out the global distribution of each species in the early 1900s. Comparing this to current distributions allowed them to see how bat 'species richness', the number of different species, has changed across the globe over the last century due to climate change.""As climate change altered habitats, species left some areas and moved into others -- taking their viruses with them. This not only altered the regions where viruses are present, but most likely allowed for new interactions between animals and viruses, causing more harmful viruses to be transmitted or evolve,"" said Beyer.The world's bat population carries around 3,000 different types of coronavirus, with each bat species harbouring an average of 2.7 coronaviruses -- most without showing symptoms. An increase in the number of bat species in a particular region, driven by climate change, may increase the likelihood that a coronavirus harmful to humans is present, transmitted, or evolves there.Most coronaviruses carried by bats cannot jump into humans. But several coronaviruses known to infect humans are very likely to have originated in bats, including three that can cause human fatalities: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV-1 and CoV-2.The region identified by the study as a hotspot for a climate-driven increase in bat species richness is also home to pangolins, which are suggested to have acted as intermediate hosts to SARS-CoV-2. The virus is likely to have jumped from bats to these animals, which were then sold at a wildlife market in Wuhan -- where the initial human outbreak occurred.The researchers echo calls from previous studies that urge policy-makers to acknowledge the role of climate change in outbreaks of viral diseases, and to address climate change as part of COVID-19 economic recovery programmes.""The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous social and economic damage. Governments must seize the opportunity to reduce health risks from infectious diseases by taking decisive action to mitigate climate change,"" said Professor Andrea Manica in the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, who was involved in the study.""The fact that climate change can accelerate the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans should be an urgent wake-up call to reduce global emissions,"" added Professor Camilo Mora at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, who initiated the project.The researchers emphasised the need to limit the expansion of urban areas, farmland, and hunting grounds into natural habitat to reduce contact between humans and disease-carrying animals.The study showed that over the last century, climate change has also driven increases in the number of bat species in regions around Central Africa, and scattered patches in Central and South America.",Climate,2021.0,"Climate change has led to large-scale changes in vegetation in southern China's Yunnan province, Myanmar and Laos over the past century, creating an environment suitable for many bat species that predominantly live in forests.

They are also very hard to measure and so tend to be underrepresented in measurements and models of AGB.""We show the first detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) estimates of the volume and AGB of large coastal redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens) from three sites in Northern California, representing some of the highest biomass ecosystems on Earth.""The research contributes to an aspect of climate change research with increasing focus.Professor Disney add: ""Big questions within climate science in response to rising COEstimating the size and mass of very large trees is an extremely difficult task. Previously, trees could only be weighed by cutting them down or by using other indirect methods such as remote sensing or scaling up from manual measurements of trunk diameter, both of which have potentially large margins of error.Working with colleagues at NASA, and with support from the NASA Carbon Monitoring System programme, the researchers used ground-based laser measurements to create detailed 3D maps of the redwoods. NASA's new space laser mission, GEDI, is mapping forest carbon from space, and the GEDI team are using Professor Disney's work to test and improve the models they use to do this.The trees scanned include the 88-metre tall Colonel Armstrong tree, with a diameter-at-breast height of 3.39 m, which they estimate weighs around 110 tons, the equivalent of almost 10 double-decker buses.The researchers compared the TLS estimates with other methods and found that their estimates correlated with those of 3D crown mapping, a technique pioneered by American botanist Stephen C. Sillett that involves expert climbers scaling giant redwoods to manually record fine details about their height and mass.Professor Disney's team found that their AGB estimates agreed to within 2% of the records from crown mapping. Crucially, they also found that both these 3D methods show that these large trees are more than 30% heavier than current estimates from more indirect methods.The researchers recommend that laser technology and 3D crown mapping could be used to provide complementary, independent 3D measures.Assistant Professor Laura Duncanson (NASA Earth Sciences & University of Maryland), last author on the study and member of the NASA GEDI science team, said: ""Estimating the biomass of large trees is critical to quantifying their importance to the carbon cycle, particularly in Earth's most carbon rich forests.

At the same time, certain land managers have invested huge amounts of time and resources toward restoring fire through ""controlled burn"" approaches.","In the face of heartbreaking losses, effort and expense, scientists are still grappling with some of the most basic questions about how fire influences interactions between plants and animals in the natural world.A new study grounded in the northern Rockies explores the role of fire in the finely tuned dance between plants and their pollinators. Published Nov. 25 in the ""A large number of studies have looked at how fire affects plants, or how fire affects animals. But what is largely understudied is the question of how fire affects both, and about how linkages within those ecological networks might respond to fire disturbance,"" said Jonathan Myers, associate professor of biology in Arts & Sciences at Washington University, a co-author of the study.The researchers discovered that wildfire disturbance and plant-pollinator interactions are both important in determining where plants take root and where pollinators are found. But in burned landscapes, plant-pollinator interactions are generally as important or more important than any other factor in determining the composition of species present.The importance of flowering-plant species in determining the composition of pollinator species doubled to quadrupled following wildfire. In addition, the importance of pollinators in determining plant composition nearly doubled following wildfire.""Clearly, pollinators perform a valuable ecosystem service for humans by pollinating all our crops. In intact natural ecosystems, they perform an equally valuable service,"" said Joseph LaManna, assistant professor of biological sciences at Marquette University, first author of the study. ""What we are seeing is that plant and pollinator linkages become even more important in disturbed or burned landscapes. These connections are important for restoring ecosystems in which natural wildfire regimes have been altered or suppressed by human activities.""And as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, the potential for biodiversity loss -- for losses of individual plant or pollinator species -- is going to be even more profound than we anticipated,"" he said.Wildfire in the northern Rockies can be ignited by lightning -- but more and more, it is started by people.Historically, wildfires tended to burn hot in some spots and cold in others, resulting in a patchwork or mosaic of differing levels of fire disturbance. But with rising global temperatures, the plant debris and other materials that fuel fires are drying out. That trend combined with decades of active fire suppression has resulted in a shift from a majority mixed-severity wildfire regime to today's high-severity blazes.For this study, co-author Laura Burkle at Montana State University led the field inventories of plants and pollinators at 152 plots in Montana representing a wildfire gradient including plots with no recent wildfire (unburned), mixed-severity wildfire and high-severity wildfire. LaManna and Myers worked with Burkle and Travis Belote of The Wilderness Society to analyze the data.At the sites they compared, the scientists found that the number of individual bees, flies and butterflies -- and the flowering plants they frequent -- were higher in parts of the landscape that had burned, as opposed to those that hadn't burned.However, increases were greater in areas that had experienced mixed-severity wildfire, which leaves some vegetation intact in a mosaic of habitat types, as opposed to high-severity wildfire, which largely removes all vegetation and can damage the soil and seed bank.For example, flowering-plant abundances increased more than 10-fold in mixed-severity wildfire and more than nine-fold in high-severity wildfire compared with unburned areas. Overall the researchers identified 329 pollinator species and 193 flowering-plant species.""Oftentimes, the public perception about fire in general is that it is bad. But it was impressive how much higher the abundances of both plants and pollinators were -- as well as the number of species -- in the burned landscapes compared with the unburned landscapes,"" Myers said.Although this study shows that fire increased abundances and species diversity of pollinators and flowering plants overall, the intensity of the fire matters. Hotter, high-severity burns can eliminate landscape features that pollinators require, like stumps or woody debris for nesting. Mixed-severity wildfire is most beneficial.Around the world, pollinator populations are in decline. The northern Rockies are no exception to this troubling trend.""Thanks to this project, we now have very in-depth knowledge of local pollinator communities, especially the bee communities,"" Burkle said. ""One of the benefits of these data is to be able to provide expert knowledge about declining pollinator species and species of concern, like the Western Bumble Bee (""When we think about patterns of biodiversity across space, we typically consider different groups of species separately,"" she said. ""In our case, we might consider patterns of plant diversity separately from patterns of pollinator diversity. But our study provides solid evidence that -- above and beyond the influence of disturbances like wildfires -- the relationships that plants have with pollinators are strong contributors to these patterns of biodiversity.""This means that biotic interactions among species are important and will need to be considered more explicitly in conservation actions, like plans for species range shifts with climate change.""Global climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires in many other regions -- as it has in the mountain West, the researchers said.The findings from this study suggest that this could possibly result in additional losses of vulnerable species.""We may see wildfire accelerating co-extinction events where you lose a pollinator and then you lose all of the plants that the pollinator depended on -- and then you lose more pollinators that were associated with those plants, and so on,"" LaManna said. ""You have a potential for a chain of losses.""Overall, this research advances understanding of how and why wildfire affects conservation, land management and restoration of forest ecosystems. It also shows that ecological models that predict how species will respond under various climate change scenarios also should consider biological interactions within food webs, Myers said.""By sharing our findings with federal land managers across the region, we hope to contribute to management plans, with the dual aim of maintaining biodiversity of plants and pollinators while restoring environmental complexity representative of historical fire regimes,"" Myers said.",Climate,2020.0,"A study published in the journal Ecosphere has explored the role of fire in the relationship between plants and their pollinators.

""The onset of the rainy season has been progressively delayed since the 1960s, and as a result the precipitation season has become shorter and sharper in California.""The new study in AGU's journal The results suggest California's wildfire season, which has been getting progressively worse due to human-caused climate change, will last even longer in the years to come and Californians can expect to see more fires flaring up in the month of November. 2020 was California's worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 10,000 fires burning more than 4.2 million acres of land.An extended dry season means there is more overlap between wildfire season and the influx of Santa Ana winds that bring hot, dry weather to California in the fall. These winds can fan the flames of wildfires and increase the risk of late-season fires getting out of hand.""It's not just a matter of making the vegetation drier and keeping all else equal,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study. ""You're also increasing the number of opportunities for extremely dry vegetation and extremely strong offshore winds to coincide.""The delay in the start of the rainy season is likely due to changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns that bring precipitation to the West Coast, according to the study authors. They found the atmospheric circulation pattern that dominates California during the summer is extending into fall across the north Pacific Ocean. This change is bringing more rain to the states of Washington and Oregon and leaving California high and dry.The changes mean Californians will need to better plan how they manage water resources and energy production -- a longer dry season means more irrigation is needed for crops in an already water-stressed state.""All water-sensitive stakeholders should have this information and plan their management accordingly,"" Lukovi? said.",Climate,2021.0,"A new study shows that California's rainy season is starting 27 days later than it did in the 1960s, and the rain that does fall is being concentrated in January and February.

Their work is the subject of a study published recently in ","Working under the auspices of the Oceans Melting Greenland mission for the past five years, the researchers used ships and aircraft to survey 226 glaciers in all sectors of one of Earth's largest islands. They found that 74 glaciers situated in deep, steep-walled valleys accounted for nearly half of Greenland's total ice loss between 1992 and 2017.Such fjord-bound glaciers were discovered to be the most subject to undercutting, a process by which warm, salty water at the bottom of the canyons melts the ice from below, causing the masses to break apart more quickly than usual. In contrast, the team found that 51 glaciers positioned in shallower gullies experienced less undercutting and contributed only about 15 percent of the total ice loss.""I was surprised by how lopsided it was. The biggest and deepest glaciers are undercut much faster than the smaller glaciers in shallow fjords,"" said lead author Michael Wood, a post-doctorate researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, who began this research as a doctoral student at UCI. ""In other words, the biggest glaciers are the most sensitive to the warming waters and those are the ones really driving Greenland's ice loss.""The study highlighted the dynamic whereby deeper fjords allow the intrusion of warmer ocean water than shallow ones, hastening the process of undercutting with some of Greenland's largest glaciers.Greenland is home to one of Earth's only two ice sheets, the largest being Antarctica's. The ice in Greenland is more than two miles (three kilometers) thick in places. At the edges of the land mass, the vast glaciers extending from the ice sheet travel slowly down valleys like icy conveyor belts, which inch into the fjords and then melt or break off as icebergs. The ice is replenished by snowfall that is compressed over time into the ice pack.If the ice sheet were in balance, the amount of snow accumulating on the top would roughly equal the ice lost from melt, evaporation and calving -- chunks breaking free from anchored masses and floating off into the ocean.But the ice sheet has been out of balance since the 1990s. Melt has accelerated and calving has increased, causing glaciers that extend into the sea to retreat back toward land. Together, these are resulting the ice sheet shrinkage.According to the research team, the build-up of warm salty water at the bottom of fjords has been accelerated by increasing temperatures in the summer months, which heat the surfaces of glaciers, creating pools of meltwater. This liquid leaks through cracks in the ice to form subsurface freshwater rivers which flows into the sea where it interacts with salty water beneath fjords.Glacier meltwater is free of salt, so it is lighter than seawater and rises to the surface as a plume, dragging up warm water and putting it in contact with the bottoms of glaciers. Fjord depth is a fairly immutable factor, but other factors such as seawater temperature and the amount of meltwater from glaciers surfaces are greatly impacted by climate warming. All three factors combine to cause accelerated deterioration of Greenland's ice sheet, the researchers said.As the water temperature around Greenland's coastline is predicted to continue to increase in the future, these findings suggest that some climate models may underestimate glacial ice loss by at least a factor of two if they do not account for undercutting by a warm ocean.The study also lends insight into why many of Greenland's glaciers never recovered after an abrupt ocean warming between 1998 and 2007, which caused an increase in ocean temperature by nearly 2 degrees Celsius. Although ocean warming paused between 2008 and 2017, the glaciers had already experienced such extreme undercutting in the previous decade that they continued to retreat at an accelerated rate.""We have known for well over a decade that the warmer ocean plays a major role in the evolution of Greenland glaciers,"" said OMG deputy principal investigator Eric Rignot, also of JPL and UCI. ""But for the first time, we have been able to quantify the undercutting effect and demonstrate its dominant impact on the glacier retreat over the past 20 years.""",Climate,2021.0,"Glaciers in deep, steep-walled valleys are the most susceptible to melting from below by warm, salty water, according to a study by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Work led by Phillip Cleves -- who joined Carnegie's Department of Embryology this fall -- details how the revolutionary, Nobel Prize-winning technology can be deployed to guide conservation efforts for fragile reef ecosystems.","Cleves' research team's findings were recently published in two papers in the Corals are marine invertebrates that build extensive calcium carbonate skeletons from which reefs are constructed. But this architecture is only possible because of a mutually beneficial relationship between the coral and various species of single-celled algae that live inside individual coral cells. These algae convert the Sun's energy into food using a process called photosynthesis and they share some of the nutrients they produce with their coral hosts -- kind of like paying rent.Coral reefs have great ecological, economic, and aesthetic value. Many communities depend on them for food and tourism. However, human activity is putting strain on coral reefs including warming oceans, pollution, and acidification and that affects this symbiotic relationship.""In particular, increasing ocean temperatures can cause coral to lose their algae, a phenomenon called bleaching, because the coral takes on a ghostly white look in the absence of the algae's pigment,"" Cleves explained. ""Without the nutrients provided by photosynthesis, the coral can die of starvation.""In 2018, Cleves headed up the team that demonstrated the first use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing on coral. Now, his teams used CRISPR/Cas9 to identify a gene responsible for regulating coral's response to heat stress.Working first in the anemone Aiptasia, one team -- including Stanford University's Cory Krediet, Erik Lehnert, Masayuki Onishi, and John Pringle -- identified a protein, called Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), which activates many genes associated with the response to heat stress. Anemones are close coral relatives that have similar symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae, but they grow faster and are easier to study. These traits make Aiptasia a powerful model system to study coral biology in the lab.Then another Cleves-led team -- including Stanford University's Amanda Tinoco and John Pringle, Queensland University of Technology's Jacob Bradford and Dimitri Perrin, and Line Bay of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) -- used CRISPR/Cas9 to create mutations in the gene that encodes HSF1 in the coral Acropora millepora, demonstrating its importance for coping with a warming environment. Without a functioning HSF1 protein, the coral died rapidly when the surrounding water temperature increased.""Understanding the genetic traits of heat tolerance of corals holds the key to understanding not only how corals will respond to climate change naturally but also balancing the benefits, opportunities and risks of novel management tools,"" said Bay, who is the AIMS principal research scientist and head of its Reef Recovery, Restoration and Adaptation team.Added Cleves: ""Our work further demonstrates how CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to elucidate aspects of coral physiology that can be used to guide conservation. This time we focused on one particular heat tolerance gene, but there are so many more mechanisms to reveal in order to truly understand coral biology and apply this knowledge to protecting these important communities.""",Climate,2020.0,"Coral reefs are built from calcium carbonate skeletons and rely on a mutually beneficial relationship with single-celled algae that live within them.

Finnish researchers have now revised the crucial part of the existing stratigraphic documentation in southern Finland. The new findings show that a considerable part of the warm interval records extends further back in time than earlier thought. The new results change the established conceptions about glacial history in the area.","The new study conducted at the University of Turku has examined geological stratigraphic sequences in southern and central Finland. The material collected during the study was compared with corresponding stratigraphic sequences in Fennoscandia, the Baltic countries and Europe.- One of the studied warm interval records may be circa 300,000-400,000 years old. The forests in South Finland were then composed of scots pine and Norway spruce and contained larch, fir and possibly some species related to present-day Strobus pine, says Professor of Geology Matti E. Räsänen.A major part of the revised warm interval records is, however, attributed to the Röpersdorf-Schöningen interglacial circa 200,000 years ago. The study led by Räsänen has, for the first time, managed to reconstruct the paleogeography, vegetation and climate of this regional interglacial in Fennoscandia. During this interglacial period, the ocean levels were nearly 20m lower than today, and the Gulf of Bothnia hosted fresh water lakes surrounded by boreal pine forests.- This is why Finland had a continental climate with warmer summers and colder winters than today. The forests were dominated by scots pine and the Siberian spruce was growing even in southern Finland. Several species that nowadays grow on the East European Plain and in Southeast Europe were growing in southern Finland, explains Räsänen.During the Eemian interglacial 119,000-131,000 years ago, ocean levels were four to six metres higher than today and the Baltic basin was well connected to oceans.- The dinoflagellate, silicoflagellate and diatom microfossils discovered from the stratigraphic sequences show detailed evidence of the widespread intermixing of continental fresh and marine waters within the shallow Eemian sea coastal waters.Most importantly, the research results change the established conceptions about the nature of the temperate Brörup interval in the beginning of the last Weichselian glacial cycle circa 100,000 years ago. The findings from Björkö Island in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Kvarken Archipelago suggest that during this interval, central and southern Finland supported open birch forest tundra, which was later invaded by spruce, but not boreal pine forests as earlier thought.- The northern limit of pine forests seems to have been located at the Gulf of Riga in the Balticum. The climate in southern Finland was thus considerably cooler than thought.

In these cases, the shoreline will retreat, but the beaches are still likely to remain, albeit a little raised in elevation and located landward, and will certainly not go 'extinct'.The new paper says there is currently no information available globally on the number of beaches which fall into either category and, as such, it is impossible to quantify what proportion of the world's beaches will disappear between now and 2100.Andrew Cooper, Professor of Coastal Studies at Ulster University and the new paper's lead author, said: ""New methods are needed for predicting impacts of sea-level rise on the coast. This will require better datasets of coastal morphology and improved understanding of the mechanisms of shoreline response in given settings. As sea level rises, shoreline retreat must, and will, happen but beaches will survive. The biggest threat to the continued existence of beaches is coastal defence structures that limit their ability to migrate.""Co-author Professor Gerd Masselink, from the University of Plymouth's Coastal Processes Research Group, led a study earlier this year which found that island 'drowning' is not inevitable as sea levels rise.He added: ""Sea level is currently rising and will continue to rise at an increasing rate for many years to come. This will lead to more coastal erosion and it is crucial that we anticipate the future loss of land and take this into account in coastal management and planning to avoid putting more buildings and coastal infrastructure in harm's way. In the UK, Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMAs) are becoming increasingly important as a planning tool. CCMAs are areas that are likely to be affected by coastal change in the future and development in these areas should be avoided. This will then enable the coastline to respond naturally to sea-level rise, preventing coastal squeeze and loss of beaches.""Coastal structures such as seawalls prevent beaches from naturally adjusting to rising sea levels by migrating landward and in those settings, removal of the structures (managed realignment) or nature-based solutions (beach nourishment) may be the only methods to safeguard the future of these beaches.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has disputed the claim that half the world's beaches could disappear by the end of the century due to climate change.

Imagine a parcel of air that rushes over mountains, plunges toward cool valleys, shuttles across land and sea and ricochets off growing storms, bobbing up and down between layers of stable atmosphere in a great tug of war between buoyancy and gravity. A single wave can travel for thousands of miles, carrying momentum and heat along the way.Although lesser known than gravitational waves -- undulations in the fabric of space-time -- atmospheric gravity waves are ubiquitous and powerful, said Stanford University atmospheric scientist Aditi Sheshadri, senior author of a new study detailing changes in high-frequency gravity waves across seasons and latitudes. They cause some of the turbulence felt on airplanes flying in clear skies and have a strong influence on how storms play out at ground level.Published Aug. 30 in the ""This was just a very lucky thing because they weren't collecting data for any scientific mission. But, incidentally, they happened to be measuring position and temperature and pressure,"" said Sheshadri, who is an assistant professor of Earth system science at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth).The researchers calculated gravity wave motions from data that balloons collected over 6,811 separate 48-hour periods from 2014 to 2018. ""To mount an equivalent scientific campaign would be terribly expensive. With the Loon data, the analysis is messier because the data collection was incidental, but it has near-global coverage,"" Sheshadri said.Gravity waves are an important part of atmospheric dynamics. ""They help to drive the overall circulation of the atmosphere, but some gravity waves are too small and too frequent to be observed with satellites,"" said the study's lead author, Erik Lindgren, who worked on the research as a postdoctoral scholar in Sheshadri's lab. ""These are the gravity waves we have focused on in this study."" Earlier studies using atmospheric balloons to track high-frequency gravity waves have typically incorporated data from no more than a few dozen balloon flights, covering smaller areas and fewer seasons.The Loon data proved particularly valuable for calculating high-frequency gravity waves, which can rise and fall hundreds of times in a day, over distances ranging from a few hundred feet to hundreds of miles. ""They're tiny and they change on timescales of minutes. But in an integrated sense, they affect, for instance, the momentum budget of the jet stream, which is this massive planetary scale thing that interacts with storms and plays an important role in setting their course,"" Sheshadri said.Gravity waves also influence the polar vortex, a swirl of frigid air that usually hovers over the North Pole and can blast extreme cold into parts of Europe and the United States for months at a time. And they interact with the quasi-biennial oscillation, in which, roughly every 14 months, the belt of winds blowing high over the equator reverses direction -- with big impacts on ozone depletion and surface weather far beyond the tropics.As a result, understanding gravity waves is key to improving weather forecasts at the regional scale, especially as global warming continues to disrupt historical patterns. ""Getting gravity waves right would help constrain circulation responses to climate change, like how much it's going to rain in a particular location, the number of storms -- dynamical things such as wind and rain and snow,"" Sheshadri said.Current climate models estimate the effects of high-frequency gravity waves on circulation in a kind of black box, with few constraints from real-world observations or application of the limited existing knowledge of the physical processes at play. ""Until now, it has not been entirely clear how these waves behave in different regions or over the seasons at very high frequencies or small scales,"" Lindgren said.Sheshadri and colleagues focused on energy associated with high-frequency gravity waves at different time scales, and how that energy varies across seasons and latitudes. They found these waves are larger and build up more kinetic energy in the tropics and during the summer; smaller waves moving with less energy are more common close to the poles and during the winter. They also found gravity waves changing in sync with the phases of the quasi-biennial oscillation. ""We uncovered distinct shifts in gravity wave activity at different times of the year and over different parts of the globe,"" Lindgren said. ""As to exactly why is not clear.""In future research, Sheshadri aims to identify which gravity wave sources are responsible for these differences, and to extrapolate gravity wave amplitudes at very high frequencies from relatively infrequent observations. She said, ""Understanding how gravity waves drive circulation in the atmosphere, the interaction between these waves and the mean flow -- it's really the next frontier in understanding atmospheric dynamics.""",Climate,2020.0,"Atmospheric gravity waves, which are ripples in the air caused by blobs of air being forced upwards and then pulled down by gravity, are ubiquitous and powerful.

Alterations in marine species distributions in response to warming and sea ice reduction are likely to increase the susceptibility and vulnerability of Arctic ecosystems. The findings, published by Hokkaido University researchers in the journal Fisheries oceanographer Irene Alabia of Hokkaido University's Arctic Research Center along with colleagues in Japan and the US investigated how future climate changes will impact the marine biodiversity in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. These seas extend from Alaska to Russia in the northern Pacific and southern Arctic oceans.""This area forms a 'biogeographical transition zone': a biodiversity-rich region covering two distinct areas with specific features that encourage the coexistence of species living at or close to their distribution limits,"" explains Alabia. ""These zones are vulnerable to climate warming, and climatic disruptions can create favorable conditions for the shift of warm-water species into previously colder-water zones.""Scientists are interested in understanding how species in biogeographical transition zones are responding to climate changes and other human impacts. This information could help in conservation planning, fisheries management, and in studying the role of evolutionary history in shaping currently existing communities.Alabia and her team mapped the present and future spatial distributions of 26 fish and invertebrate species in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Using species records, sea surface temperature, and sea ice concentration data, the authors developed species distribution models to predict the distributional ranges under the present-day (1993-2017) and future (2026-2100) climate conditions. From the model outputs, the changes in species richness and compositional diversity in terms of species' phylogeny and functional traits between time periods and across contrasting levels of warming were elucidated.The findings suggest that larger, longer-lived and more predatory fish and invertebrates will expand their ranges towards the pole in response to warming waters and sea ice free conditions by the end of the 21st century. These poleward shifts could alter the structure, composition and functions of future Arctic communities, which are currently dominated by smaller and short-lived species. The future species pool in the Arctic waters will also have more similar functions within the ecosystem, impacting regional food webs. It is also likely that there will be considerable socioeconomic impacts, as commercially important species shift northwards, which could increase operational fishing costs.""These projected impacts are expected to raise challenges for ocean governance, conservation and resource management of shifting fisheries,"" says Alabia.

Although the ACG's protected status has effectively eliminated certain threats to biodiversity loss, such as fire, hunting, deforestation, and pesticide use, the creatures that dwell there are not exempt from what Janzen and Hallwachs call the ""heterogenous blanket"" of climate change effects.""What we have seen and lived since the mid-1970s, unambiguously, in our Costa Rican tropical wild world is that the biomass and species richness of insect individuals and species, and their interactions with everything, are decomposing,"" they write.To respond to this decline, the scientists have focused their efforts locally. Keeping track of the effects of climate change through consistent monitoring is essential, they say, but what even more critical is engaging the people who own the preserved land: all five million Costa Ricans, in this case. Janzen and Hallwachs are internationally known for their work on this front, having created a model in ACG that empowers and employs local people in conservation work and attempts to facilitate the movement of these processes throughout the national park system and abroad.In their article, the researchers describe a new approach to expand on these successes: BioAlfa, a nationwide program designed to enlist Costa Ricans themselves in hands-on learning and research about their nation's wild ecosystems. The initiative's name comes from the Spanish for bioliterate, ""bioalfabetizado.""""The tradition in tropical countries is that when you want to know something about the biology of your country, expeditions from the North come and do studies of one sort or another and then they take the information home with them,"" Janzen and Hallwachs say. ""What we said is, 'Look, you're capable of doing this all yourselves. You can find all the bugs and the plants and the birds and everything in your own country and, in the process, learn about them.'""Janzen and Hallwachs never intended to explicitly study climate change. But its effects have been impossible to ignore. They note that in the 1980s cloud cover was a constant presence over the aptly named cloud forests of ACG, shrouding peaks like Volcán Orosí and Volcán Cacao. Yet the cloud layer shrank by the 1990s and now,many days pass with no cloud cover whatsoever. The result is a drying of forest ecosystems to the detriment of insects and other wildlife that thrive in damp leaf litter and moist conditions, to say nothing of the drying waterways that used to adequately irrigate flatland crops and other development.The ACG now experiences far more days of temperatures that approach and exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit than it did in past decades. In addition, a prolonged dry season and greater irregularities in rainfall amount and timing compound the stresses on the biodiversity that lives there. Essentially all tropical organisms use weather cues to guide their lives, and when these change and fracture everyone takes a hit.Janzen and Hallwachs note that these climatic perturbations have extracted a price on insect biodiversity, a bellwether for impacts on the food web bottom to top. In their report, they compare photos from moth surveys -- conducted at night by using a bright light to attract moths to a light-colored sheet, where they can be counted -- that indicate a dramatic drop in both moth numbers and species diversity since the 1980s.Looking at a different types of insects, they say that, despite a constant search effort by ACG's on-the-ground staff of trained and experienced neighbor researchers, the overall number of caterpillars found during regular surveys has fallen in half since 2005, a clear sign of decline.Supporting this finding, when caterpillars are found, they are now less likely to be parasitized by another insect species. About a fifth of caterpillars were found parasitized in 1985; that has fallen to just 5% in recent years. While this may be a good thing for individual caterpillars, it's a worrying sign overall. Because parasites are hyperspecialized to associate with particular caterpillar species, Janzen says that this lack of parasitized caterpillars suggests that caterpillar numbers are so few that the parasites are unable to locate their desired species and maintain their populations.""When caterpillar density goes down, the parasites go extinct faster,"" Janzen says. ""So now you've lost that carnivore. And you repeat that a thousand times, 10,000 times.""Mitigating climate change can be an overwhelming task, and Janzen says that ""little guys"" -- like the economically-small but biodiversity-big country of Costa Rica -- are unlikely to make a big-picture impact, except by example. In his eyes, it's essential for small tropical nations to focus energy on creating the conditions that enable the survivors of climate change to maintain a foothold. And that is where BioAlfa comes in.While international conservation groups contribute money to preserve land in lush, biodiverse locales, such as ACG, the researchers argue that gaining buy-in from all levels of the owners of that preserved land, rather than outsiders who may never step foot in the country, is a necessary ingredient in tropical conservation.""Charismatic vertebrates, tourist snapshots, and marketable big tree trunks are not even 0.001% of tropical biodiversity,"" Janzen and Hallwachs write. ""The millions to billions of species, and billions of wild interactions still viable, are largely invisible without bioliteracy.""That's why underscoring bioliteracy is the foundation of BioAlfa. The Penn scientists' vision is that, just as elementary school children are taught to read, they should also be taught about the biodiversity around them, and not just in a classroom but by going on the land and learning by doing. And like reading, this knowledge becomes something one takes into whatever social sector becomes home.This enhanced bioliteracy would then feed back into conservation, they say. Not only might a greater understanding of ecosystems among Costa Ricans translate into greater appreciation but concrete results by using biodiversity information wherever they are. Specifically, Janzen and Hallwachs want to expand the practice of having local researchers carry out their DNA barcoding work, in which species are identified by sequencing stretches of their genetic material.While the Costa Rican government has committed to the idea of BioAlfa, fully fleshing it out over 10 years will take an estimated $100 million, a hefty sum that Janzen and Hallwachs hope can come from both international governmental and private sources.""Right now Costa Rica has the political permission for this project, but it also needs the financial permission,"" says Janzen.For their part, the couple continues to plug away at building their biodiversity inventory and studies in ACG, while sharing their successes at international meetings (for now virtually), hoping that other tropical nations will follow in their footsteps, protecting land to, in the words of their scientific paper, ""be kind to the survivors"" of climate change.As soon as they're vaccinated for the coronavirus, Janzen and Hallwachs plan to be back on the ground in Costa Rica, continuing to pursue that goal.Daniel Janzen is professor of biology and Thomas G. and Louise E.

You can't miss it -- the vast tundra territory covers almost a million square miles of northern Canada. Relatively few people call this lake-scattered landscape home, but the region plays a crucial role in understanding global climate change. New research from Soren Brothers, assistant professor in the Department of Watershed Sciences and Ecology Center, details how lakes in Nunavut could have a big impact on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, and it's not all bad news -- at least for now. Brothers examined 23 years of data from lakes near Rankin Inlet. He noted a peculiarity -- as the lakes warmed, their carbon dioxide concentrations fell. Most lakes are natural sources of carbon dioxide, but these lakes were now mostly near equilibrium with the atmosphere.","This was odd. The expected pattern is that warmer temperatures should trigger larger releases of greenhouse gases from lakes. In places like Alaska, centuries of accumulated plant material in the permafrost release a hoard of carbon as they thaw, and are consumed by microbes. Experiments have also shown that as waters warm, carbon dioxide production by microbes increases more quickly than carbon dioxide uptake by plants, throwing the system out of balance. Together, these processes should increase atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions from waterways, in theory anyway. So why not in Nunavut? There is no question that the first step in this Rube Goldberg machine is engaged ... the climate is warming. Why then, are the lakes near Rankin Inlet not belching out carbon?Pulling on good, thick parkas, Brothers and his team visited the lakes and came up with a few ideas as to why this is happening. First, they note that much of Nunavut is on the Canadian shield -- an ancient granitic bedrock where thin soils are unlikely to contain -- and thus release -- the massive stores of organic matter entering waterways elsewhere in the Arctic. Second, longer ice-free seasons might be changing the water chemistry and biology in ways that actually lower carbon dioxide concentrations, including longer growing seasons for plants (which take up carbon dioxide), and potentially better growing conditions for algae on the bottom of these shallow, clear lakes.Does this mean that nature has come to the climate rescue? Likely not -- other lakes around the world may still increase carbon dioxide emissions with warming, and the lakes in Nunavut might eventually catch up with them too. More likely, Brothers suggests that the link between ice cover duration and carbon dioxide concentrations might be buying us some time, before stronger positive feedbacks are unleashed between the planet's warming and its ecosystems. It may be a complicated process, but understanding this complexity helps scientists predict variations in how lakes are responding to -- and influencing -- climate change. It's a view under the hood, making planetary feedbacks and tipping points a little more predictable. While the long-term trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions from lakes is not settled, these results are an important piece of the puzzle in climate change science.",Climate,2021.0,"Despite the expectation that warmer temperatures should increase greenhouse gas emissions from lakes, researchers have found that lakes near Rankin Inlet in Nunavut, Canada are not releasing carbon.

An abrupt transition to low-energy subtidal lime mudstone records widespread marine flooding associated with a long-lived regional rise in sea level, they concluded. Relative sea level rise, they added, resulted from long-term tectonically controlled subsidence.The combined evidence from paleontology, ichnology and process sedimentology ""provides a clear record of freshwater input and brackish water conditions due to mixing of freshwater and seawater in a humid climate with high annual precipitation,"" O'Connell's team wrote.The second paper, published Dec. 5 and led by Gardner, documents tidal sediments of the same age on the opposite side of the same ancient tidal strait. The sediments accumulated where strong daily reversing currents swept north and south along the axis of the tidal strait, driving migration of large subtidal dunes and depositing large scale cross-bedded carbonate sands.The authors argue that the migrating dune bedforms could not have formed by tidal like processes in a lake, as some scientists have proposed. The team's results indicate that, after late Miocene to early Pliocene deposition, the sediments were uplifted to elevations up to 330 meters above sea level in the Chocolate Mountains, as a result of long-term crustal strain related to motion on the San Andreas fault.""Taken together, our new papers provide conclusive evidence that the southern Bouse Formation formed in and around the margins of a marine tidal strait that filled the lower Colorado River valley prior to arrival of the modern river system,"" said Dorsey, a professor in the UO's Department of Earth Sciences.A map of the southern Bouse tidal seaway, reconstructed with data from both studies, shows that desert communities from Blythe to Palo Verde, California, were submerged under shallow seas with strong fluctuating tidal currents during late Miocene to early Pliocene time.The Miocene, a geological epoch, lasted from 23 million years ago to 5.3 million years ago; the Pliocene occurred between 5.3 million and 2.6 million years ago.Co-authors with O'Connell and Dorsey on the first paper were Stephen T. Hasiotis, a geologist at the University of Kansas, and Ashleigh Hood at the University of Melbourne.In 2018, another Dorsey-led paper in the journal ",Climate,2020.0,"Two new studies, led by researchers at the University of Oregon, provide evidence that the lower valley of the Colorado River was submerged under shallow seas with strong tidal currents around 5 to 6 million years ago. Layers of sedimentary rocks containing marine fossils and diagnostic sedimentary structures suggest a rise in sea level that drowned alluvial fans and caused tidal waters to invade the valley prior to the arrival of the Colorado River. The studies, which were funded by the National Science Foundation, were published in the journal Geosphere. The researchers argue that their findings provide conclusive evidence of a marine tidal strait that filled the lower Colorado River valley",,

But scientists are only beginning to understand how the effects of multiple droughts can compound to affect forests differently than a single drought alone.,"UC Santa Barbara forest ecologist Anna Trugman -- along with her colleagues at the University of Utah, Stanford University and the U.S. Forest Service -- investigated the effects of repeated, extreme droughts on various types of forests across the globe. They found that a variety of factors can increase and decrease a forest's resilience to subsequent droughts. However, the study, published in Droughts usually leave individual trees more vulnerable to subsequent droughts. ""Compounding extreme events can be really stressful on forests and trees,"" said Trugman, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography. She compares the experience to a person battling an illness: You'll be harder hit if you get sick again while you're still recovering.That said, the case is not quite so clear cut. ""Theoretically, responses to subsequent droughts could be quite varied depending on a wide range of tree-level and ecosystem-level factors,"" said lead author William Anderegg, an assistant professor at the University of Utah. So, while a drought may place a tree under considerable stress, it could also kill off some of its neighbors, leaving the survivors with less competition for water should arid conditions return.Trugman and her colleagues used a variety of data sources to investigate this effect on a broad scale. Tree ring data spanning over 100 years enabled them to see how trees that survived an initial drought grew afterward. Data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis gave them access to metrics on tree mortality for more than 100,000 forest plots from 2000 through 2018. They combined these sources with satellite measurements of the water content in forest canopies.Two clear tends emerged. ""We found that generally trees seem to become more vulnerable to stress after multiple droughts, especially conifers,"" Anderegg said.The second finding, the researchers believe, comes down to basic physiology. Conifers and their kin have different vascular systems than broadleaf trees, or ""angiosperms."" As a result, they may sustain more damage in an initial drought and be at a disadvantage compared to angiosperms during subsequent periods of drought stress. The tree ring data bears this out, showing that conifers that survived a drought grew much more slowly, especially if another drought settled in.""By contrast, angiosperms have much more flexible anatomy and physiology, and this seems to help them recover faster and more fully after initial droughts,"" Anderegg said.Anderegg was particularly surprised by the impact repeated drought had on the Amazon Rainforest. ""We tend to think of these forests as not very impacted by drought and, due to their high tree diversity, able to recover quickly,"" he said. ""But our results indicate the Amazon has been hit hard by three very severe droughts in the past 15 years.""Forests are complex systems, and a variety of factors ultimately dictate how they respond to extreme events. ""In terms of damage you need to not only think about it at the individual level, but at the forest level as well,"" said Trugman. So, although they will need time to recover from an extreme drought, surviving trees will face less competition for water resources than they had before. This could leave them in a better situation if drought returns to the area.What's more, natural selection will drive the forest as a whole to transition toward more resilient individuals, or even to more drought tolerant species overall. Repeated droughts affect forest pests and pathogens as well, and their response to these conditions will also influence how forests behave.Scientists are still working to untangle the conditions under which each of these factors rises to the top. ""This [study] provides a lot of motivation,"" said Trugman, ""but I think the next pressing step is to get at the underlying mechanisms at a physiological level and ecological level.""Researchers can use these insights to improve computer models and make more accurate forecasts about the future of forests in a changing climate. ""Climate change is going to bring more frequent droughts,"" Anderegg said, ""so we have to understand and be able to forecast how forests will respond to multiple droughts.""These results are especially crucial in the western U.S.,"" he added, ""where we've had a number of major droughts in the past 20 years.",Climate,2020.0,"A study by forest ecologists from UC Santa Barbara, the University of Utah, Stanford University, and the U.S. Forest Service has found that repeated droughts leave individual trees more vulnerable to subsequent droughts.

As the climate warms, shrubs expand towards higher latitudes and altitudes. Researcher Julia Kemppinen together with her colleagues investigated the impacts of dwarf shrubs on tundra soils in the sub-Arctic Fennoscandia.","The study revealed that the dominance of dwarf shrubs impacts soil microclimate and carbon stocks. Microclimate describes the moisture and temperature conditions close to ground surface. Shrubs are the largest plant life form in the Arctic, and in comparison, to other arctic plants, shrubs use more water and cast more shade.""The results indicate that the dominance of dwarf shrubs decreases soil moisture, soil temperatures and soil organic carbon stocks,"" says Kemppinen.Due to climate change, the dominance of dwarf shrubs has increased in the Fennoscandian tundra, especially the evergreen crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). While in other parts of the Arctic, larger deciduous shrubs have increased. This expansion is called shrubification.The carbon cycle links shrubification back to global climate change. When the dominance of shrubs increases, less carbon is stored in the soils compared to other plant communities. The soil carbon stocks are important, because they store carbon that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere.""Arctic soils store about half of the global belowground organic carbon pool. If the carbon stocks decrease as the conditions in the Arctic are changing, this may feedback to global climate wawrming. Therefore, everyone should know what is going on in the Arctic,"" says researcher Anna-Maria Virkkala.Investigating the connections between shrubs and soils requires a lot of data.

This surprising consequence of climate change could affect the survival of fish species in the Arctic's offshore waters.,"The study's researchers discovered that thawing permafrost causes groundwater to run deeper, where it becomes cooler than when it flows near the soil surface.Rising global temperatures are causing frozen Arctic soil -- permafrost -- to thaw. In a new study, researchers have discovered something surprising: small rivers, creeks and streams that flow into larger lakes and coastal waters seem be to getting colder as permafrost melts. The phenomenon was previously documented in Russian rivers in the Arctic. But until now, no one had studied why the water was getting colder, even as air temperatures are warming and the permafrost is thawing.Together with researchers from the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center, Associate Professor Ylva Sjöberg of UCPH's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management has shed new light on this cold water. The study's researchers discovered that thawing permafrost causes groundwater to run deeper, where it becomes cooler than when it flows near the soil surface.""Permafrost is found just beneath the ground's surface. When permafrost is intact, groundwater flows from springs and the mountains and atop the permafrost layer, where it is significantly heated throughout summer. However, as permafrost disappears, runoff seeps deeper into the ground, where it cools before making its way into nearby streams, rivers and lakes,"" explains Ylva Sjöberg, the study's lead author.In their study, the researchers studied the Noatak National Preserve in northwest Alaska. As with other Arctic areas, the Noatak is experiencing higher temperature due to climate change.However, very little data is available for how climate change affects the temperature of smaller water flows. The researchers positioned 62 measuring sensors in different streams in areas both with and without permafrost. Here, they observed that water temperatures were warmer in permafrost-covered areas.Using a computer model, the researchers were able to calculate that the summer water temperatures would average 11 degrees in areas of permafrost, while in areas without permafrost, it would be 4 degrees.""We have no reason to believe that our observations in Alaska would be any different in other Arctic regions with analogous landscapes. This complicates the effects of climate change, as it seems that areas with permafrost are not subject to the same simple ratio of temperature increases in air and water as are used elsewhere,"" explains Ylva Sjöberg.Salmon, grayling and sculpin are a few of the fish species that spawn and grow in these streams. Fish biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Alaska Science Center made initial observations of how cooler water temperatures might affect fish.""Stream temperature ultimately determines a fish's ability to reproduce and survive. We suspect that colder water may limit how large a fish grows and likely limits whether they will thrive,"" explains Michael P. Carey, USGS fish biologist.According to the biologists, who are now busy with analysing the study data, thawing permafrost can also introduce other factors that may disturb the aquatic environments of these fish.""Streams draining from areas of thawing permafrost will likely show not only temperature fluctuations but also an increase in carbon and nutrient runoff,"" concludes Carey.",Climate,2021.0,"Thawing permafrost in the Arctic is causing smaller rivers and streams to become colder, according to a study by researchers from the University of Copenhagen and the US Geological Survey Alaska Science Center.

This could be because farmers are better prepared to frighten off elephants. It could also be because landcover change makes it harder for elephants to hide in forest patches, and this spread of farmland and loss of forest to illegal charcoal clearing means that more of the crop-raiding incidents are taking place closer to the protected area.Professor Smith said: 'Landcover change has had a major impact on where human-elephant conflict takes place. Better land-use planning and support for farmers would help reduce crop-raiding as well as people's tolerance of elephants.'Lydia Tiller said: 'The change in crop-raiding trends going from being highly seasonal during 1999-2000 when maize crops are ripe, to year-round during 2014-2015, is yet another demonstration of how climate change is affecting nature.

But the ""wrong-way"" migrators -- which include shellfish, snails, starfish, worms and others -- share a few crucial traits. As larvae, they are weak swimmers and rely on ocean currents for transportation. As adults, they tend to remain in place, sedentary or fixed to the seafloor.The researchers found that the warming ocean have caused these creatures to spawn earlier in the spring or summer, exposing their larvae to patterns of wind and water currents they wouldn't experience during the normal spawning season. As a result, the larvae are pushed toward the southwest and inland, where waters are warmer and they are less likely to survive. The adults stay in those areas and are trapped in a feedback loop in which even warmer waters lead to even earlier spawning times and a further shrinking of their occupied areas.The researchers compared this phenomenon to ""elevator-to-extinction"" events in which increasing temperatures drive birds and butterflies upslope until they are eliminated from areas they once inhabited. The effect on bottom-dwelling invertebrates is more insidious, however, because these creatures could potentially thrive in cooler regions, but earlier-spring currents prevent weak-swimming larvae from reaching that refuge.The researchers noted that these effects are influenced by localized wind and current patterns. Further research is needed to determine whether the effects are similar on the U.S. Pacific coast or other ocean areas.",Climate,2020.0,"A new study has found that 80% of bottom-dwelling invertebrates have disappeared from the Georges Bank and the outer shelf between the Delmarva Peninsula and Cape Cod, including off the coast of New Jersey.

Such a leading role for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica in global climate has been speculated but seeing it so clearly in geological evidence was very exciting.""Professor Ian Hall, co-author of the study and co-chief scientist of the IODP Expedition, also from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: ""Our results provide the missing link into how Antarctica and the Southern Ocean responded to the natural rhythms of the climate system associated with our orbit around the sun.""Over the past 3 million years the Earth has regularly plunged into ice age conditions, but at present is currently situated within an interglacial period where temperatures are warmer.However, due to the increased global temperatures resulting from anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the researchers suggest the natural rhythm of ice age cycles may be disrupted as the Southern Ocean will likely become too warm for Antarctic icebergs to travel far enough to trigger the changes in ocean circulation required for an ice age to develop.Professor Hall believes that the results can be used to understand how our climate may respond to anthropogenic climate change in the future.""Likewise as we observe an increase in the mass loss from the Antarctic continent and iceberg activity in the Southern Ocean, resulting from warming associated with current human greenhouse-gas emissions, our study emphasises the importance of understanding iceberg trajectories and melt patterns in developing the most robust predictions of their future impact on ocean circulation and climate,"" he said.Professor Grant Bigg, from the University of Sheffield's Department of Geography, who contributed to the iceberg model simulations, said: ""The groundbreaking modelling of icebergs within the climate model is crucial for identifying and supporting the ice-rafted debris hypothesis of Antarctic iceberg meltwater impacts which are leading glacial cycle onsets.""The Cardiff University-led study was funded by NERC.",Climate,2021.0,"Melting icebergs in the Antarctic are the key to triggering a series of chain reactions that cause Earth to experience prolonged periods of cold temperatures, according to researchers from Cardiff University.

In a first step, modern humans settled along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Only then did they spread out into the Sinai desert and the eastern Jordanian Rift Valley. This is the result of archaeological research conducted by Collaborative Research Centre 'Our Way to Europe' (CRC 806) at the universities of Cologne, Bonn, and Aachen. The article 'Al-Ansab and the Dead Sea: mid-MIS 3 Archaeology and Environment of the Early Ahmarian Population of the Levantine Corridor' was published in ","For more than ten years, the team has been analysing sediments, pollen, and archaeological artefacts around the site of Al-Ansab 1 near the ancient ruin-city of Petra (Jordan). The goal was to gain an understanding of the environmental conditions that prevailed at the time of human expansion. 'Human presence consolidated in the region under favourable climate conditions', said Professor Dr Jürgen Richter, lead author of the study.The success story of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa began about 100,000 years ago with well-known sites such as Qafzeh and Skhul in Israel. However, these early records only reveal a brief, temporary expansion of the territory into the Levant. Permanent settlement of the region only dates back to about 43,000 years ago, scientists believe. During the epoch of the so-called 'Early Ahmarian', modern humans gradually had been spreading throughout the Levant -- a first step on their way to Asia and Europe.Favourable climatic conditions were preconditions for permanent human settlement. On a large scale, this is illustrated by the presence of the so-called Lake Lisan. This freshwater lake was located where the Dead Sea is today. However, it was of a much larger extent and carried greater water volume. Most of the water evaporated only with the end of the last ice age, leaving behind the hypersaline Dead Sea known today.Even on a small scale, the scientists were able to recognise the favourable environmental conditions: geo-archaeological teams from the University of Cologne and RWTH Aachen University examined the site of Al-Ansab 1. Whereas today, the Wadi Sabra, in which the site is located, is strongly shaped by seasonal flash floods, geomorphological and archaeological investigations showed that at the time of settlement, the conditions were less erosive and continuously wet, permitting the presence of humans.'This enabled the spread of humans from the coastal Mediterranean area to the formerly drier regions of the Negev desert and the eastern slopes of the Jordan Rift Valley. They hunted gazelles in the open landscape -- a prey we found in many sites in the region from this period', says Richter. 'Humans did not come by steady expansion out of Africa through the Levant and further to Europe and Asia. Rather, they first settled in a coastal strip along the Mediterranean Sea.'The region around the site of Al-Ansab 1 therefore was a stepping stone on Homo sapiens' way -- a journey that did not take a straight path to the European continent, but was guided by complex interactions between humans and their environment.",Climate,2020.0,"Scientists have gained insight into the environmental conditions that allowed humans to settle in the Levant region, including the area around Petra in Jordan.

The presence of Lake Lisan, a freshwater lake that was much larger than the Dead Sea, was an indication of these conditions.
